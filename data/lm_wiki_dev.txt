Prince Leopold Clement of Saxe-Coburg and GothaPrince Leopold Clement Philipp August Maria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ( 19 July 1878 in Szent-Antal , Hungary – 27 April 1916 in Vienna ) was an Austro-Hungarian officer and the heir apparent to the wealth of the House of Koháry .
His death in a murder-suicide shocked the royal courts of Austria and Germany . Prince Leopold Clement was the elder child and only son born in the troubled marriage of Princess Louise of Belgium and Prince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , both of whom were Roman Catholic members of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha .
He shared his name with his maternal grandfather , King Leopold II of Belgium , and a number of other Coburger relatives .
Prince Leopold Clement was the sole heir to the wealth his father &amp; apos ; s family had inherited from their ancestress , Princess Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág . A Hussar captain in the Austro-Hungarian Army , Prince Leopold Clement met a Viennese girl named Camilla Rybicka at a charity bazaar in 1913 .
Rybicka was one of the daughters of Court Councillor Rybicka , an officer in the Vienna State Police .
Then in her early twenties , she belonged to high society , but was nevertheless a commoner .
The two soon started a romantic relationship .
Rybicka left the family home , and the two travelled around the Austro-Hungarian Empire before settling down in an apartment in Vienna . Rybicka , however , was not satisfied with being only the Prince &amp; apos ; s lover and demanded that he marry her .
In Paris on 1 July 1914 , Prince Leopold Clement wrote her a letter , promising to marry her within six months , naming her his sole heir , and requesting his father to pay her 2 million Austro-Hungarian krones in the event of his death .
After Prince Leopold Clement was called to fight in the First World War , she insisted that he marry her before leaving .
Leopold Clement was aware that such a mesalliance would have deprived him of the fortune he stood to inherit because his father had no intention of permitting the union , and that marrying Rybicka would have forced him to resign his officer &amp; apos ; s commission . When her pleas , intrigues and threats all failed to secure her marriage to Leopold Clement , she was offered 4 million Austro-Hungarian krones as compensation .
On 17 October 1915 , the Prince called her to his first-floor flat in Vienna to say goodbye and sign the cheque , but Rybicka did not intend to take the money .
Instead , she fired five shots at him at close range and then smashed a bottle of sulfuric acid in his face , before firing the sixth bullet through her heart .
Neighbours testified that they heard him scream in agony .
The half-naked Rybicka was lying dead by the bed when the police came , but the Prince was alive on the floor and still screaming .
Rybicka was cremated in Jena , Germany in December 1915 .
Having lost an eye and much of the flesh on his face , Prince Leopold Clement died after six months of suffering .
His remains were interred in the vault of St .
Augustin in Coburg . Following the death of his only son , Prince Philipp bequeathed his fortune to his grandnephew , Prince Philipp Josias .
The deaths of Prince Leopold Clement and Camilla Rybicka shocked the royal courts of Austria and Germany .
They were reminiscent of the 1889 Mayerling Incident , a murder-suicide involving Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria , Prince Leopold Clement &amp; apos ; s maternal uncle , and Rudolf &amp; apos ; s teenage mistress , Baroness Mary Vetsera .

Petroglyph CanyonPetroglyph Canyon ( 24CB601 ) is an archaeologically significant canyon in the northwestern United States .
Located on both sides of the border between Montana and Wyoming , the canyon has long been obscure due to its small size .
However , it gained substantial attention in the late 20th century because of its numerous prehistoric petroglyphs , and much of it was named a historic site in the 1970s . Petroglyph Canyon &amp; apos ; s most significant portion is located in the southern half of Section 35 , Township 9 South , Range 26 East , within far southern Carbon County , Montana .
The entire canyon runs in a northwest-southeast direction for approximately , beginning 1 mile north of the most significant area and extending approximately into Big Horn County , Wyoming .
The walls and boulders in the canyon are primarily sandstone , having been weathered to a dark brown color , although under the surface the stone is a lighter tan color . A portion of the canyon measuring approximately long features numerous prehistoric petroglyphs , both on the canyon walls and on boulders .
At least eighteen different groups of carvings are known , in addition to features such as hearths and small pieces of stone resulting from the manufacturing process for stone tools .
Most of the petroglyphs were created by &amp; quot ; pecking &amp; quot ; tiny holes , although one group is formed of lines that were clearly engraved into the rock .
The majority of designs at Petroglyph Canyon feature humans or large game animals such as bison and bighorn sheep .
Some carvings clearly feature men or women , many of which appear with sexual imagery such as phallic symbols or external female genitalia respectively .
Some of the carvings are old enough that they have begun to weather to the dark color of the surrounding stone , but most show little sign of erosion .
A few designs at the site , such as personal names , have obviously been added much more recently by vandals , but such carvings are rare and were typically placed near older designs instead of on top of them . Petroglyph Canyon received its present name in 1967 , when an archaeological survey discovered the carvings ; it had appeared on numerous maps published since 1859 , but no map published before 1967 provided a name for the canyon .
The first &amp; quot ; official &amp; quot ; use of the current name was made in 1975 , when the canyon was listed on the National Register of Historic Places ; it appears on the National Register as &amp; quot ; Petroglyph Canyon &amp; quot ; .
Since that time , the name has commonly been used by agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service , as well as by local residents .
In 1992 , the Board on Geographic Names officially gave the canyon its current name . The canyon was listed on the National Register as an important archaeological site , as modern vandalism — whether carvings or occasional digging into the canyon &amp; apos ; s stone-tool manufacturing sites — had been unable to diminish its unparalleled quality .
Petroglyph sites have been found throughout Montana , but &amp; quot ; pecked &amp; quot ; sites are far rarer than in states such as Wyoming or Utah , and Petroglyph Canyon features a broader range of artwork with less deterioration than almost any other Montana rock art site .
When the site was listed , Bureau of Land Management archaeologists hoped to conduct future work at the site to compare it with other rock art sites in the region .
Because the site &amp; apos ; s styles more closely resemble what has been found at distant sites than they do other nearby sites , it is hoped that such comparisons will reveal the migration patterns of the peoples who created sites such as Petroglyph Canyon .

The Theory of Everything ( 2014 film ) The Theory of Everything is a 2014 British biographical romantic drama film which is set at Cambridge University and details the life of the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking .
It was directed by James Marsh , and adapted by Anthony McCarten from the memoir &amp; quot ; Travelling to Infinity : My Life with Stephen &amp; quot ; by Jane Hawking , which deals with her relationship with her ex-husband , theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking , his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS , also known as Lou Gehrig &amp; apos ; s disease or motor neurone disease ) , and his success in physics . The film stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones , with Charlie Cox , Emily Watson , Simon McBurney , Christian McKay , Harry Lloyd , and David Thewlis featured in supporting roles .
The film had its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2014 .
It had its UK premiere on 1 January 2015 . The film received positive reviews , with praise for the musical score , cinematography , and the performance of Felicity Jones and especially Eddie Redmayne , which earned him nominations for a variety of accolades in award shows and film festivals ; including winning the Academy Award for Best Actor .

It also received three Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations ; winning one for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for Redmayne . At the University of Cambridge , astrophysics student Stephen Hawking begins a romantic relationship with literature student Jane Wilde .
Although Stephen excels at mathematics and physics , his friends and professors are concerned over his lack of a thesis topic .
After Stephen and his professor Dennis Sciama attend a lecture on black holes , Stephen speculates that black holes may have been part of the creation of the universe , and decides to write his thesis on time . While pursuing his research , Stephen &amp; apos ; s muscles begin to fail , eventually causing him to fall and hit his head .
He learns he has motor neurone disease ; he will be unable to talk , swallow , breathe , or move most of his body ; and has approximately two years to live .
Stephen asks what will happen to his brain .
The doctor tells Stephen that the disease will not affect it or his thoughts , but that eventually , no one will know what they are .
As Stephen becomes reclusive , focusing on his work , Jane confesses she loves him .
She tells Stephen &amp; apos ; s father she intends to stay with Stephen even as his condition worsens .
They marry and have a son . Stephen presents his thesis to the examination board , arguing that a black hole created the universe in a Big Bang , that it will emit heat , and that it will end in a Big Crunch .
While celebrating with Jane and his friends , Stephen realises he cannot walk , and begins using a wheelchair . After having a second child , a daughter , Stephen develops a theory about the visibility of black holes , and becomes a world-renowned physicist .
Jane , focusing on the children and on Stephen &amp; apos ; s health and increasing fame , is unable to work on her own thesis and becomes frustrated .
Stephen tells her he will understand if she needs help .
She joins the church choir , where she meets widower Jonathan and they become close friends .
She employs him as a piano teacher for her son and Jonathan befriends the entire family , helping Stephen with his illness , supporting Jane , and playing with the children . When Jane gives birth to another son , Stephen &amp; apos ; s mother asks Jane if the baby is Jonathan &amp; apos ; s , which she denies .
Jane sees that Jonathan overheard the conversation , and is appalled , but when they are alone , they admit their feelings for one another .
Jonathan stays away from the family , but Stephen visits him , saying that Jane needs him . While Jane and Jonathan take the children camping , Stephen is invited to attend an opera performance in Bordeaux , and contracts pneumonia .
While in the hospital , the doctors tell Jane that Stephen needs a tracheotomy , which will leave him unable to speak .
She agrees to the surgery . Stephen learns to use a spelling board , and uses it to communicate with Elaine , his new nurse .
He receives a computer with a built-in voice synthesiser , and uses it to write a book , &amp; quot ; A Brief History of Time &amp; quot ; , which becomes an international best-seller . Stephen tells Jane that he has been invited to America to accept an award , and will be taking Elaine with him .
Jane faces the realisation that her and Stephen &amp; apos ; s marriage has not been working , telling him she &amp; quot ; did her best &amp; quot ; .
Jane and Stephen agree to divorce .
Stephen goes to the lecture with Elaine , the two having fallen in love , and Jane and Jonathan reunite .
At the lecture , Stephen sees a student drop a pen ; he imagines getting up to return it , almost crying at the reminder of how his disease has affected him .
He goes on to give an inspiring speech , saying , &amp; quot ; There should be no boundaries to human endeavour .
We are all different .
However bad life may seem , there is always something you can do , and succeed at .
While there &amp; apos ; s life , there is hope &amp; quot ; . Stephen invites Jane to meet Queen Elizabeth II with him to receive his Order of the Companions of Honour ; they share a happy day together with their children , with Stephen saying &amp; quot ; Look what we made &amp; quot ; . An extended closing series comprises select moments from the film ; shown in reverse , back to the moment Stephen first saw Jane .
A final title sequence brings the lives of the lead characters up to date .
Jane and Jonathan are happily married , and she has completed her PhD .
She and Stephen remain close friends .
Stephen declines a knighthood from the Queen and continues his research , with no plans to retire . The title &amp; quot ; The Theory of Everything &amp; quot ; had been used before , inter alia , the title of a fictitious book mentioned in Andy Hamilton &amp; apos ; s 1995-2012 BBC radio series , &amp; quot ; Old Harry &amp; apos ; s Game &amp; quot ; , a 2006 TV film , and a 2008 episode of &amp; quot ; CSI : Crime Scene Investigation &amp; quot ; .
Screenwriter Anthony McCarten had been interested in Hawking since reading his seminal book &amp; quot ; A Brief History of Time &amp; quot ; in 1988 .
In 2004 , McCarten read Jane Hawking &amp; apos ; s memoir &amp; quot ; Travelling to Infinity : My Life with Stephen &amp; quot ; , and subsequently began writing a screenplay adaptation of the book , with no guarantees in place .
He met numerous times with Jane at her home to discuss the project .
After multiple drafts , he was introduced in 2009 to producer Lisa Bruce via their mutual ICM agent , Craig Bernstein . Bruce spent three years with McCarten , further convincing Jane Hawking to agree to a film adaptation of her book , with Bruce stating , &amp; quot ; It was a lot of conversation , many glasses of sherry , and many pots of tea &amp; quot ; .
On 18 April 2013 , James Marsh was confirmed to direct the film , with the shooting being based in Cambridge , and at other locations in the United Kingdom , with Eddie Redmayne courted to fill the male lead of the piece .
On 23 June 2013 , it was revealed that Felicity Jones was confirmed to play the film &amp; apos ; s female lead role opposite Redmayne .
On 8 October 2013 , it was confirmed that Emily Watson and David Thewlis had joined the cast , Christina Applegate , Kate del Castillo , Catherine Tate , and Amanda Peet were considered for the part , and that Working Title &amp; apos ; s Tim Bevan , Eric Fellner , Lisa Bruce , and Anthony McCarten would be producing the piece . Filmmaker Marsh had studied archival images to give the film its authenticity , stating , &amp; quot ; When we had photographs and documentary footage of Stephen that related to our story , we tried to reproduce them as best we could &amp; quot ; .
Redmayne met with Hawking himself , commenting , &amp; quot ; Even now , when he &amp; apos ; s unable to move , you can still see such effervescence in his eyes &amp; quot ; .
And described portraying Hawking on-screen as a &amp; quot ; hefty &amp; quot ; challenge , adding that , &amp; quot ; The real problem with making a film is of course you don &amp; apos ; t shoot chronologically .
So it was about having to really try and chart his physical deterioration &amp; # 91 ; so &amp; # 93 ; you can jump into it day-to-day , whilst at the same time keeping this spark and wit and humour that he has &amp; quot ; . Redmayne spent six months researching Hawking &amp; apos ; s life , watching every piece of interview footage he could find of him .
He studied Hawking &amp; apos ; s accent and speech patterns under dialect coach Julia Wilson-Dickson to prepare for the role .
Marsh stated that what Redmayne had to do was not easy .
&amp; quot ; He had to take on enormous amounts of difficult preparation , as well as embracing the difficult physicality of the role .
It &amp; apos ; s not just doing a disability .
It &amp; apos ; s actually charting the course of an illness that erodes the body , and the mind has to project out from that erosion &amp; quot ; , he said .
He added that Hawking gave him his blessing , and also revealed that , &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; Hawking &amp; apos ; s &amp; # 93 ; response was very positive , so much so that he offered to lend his voice , the real voice that he uses .
The voice you hear in the latter part of the story is in fact Stephen &amp; apos ; s actual electronic voice as he uses it &amp; quot ; , he said .
It was revealed to the Toronto International Film Festival ( TIFF ) audience that as the lights came up at a recent screening , a nurse had wiped a tear from Hawking &amp; apos ; s cheek . Jane Hawking , speaking on BBC Radio 4 &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Woman &amp; apos ; s Hour &amp; quot ; , talked of meeting Jones several times while the latter prepared for the role .
When Hawking saw the finished film , she was amazed to see that Jones had incorporated her mannerisms and speech patterns into her performance . By 8 October 2013 , principal photography had begun , with the shooting being done at Cambridge University , and at other locations in Cambridgeshire and across the United Kingdom .
Prior to the start of principal photography , Working Title had begun shooting on the lawn in front of the New Court building from 23 September 2013 to 27 September 2013 ; they filmed the Cambridge May Ball scene , set in 1963 .
On 24 September 2013 , scenes were filmed at St John &amp; apos ; s College , The Backs in Queen &amp; apos ; s Road , and Queen &amp; apos ; s Green .
The New Court lawn and Kitchen Bridge were included features in the filming location of the piece .
The May Ball scene was the last of the outside shoots , with filming in a lecture theatre the following day , and the remaining filming completed in the studio over the final five weeks of production . The pyrotechnic specialists Titanium Fireworks , who developed the displays for the London 2012 Olympic Games , provided three identical firework displays for the Trinity College , Cambridge May Ball scene . Composer Jóhann Jóhannsson scored &amp; quot ; The Theory of Everything &amp; quot ; .
His score in the film has been described as including &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; Jóhannsson &amp; apos ; s &amp; # 93 ; signature blend of acoustic instruments and electronics &amp; quot ; .
Jóhannsson commented that &amp; quot ; it always involves the layers of live recordings , whether it &amp; apos ; s orchestra or a band or solo instrument , with electronics and more &amp; apos ; soundscapey &amp; apos ; elements which can come from various sources &amp; quot ; .
Jóhannsson &amp; apos ; s score was highly praised , being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score , a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music , a Critics &amp; apos ; Choice Movie Award for Best Score and a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media , winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score .
The soundtrack was recorded at Abbey Road Studios . During editing , filmmakers tried to remake Hawking &amp; apos ; s synthesised voice , but it did not turn out as they wanted .
Hawking enjoyed the film enough that he granted them permission to use his own synthesised voice , which is heard in the final film . The film takes various dramatic liberties with the history it portrays .
Writing for the film blog of UK daily newspaper &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; , Michelle Dean noted : &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; The Theory of Everything &amp; quot ; &amp; apos ; s marketing materials will tell you it is based on Jane Hawking &amp; apos ; s memoir of her marriage , a book published in the UK as &amp; quot ; Music to Move the Stars &amp; quot ; , and then re-issued as &amp; quot ; Travelling to Infinity &amp; quot ; .
But the screenwriters rearranged the facts to suit certain dramatic conventions .
And while that always happens in these based-on-a-true-story films , the scale of the departure in &amp; quot ; The Theory of Everything &amp; quot ; is unusually wide .
The film becomes almost dishonest – in a way that feels unfair to both parties , and oddly , particularly Jane Hawking herself &amp; quot ; .
In &amp; quot ; Slate &amp; quot ; , L . V .
Anderson wrote that &amp; quot ; the Stephen played by Eddie Redmayne is far gentler and more sensitive &amp; quot ; than suggested in &amp; quot ; Travelling to Infinity &amp; quot ; .
The &amp; quot ; Slate &amp; quot ; article further noted that the character Brian , Hawking &amp; apos ; s closest friend at Cambridge in the film , is not based on a real individual , but rather a composite of several of his real-life friends . The film alters some of the details surrounding the beginning of Stephen and Jane &amp; apos ; s relationship , including how they met , as well as the fact that Jane knew about Stephen &amp; apos ; s disease before they started dating .
&amp; quot ; Slate &amp; quot ; also comments that the film underplays Hawking &amp; apos ; s stubbornness and refusal to accept outside assistance for his disorder . For &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; , Dean concluded by saying : &amp; quot ; The movie presents the demise of their relationship as a beautiful , tear-soaked , mutually respectful conversation .
Of course that didn &amp; apos ; t actually happen either .
Jane &amp; apos ; s book describes a protracted breakup that comes to a head in a screaming fight on vacation .
She also described devastation when Hawking announced by letter he was leaving her for his second wife , Elaine Mason .
He ended up married to Mason for 10 years before that fell apart , and then he and Jane mended fences .
Which , as it happens , the movie fudges too .
It tries to present the rapprochement as coming when Hawking was made a Companion of Honour in 1989 , but that actually happened before the couple separated &amp; quot ; . Physicist Adrian Melott , a former student of Dennis Sciama , Hawking &amp; apos ; s doctoral supervisor portrayed in the film , strongly criticised the portrayal of Sciama in the film . On 8 October 2013 , Universal Pictures International had acquired the rights to distribute the film internationally . On 10 April 2014 , Focus Features acquired the distribution rights to &amp; quot ; The Theory of Everything &amp; quot ; in the United States , with the plan of a 2014 limited theatrical release .
publisher after , Entertainment One Films picked up the Canadian distribution rights .
The first trailer of the film was released on 7 August 2014 . &amp; quot ; The Theory of Everything &amp; quot ; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival ( TIFF ) on 7 September 2014 , where it opened in the official sidebar section , Special Presentations . The film had a limited release in the United States on 7 November 2014 , expanded in successive weeks to Taiwan , Austria , and Germany , ahead of a United Kingdom release on 1 January 2015 , before being released throughout Europe . &amp; quot ; The Theory of Everything &amp; quot ; earned US $ 122,873,310 worldwide , with its biggest markets coming from North America ( US $ 35 . 9 million ) , and the United Kingdom ( US $ 31 . 9 million ) .
The film had a North American limited release on 7 November 2014 ; it was released in five theatres , and earned US $ 207,000 on its opening weekend , for an average of US $ 41,400 per theatre .
The film was then widely released on 26 November across 802 theatres , earning US $ 5 million , and debuting at No .
7 at the Box Office .
During its five-day Thanksgiving week , the film earned US $ 6 . 4 million . Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 79 % based on 236 reviews , with an average rating of 7 . 3 / 10 .
The site &amp; apos ; s critical consensus reads , &amp; quot ; Part biopic , part love story , &amp; quot ; The Theory of Everything &amp; quot ; rises on James Marsh &amp; apos ; s polished direction and the strength of its two leads . &amp; quot ; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 , based on 47 critics , indicating &amp; quot ; generally favorable reviews &amp; quot ; . Catherine Shoard of &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; wrote , &amp; quot ; Redmayne towers : this is an astonishing , genuinely visceral performance which bears comparison with Daniel Day-Lewis in &amp; quot ; My Left Foot &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
Lou Lumenick , in his review for &amp; quot ; The New York Post &amp; quot ; , called the film &amp; quot ; tremendously moving and inspirational &amp; quot ; .
Justin Chang of &amp; quot ; Variety &amp; quot ; remarked , &amp; quot ; A stirring and bittersweet love story , inflected with tasteful good humor . . . &amp; quot ; He continued by praising the &amp; quot ; superb performances &amp; quot ; from Redmayne and Jones , as well commenting very positively about Jóhannsson &amp; apos ; s score , &amp; quot ; whose arpeggio-like repetitions and progressions at times evoke the compositions of Philip Glass &amp; quot ; , whilst praising John Paul Kelly &amp; apos ; s production design , and Steven Noble &amp; apos ; s costumes .
Leslie Felperin of &amp; quot ; The Hollywood Reporter &amp; quot ; remarked , &amp; quot ; A solid , duly moving account of their complicated relationship , spanning roughly 25 years , and made with impeccable professional polish &amp; quot ; , praising Delhomme &amp; apos ; s cinematography as having &amp; quot ; lush , intricately lit compositions &amp; quot ; , and adding &amp; quot ; a splendor that keeps the film consistently watchable &amp; quot ; , and Jóhannsson &amp; apos ; s score as &amp; quot ; dainty precision with a ineffable scientific quality about it &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; The Daily Telegraph &amp; quot ; s Tim Robey granted the film a positive review , stating that , &amp; quot ; In its potted appraisal of Hawking &amp; apos ; s cosmology , &amp; quot ; The Theory of Everything &amp; quot ; bends over backwards to speak to the layman , and relies on plenty of second-hand inspiration .
But it borrows from the right sources , this theory .
And that &amp; apos ; s something &amp; quot ; , while praising Redmayne &amp; apos ; s performance , McCarten &amp; apos ; s script , and Delhomme &amp; apos ; s cinematography .
&amp; quot ; Deadline Hollywood &amp; quot ; s Pete Hammond marked McCarten &amp; apos ; s script and Marsh &amp; apos ; s direction for praise , and of the film &amp; apos ; s Toronto reception , wrote : &amp; quot ; To say the response here was rapturous would not be understating the enthusiasm I heard — not just from pundits , but also Academy voters with whom I spoke .
One told me he came in with high expectations for a quality movie , and this one exceeded them &amp; quot ; . The film was not without its detractors .
Some criticised Marsh &amp; apos ; s focus on Hawking &amp; apos ; s romantic life .
Alonso Duralde of &amp; quot ; The Wrap &amp; quot ; stated that &amp; quot ; Hawking &amp; apos ; s innovations and refusal to subscribe to outdated modes of thinking merely underscore the utter conventionality of his film biography &amp; quot ; .
Eric Kohn of &amp; quot ; Indiewire &amp; quot ; added that &amp; quot ; James Marsh &amp; apos ; s biopic salutes the famous physicist &amp; apos ; s commitment , but falls short of exploring his brilliant ideas &amp; quot ; .
Dennis Overbye of the &amp; quot ; New York Times &amp; quot ; noted that &amp; quot ; the movie doesn &amp; apos ; t deserve any prizes for its drive-by muddling of Dr .

AltenbrunslarAltenbunslar is one of the sixteen constituent communities that form the town of Felsberg in Schwalm-Eder-Kreis , North Hesse , Germany .
The nearest city is Kassel , which is to the north . The boundary of the village encompasses an area of about , of which about 80 % is covered by forest .
Approximately 350 people live in the village . The village is situated on the eastern ( cut ) bank of the Eder River .
To the east of the village is the &amp; quot ; Quillerwald &amp; quot ; ( ) or &amp; quot ; Markwald &amp; quot ; ( ) , the latter so-called because once it belonged to all the surrounding villages , at least in terms of the right to cut wood and graze animals , but not hunting .
The Eder River confluences with the Fulda River just upstream from Altenbrunslar at Edermünde ( ) . The bedrock is composed of Triassic Buntsandstein .
It is so-called because it is composed of different-coloured sandstones .
The rolling hills that are caused by the nearly even weathering of the sandstones , are punctuated by steep basaltic outcrops , which are the remains of Neogene ( Miocene ) volcanic necks ( i . e . the cone of the volcano has been eroded which left behind the harder central region ( neck ) where the magma previously made its way to the surface ) . The Rhünda Skull , found near the town of Rhünda , which is just south of Felsberg , proves that this area was populated already 12000years ago .
Archaeological finds show that around c . 2900 – 2450cal .
BC , in the nearby Quiller Forest , a prehistoric people of the Corded Ware culture settled .
During the building of the A7 motorway in 1935 , many burial mounds were found on &amp; quot ; Schleifsteinskopf &amp; quot ; , a hill within Quiller Forest ( see above ) .
At around the same time , the Riesenstein , a menhir weighing more than , was erected close to Wolfershausen . The first mention of the place &amp; quot ; Bruneslar &amp; quot ; was in 1154 .
The first recognised use of the name &amp; quot ; Altenbrunslar &amp; quot ; was in a document from 1381 , in the list of possessions of Friedrich III von Hertingshausen ( † 1422 ) , a knight from the surrounding area . After the Protestant Reformation , Altenbrunslar welcomed a monk from the Breitenau Monastery as the first Protestant preacher in 1532 . In 1639 , the village was named &amp; quot ; Altenbraunßlar &amp; quot ; in the &amp; quot ; hessische Mannschaftsregister &amp; quot ; . Brunslar has always been an important location for armies to cross the River Eder .
For instance , in the Seven Years &amp; apos ; War , when in 1760 John Manners , Marquess of Granby lead his troops to confront the French , he bridged the River Eder at Brunslar . The first section of the Main – Weser Railway between Kassel and Wabern , running directly through Altenbrunslar , was opened on 29 December 1849 .
The first train to pass through Altenbrunslar was pulled by the Henschel locomotive &amp; quot ; Hassia &amp; quot ; The first continuous rail service from Kassel to Frankfurt ran on 15 May 1852 , although there wasn &amp; apos ; t a railway station at Altenbrunslar to start with .
After petitioning , a station was constructed in 1902 . During the Second World War , the Allies bombed and breached the Edersee Dam in the night of 16 – 17May1943 , as part of Operation Chastise .
The resultant flood wave hit Altenbrunslar half an hour later ( the dam is about upstream ) .
The population of Altenbrunslar fled into the forest after they were warned by radio .
The whole Eder Valley and most of the village was flooded , but the bridge mostly stood up to the water and only the upper part was in need of repair afterwards .
A number of houses close to the river were damaged . From 1413 to 1807 and from 1813 to 1821 , Altenbrunslar belonged to the administration of Felsberg , from 1807 to 1813 to the Canton of Gensungen of Napoleon &amp; apos ; s Kingdom of Westphalia , and from 1821 onwards to the District of Melsungen ( Landkreis Melsungen ) , which , in 1866 , became part of the Kingdom of Prussia .
On the 1 February 1971 , Altenbrunslar joined Neuenbrunslar to become the &amp; quot ; Brunslar Community &amp; quot ; .
This was incorporated into the town of Felsberg on 1 January 1974 . The first permanent sandstone bridge over the Eder River at Altenbrunslar was built in 1885 .
Before this bridge , there was only a temporary wooden bridge in summer and a ferryman in winter . The small , evangelical chapel in Altenbrunslar is an object of cultural heritage .
It was originally built , probably at the beginning of the 10th century , in the romanesque style , but later a gothic style choir was added .
Above the aisle is a half-timbered upper level that was constructed in 1681 .
The upper level was used in the past as a granary . In 2000 , the chapel was completely renovated . The church bell is reported to have come from the nearby ruined village of Brechelsdorf .
On the bell is written in Gothic script : &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; im jahr des herren 1487 gegrüßt seist du maria &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( ) . The village has its own railway station .
NVV trains connects to the north with the main Intercity-Express railway station at Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe in 22 minutes , and then they travel on to Kassel main station .
To the south Wabern is 16 minutes away . The bridge over the Eder at Altenbrunslar is an important traffic route in North Hesse .
The Landesstraße ( state road ) L3222 crosses the bridge from Neuenbrunslar towards Melsungen , and is joined in Altenbrunslar by the Kreisstraße ( district road ) K151 from Ellenberg . On the weekend of 5 – 6 September 2015 , Alten- and Neunenbrunslar held a bridge party ( German : Brückenfest Brunslar ) to celebrate the sandstone bridge over the Eder .
Otto W .
Werren , a local artist , had the idea to weave old fire brigade hoses , which have a bright yellow-green colour , into the posts of the handrails on the side of the bridge .
This was carried out by the youth of the villages .
For the weekend , the bridge was illuminated with different coloured lights . Altenbrunslar was chosen as &amp; quot ; Dolles Dorf &amp; quot ; ( English : great village ) in the Hessischer Rundfunk television programme of the same name .
A ten-minute film about the village was broadcast on 25 August 2012 .
Palazzo del ViminaleThe Palazzo del Viminale is an historic palace in Rome ( Italy ) , seat of the Prime Minister and of the Ministry of Interior since 1925 ; in 1961 the Prime Minister was transferred to Palazzo Chigi .

The boardrooms of the Minister are placed in a side complex , linked to the main building by an arched junction . The gardens and the terraces are overbuilded and abut with the surrounding streets , standing out of the road surface . The back gardens separate the main complex from smaller buildings .
In fact , almost opposite to the back façade there is the little palace that housed the Royal Institute for Physics , in which Enrico Fermi carried out his experiments together with the &amp; quot ; Via Panisperna boys &amp; quot ; ( so called because the little palace is closer to the exit on Via Panisperna ) .
The palace also housed the Royal Institute for Chemistry . The main building houses many libraries : It also houses bank tellers , post offices and many coffee shops .

EppingtonEppington is a historic plantation house located near Winterpock , Chesterfield County , Virginia .
It was built about 1768 , and consists of a three-bay , 2 1 / 2-story , central block with hipped roof , dormers , modillion cornice , and flanking one-story wings in the Georgian style .
It has a later two-story rear ell .
It features two tall exterior end chimneys which rise from the roof of the wings .
Its builder , Francis Eppes , was brother-in-law and first cousin of Martha Jefferson ( 1748 – 1782 ) , the wife of Thomas Jefferson .
After her death , Eppes and his wife raised Jefferson &amp; apos ; s two daughters , while their father was Minister to France .
Charles Eppes sent samples of American trees , including Bald Cypress , Eastern Red Cedar , Southern Magnolia and Wax-myrtle as well as hams from Monticello to Thomas Jefferson in France at Thomas Jefferson &amp; apos ; s request .
Daughters of the Eppes studied natural and agricultural sciences , noting what times of year crops came in as well as when Eastern whip-poor-wills arrived and started singing .
One of the daughters , Lucy Elizabeth , died in 1784 and was buried at Eppington .
Mary ( Polly ) Jefferson ( 1778 – 1804 ) , married in 1797 her cousin , John Wayles Eppes ( 1772 – 1823 ) and spent much of her time at Eppington . In 1790 , Charles Eppes had 124 slaves and 2 white overseers living on Eppington .
The yard near the house was a service yard , an area for the house slaves to do work such as smoking country ham , milking cows , churning butter and drawing water from a well .
A fence line appears to have kept the field slaves separate from house slaves .
The service yard was hidden from visitors with tended gardens , orchards and lawns .
The value of the slave &amp; apos ; s labor added greatly to the wealth of the plantation until the American Civil War .
As early as 1806 , a school building was on the property .
Later , by the mid-eighteen hundreds , the building was converted into a kitchen to replace a previous building that had been the kitchen . Archibald Thweatt acquired Eppington over several purchases starting on December 1812 .
Epps Falls , at Eppington , were deemed dangerous for passing boats by the Virginia General Assembly .
The General Assembly , in 1819 , gave Archibald Thweatt , owner of Eppington , compensation from any damages but allowed the Upper Appomattox Canal company to build a dam and locks around the falls .
Archibald Thweatt and his heirs were also given leave to build a grist mill on the dam .
Archibald Thweatt raised Merino wool .
Also , in 1819 , he made a land arrangement which was critical to keep open the right of way road from Richmond to Petersburg . When the Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System was complete , neighboring farmers could ship farm produce from the docks at Eppington .
There were large loading facilities .
When coal was first mined at the Clover Hill Pits , in 1837 , it was taken by mule , later by rail , to the docks at Epps Falls .
A boat that could carry seven tons of coal , made a four-day round trip to Petersburg for two dollars and thirty eight cents .
Rail Service to the docks was discontinued when the Clover Hill Railroad was built to the James River .
But it was latter added back when the successor , the Brighthope Railway was expanded in 1881 . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 .

Zofiówka SanatoriumZofiówka Sanatorium is a defunct mental health facility in the town of Otwock in Poland , built at the beginning of the 20th century .
In the Second Polish Republic , the sanatorium complex was expanded with more buildings and staff .
Zofiówka initially had 95 beds , but this number had increased to 275 by 1935 .
The Jewish history of Zofiówka came to its end in the course of the Holocaust following the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany .
The history of the old Jewish sanatorium starts at the beginning of the 20th century .
Back then , the institutionalized treatment of mental disorders was in its infancy .
In 1906 , Polish-Jewish neurologists Adam Wizel , Samuel Goldflam , Ludwik Bregman and Adolf Weisblat formed the &amp; quot ; Society for Poor Jews with Nervous and Mental Illnesses &amp; quot ; ( ) .
The sanatorium &amp; apos ; s director was Dr .
Stefan Miller .
A year later , a donation by the philanthropist Sophia Endelman enabled the purchase of 17 hectares of land and in 1908 the first building of a new sanatorium was built by the association there .
An important part of the treatment was restoring patients to society by enabling them to practice employment .
In its isolation ward ( part of the hospital reserved for the most difficult patients ) , the mother of famous Polish poet , Julian Tuwim , Adela Tuwim was placed before World War II . In late 1940 , may the asylum fell within the so-called ‘ medical zone ’ formed by the Germans in the newly established Jewish ghetto of Otwock .
The institution was still working during the early stages of the occupation of Poland , but the conditions dramatically worsened .
Almost 400 patients were sentenced to a slow and torturous death by starvation as part of the Nazi extermination &amp; quot ; Aktionen &amp; quot ; .
Zofiówka ended its existence at the same time as ghetto in Otwock . On the morning of 19 August 1942 , the Ukrainian Trawnikis supervised by the Germans , gathered the patients and the hospital crew in the first pavilion .
Some 100-140 victims were shot on the spot , the rest were put on the Holocaust train to Treblinka along with Otwock ’ s Jewish population of 7,000 .
Only a few doctors , who managed to escape to Warsaw by ambulance , survived .
Some of the staff people committed suicide . In 1943 Zofiówka served Germans as Lebensborn , the institution of charity care .
The facility also dealt with the Germanization of Polish children , and bringing them up for adoption to families in Germany . Zofiówka returned to his original medical purposes after the Soviet takeover , but the patients were mainly children and young people .
Between 1985 and the mid-1990s , the facilities were used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders associated with drug addiction .
This continued until the decision was made to finally close it . In 2015 , the viral video called 11B-X-1371 was found filmed in the abandoned facility , but who did it and when , exactly , it was not known until an individual named Parker Warner Wright claimed to have created the video .
He told &amp; quot ; The Daily Dot &amp; quot ; that it was supposed to be an art project , and he released a sequel video , &amp; quot ; 11B-3-1369 .

Tyler ZiegelTyler W .
&amp; quot ; Ty &amp; quot ; Ziegel ( October 16 , 1982 – December 26 , 2012 ) was a United States Marine Corps sergeant who suffered severe burns during the Iraq War .
He received the Purple Heart medal . Ty Ziegel was born in Peoria , Illinois and was the eldest of two sons of Jeffrey and Rebecca Ziegel .
Tyler &amp; apos ; s father worked in construction , his mother was a waitress .
After school Ziegel joined the U . S .
Marine Corps .
In 2003 , after boot camp , he was sent to Iraq . On December 22 , 2004 , Marine Sgt .
Ziegel and six other marines were part of a convoy coming back to Al Asad Air Base from al-Qaim , northwestern Iraq , when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device near their truck . Ziegel survived but suffered serious injuries : left arm was later amputated below the elbow , three fingers of his right hand were lost , in place of the thumb the big toe was transplanted ; Ziegel became blind in one eye ; his ears , nose and lips were burnt off .
He also had shrapnel in his skull and a hole in the bone above the brow .
For future use part of Ziegel &amp; apos ; s skull was implanted into the fatty tissues of the upper part of his body and artificial plate was placed instead of it .
Ty also lost his tear duct , replaced by a prosthesis .
As well , some parts of the face that were lost failed to recover even after more than 30 surgeries . On October 7 , 2006 , shortly after discharge from the hospital , Tyler Ziegel married Renée Kline , whom he met before being sent to Iraq .
They got engaged during Ty &amp; apos ; s short vacation , when Renée &amp; apos ; s father died in an accident .
Ty and Renée &amp; apos ; s wedding was widely reported by the press in the United States .
Their marriage day was declared a holiday in Illinois .
The wedding was attended by American photographer Nina Berman .
She took a series of shots , one of which won First Prize among portraits on World Press Photo . A year after the wedding Ziegel and Kline divorced .
The reason for the divorce , according to them , was the haste with which they were married , and ill-considered decision to marry . After the tragedy Ziegel tried to live a socially active life .
He was not able to work and United States Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) paid him benefits .
However in 2007 Ziegel had to start a dispute with VA over the size of the monthly compensation .
Instead of the expected $ 4000 , initially he was awarded $ 2700 , which , according to Ty , was not enough to comfortably raise a family .
Then Ziegel took part in a CNN program &amp; quot ; Special Investigations Unit &amp; quot ; , after which his financial demands were met .
That program attracted attention of a wide audience : a large number of people expressed their support to Ty .
Among them was a World War II veteran Hershel Williams – a retired United States Marine , who received the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Battle of Iwo Jima . The family announced that Ziegel died on December 26 , 2012 after falling on ice .
About 2,000 flags lined the streets of Metamora for miles in memory of Sgt .
Ziegel . In February 2013 the Governor of Illinois Pat Quinn in his State of the State address referred to the history of Ziegel as an example of the courage needed to state legislators .
He said : &amp; quot ; What we all need in this coming session is courage , real political courage to do the right thing .
We don &amp; apos ; t need to look any further for examples of courage than our men and women in uniform .
Men like Sergeant Tyler Ziegel , a proud Marine who grew up in Metamora , Illinois . . . &amp; quot ; In early May 2013 , after an investigation of Ziegel &amp; apos ; s death , Peoria County Coroner Johnna Ingersoll said that death was caused by alcohol and drug intoxication , not by the fall .
The analysis showed that Ziegel had a blood alcohol level of . 123 and a level of morphine indicating the presence of heroin was 540 ng / ml .
None of these values are lethal in themselves .
The cause of death , according to Ingersoll , was the combination of these substances .
Coroner &amp; apos ; s jury acknowledged that Ziegel &amp; apos ; s death was accidental .
WampireWampire is an American indie rock band from Portland , Oregon , started by duo Rocky Tinder and Eric Phipps .
The band has released 2 full-length albums on Polyvinyl Records ; their debut album &amp; quot ; Curiosity &amp; quot ; ( released on May 13 , 2013 ) and the follow-up &amp; quot ; Bazaar &amp; quot ; ( released on October 7 , 2014 ) . Wampire formed in 2007 , though Phipps and Tinder had been playing together since 2001 .
The duo become well known in the Portland house show scene for their dance-oriented electronic music .
After a shift in musical direction to create a more diversified sound , the band began recording their debut album &amp; quot ; Curiosity &amp; quot ; in late 2012 .
The album was produced by Jake Portrait from fellow Portland band Unknown Mortal Orchestra and released by Polyvinyl Records on May 13 , 2013 .
The album was well received by critics , with positive reviews from &amp; quot ; Paste &amp; quot ; , Pitchfork , Allmusic , Consequence of Sound , and other outlets . Following the release of their debut album Curiosity in 2013 , Wampire went from a duo most accustomed to playing house parties around their hometown of Portland to a five-piece band performing in venues all over the world with groups such as Unknown Mortal Orchestra , Foxygen , and Smith Westerns . That 12-month span saw Wampire play more shows in more cities , countries , and continents than in all their previous years together combined — a nearly non-stop barrage of new and memorable experiences that , above all else , forced the band members to become more fully immersed in music than at any other time in their lives . As a result , when founding members and primary songwriters Rocky Tinder and Eric Phipps returned home at the tail end of the year , they immediately dove into the process of working on a new album in order to capitalize on the creative energy that had been steadily amassing during their days , weeks , and months on the road . Says Phipps of that moment in time , &amp; quot ; I holed up in a tiny room within a friend &amp; apos ; s warehouse and began knocking out as many different songs as I could .
I tried not to look back , just wanting to explore everything I could possibly create .
I started to feel like I was becoming a Kafka-esque insomniac musical novelist at one point . &amp; quot ; As with their previous full-length Curiosity , Wampire recorded Bazaar with trusted producer Jacob Portrait ( of Unknown Mortal Orchestra ) , though this time around the sessions took place at The Museum , a studio in Brooklyn &amp; apos ; s Greenpoint neighborhood , and were done directly to tape . Far from home once again , Tinder and Phipps used the city to their advantage — writing lyrics on the 40-minute bus ride to and from their temporary residence in Bed-Stuy and rushing to a shop down the street to buy a guitar — one that looked and felt like it had been buried in dust for decades and had just the right analog sound — as their allotted studio time was winding down . Another important change was the addition of touring drummer Thomas Hoganson to the recording and songwriting process .
Though Tinder and Phipps had previously sought to minimize distractions in the studio by just working with each other , Hoganson &amp; apos ; s diverse musical abilities ( in addition to drums , he also plays piano and saxophone on Bazaar ) made him an ideal collaborator .
Fred LockleyFred Lockley ( March 19 , 1871 – October 15 , 1958 ) was an American journalist best known for his editorial column for the &amp; quot ; Oregon Journal &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Impressions and Observations of a Journal Man &amp; quot ; , which appeared throughout the Western United States on a nearly daily basis .
Lockley also authored many books which , like his articles , were largely about his travels and interviews with early settlers in the Willamette Valley .
It was said that he interviewed &amp; quot ; bullwhackers , muleskinners , pioneers , prospectors , 49ers , Indian fighters , trappers , ex-barkeepers , authors , preachers , poets and near-poets &amp; quot ; .
He also interviewed Thomas Edison , Booker T .
Washington , Ezra Meeker , Woodrow Wilson , Count Tolstoy , General Hugh Scott and Jack London . Lockley was born in Leavenworth , Kansas to English immigrant , Civil War Veteran and newspaper editor Frederic Lockley and Elizabeth Campbell on March 19 , 1871 .
The following year the family moved to Salt Lake City where , along with business partners George F .
Prescott and A .
M .
Hamilton , Frederic Lockley bought and ran the &amp; quot ; Salt Lake City Tribune &amp; quot ; , working for seven years as the managing editor . From there , the family took a wagon west to Walla Walla , Washington .
Fred Lockley later wrote , &amp; quot ; The odor of sagebrush today brings back vividly our evening campfires made of sagebrush , and the ever present coyotes with their mournful howl .
Once more I can see the stagecoach sweep by with its four horses , traveling at full speed -- I can see too , the long lines of freight wagons and Indians .
Here and there along the trail were the bleaching bones of oxen -- a grim reminder of the hardships of the Old Oregon Trail . &amp; quot ; One year later the family moved to Butte , Montana where Frederic became the first editor of the &amp; quot ; Butte Inter-Mountain &amp; quot ; .
It was for the Inter-Mountain that young Fred Lockley got his start in the newspaper business , as a carrier for the paper . After four years the family moved to what is now Oklahoma , then called the Cherokee Strip , settling on the Ponca reservation .
There young Fred Lockley met Chief Joseph while the former chief of the Nez Perce was held as a prisoner of war . From Oklahoma the family moved to Albany , New York as Fredric Lockley toured the eastern and mid-western United States as a lecturer .
Fredric Lockley soon returned to the newspaper business , purchasing the &amp; quot ; Arkansas City Traveler &amp; quot ; .
Here , young Fred continued his profession , working as an office boy and type sorter for his father . In 1888 , Fred Lockley moved to Salem , Oregon .
He was hired by the &amp; quot ; Capital Journal &amp; quot ; as compositor by W .
H .
Byars , the surveyor general of Oregon from 1890 to 1894 .
Before long Byars began devoting a greater amount of time to his surveying and less to the paper , promoting Lockley to the position of business manager and editor for the paper .
Lockley entered into the Oregon Agricultural College , now Oregon State University , from 1889 to 1890 , and later received a degree in education from Willamette University in 1895 . For a year Lockley worked on a farm in Polk County , Oregon followed by work writing for the &amp; quot ; Salem Statesman &amp; quot ; and as field editor for &amp; quot ; Pacific Homestead &amp; quot ; .
This took him on horseback across the Pacific Northwest , where he crossed paths with farmers , miners , hunters and pioneers .
During these trips Lockley began gathering stories and writing articles on pioneer men and women .
Lockley also worked for the federal government in the following years , assisting in geological surveys in what is now Glacier National Park .
He then worked as a carrier for the Salem post office , and by 1900 made his way to Nome , Alaska .
In Nome Lockley worked as a miner and also for the local &amp; quot ; Nome Nugget &amp; quot ; .
While in Nome , with the help of Ben Taylor , who had also worked for the Salem post office , Lockley established the first free mail delivery to Nome . Upon the urging of his wife , Lockley moved to Pendleton , Oregon , in 1901 , where he bought a 25 % interest in the &amp; quot ; Daily East Oregonian &amp; quot ; .
After four years he left to become general manager of the magazine &amp; quot ; The Pacific Monthly &amp; quot ; , which merged with &amp; quot ; Sunset &amp; quot ; in 1911 when the magazine was bought by the Southern Pacific Railroad .
Lockley moved to the publication that would make his reputation , the &amp; quot ; Oregon Journal &amp; quot ; , in Portland , Oregon . It was while writing for the &amp; quot ; Oregon Journal &amp; quot ; that Lockley began his nearly daily column , &amp; quot ; Thoughts and Observations of a Journal Man &amp; quot ; , or as it was shortened for his nickname , &amp; quot ; The Journal Man &amp; quot ; .
He spent a short time as a World War I correspondent for the &amp; quot ; Oregon Journal &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; New York Herald &amp; quot ; , and the &amp; quot ; London Globe &amp; quot ; , during which time he also built huts and dig trenches for the combined Allied forces , sometimes under heavy fire .
He filed 347 war articles . While Lockley wrote for the &amp; quot ; Oregon Journal &amp; quot ; for several years , his output tapered off as he spent more time on his books and with his family .
His books included &amp; quot ; Oregon Folks &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Oregon &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Yesterdays &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Oregon Trail Blazers &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Across the Plains by Prairie Schooner &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Vigilante Days in Virginia City &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; Vigilante Days in Carson City &amp; quot ; . On June 16 , 1897 Fred Lockley married his first wife , Hope Gans .
It was Hope who convinced Fred to leave the government postal work and invest in the &amp; quot ; Daily East Oregonian &amp; quot ; .
They had three children .
Frederic Llewellyn and Hope both died in their youth .
Lawrence Campbell Lockley lived to fight in World War I and graduate from the University of California , with a doctorate from Harvard .
He went on to teach at University of Southern California and Santa Clara University . In 1928 , Hope Gans Lockley died and was buried in Portland , Oregon , next to their daughter .
Two years later Lockley married Laura Simpson .
Fred Lockley died October 15 , 1958 .
After Lockley &amp; apos ; s death Mike Helm , an Oregon native and author , compiled portions of Lockley &amp; apos ; s extensive unpublished notebooks into several new books including &amp; quot ; Conversations with Pioneer Men &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Conversations with Pioneer Women &amp; quot ; .
These collections are used as primary reference on Oregon history and pioneers of the Northwest .

McLaughlin MoundThe McLaughlin Mound is a Native American mound in the central part of the U . S .
state of Ohio .
Located near the city of Mount Vernon in Knox County , it is an important archaeological site . McLaughlin measures approximately high and in diameter .
Located on a hill with an elevation of , it is typical of burial mounds constructed by people of the Adena culture .
Although the date of work is uncertain , it is known to have been excavated at some point in the past ; those digging into the mound discovered burned bones in the course of their work .
Such a discovery is typical of Adena mounds : the Adena frequently placed bodies within wooden buildings that were ceremonially burned , after which they constructed mounds atop the site .
As a result , it is likely that a comprehensive excavation of the mound would discover features such as postholes ; excavations of similar mounds located along Alum Creek to the west revealed the remains of houses and cremated bodies . In 1972 , the McLaughlin Mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological significance ; it is one of three Knox County mounds on the Register , along with the Raleigh and Stackhouse Mounds near Fredericktown to the northwest .
Key to its designation was its potential to reveal further information about its builders , as post-excavation analysis of any artifacts found within the mound might give archaeologists a substantially clearer understanding of the population movements and cultural developments of the Adena people in central Ohio .

Yumiko-chan incidentThe Yumiko-chan incident refers to the rape and murder of a six-year-old girl named Yumiko Nagayama ( sometimes reported as Yumiko Arakaki ) by a 31-year-old American soldier stationed in Okinawa , that took place September 3 , 1955 , ten years into the U . S .
occupation of Okinawa , which at that time was not part of Japan .
It was noticed at about 8 p . m that she was missing , when she didn &amp; apos ; t come home from playing outdoors . The next day , her body was found in a military garbage dump on the Kadena Air Base .
She had been raped and murdered , and her body looked as if it had &amp; quot ; been cut up with a sharp knife from the abdominal region to the bowel &amp; quot ; .
An indictment was submitted against Sergeant Isaac J .
Hurt ( sometimes incorrectly reported as Isaac J .
Hart ) of B Battalion , 32nd Artillery Division , on charges of murder , rape and kidnapping .
Anger against the U . S .
military occupation of Okinawa increased due to the incident , and the fact that due to extraterritoriality laws , the alleged rapist-murderer would not undergo an Okinawan trial , but rather a U . S .
military court martial .
From the end of the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 until 1972 , Okinawa was governed by the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands . A Rally for Protection of Children was held in Okinawa and the Association for Protection of Children was formed with this incident , and many Okinawans rallied in support of the cause .
Okinawans demanded that the U . S .
military &amp; quot ; Punish offenders of this kind of case with the death penalty without leniency regardless of nationality or ethnicity . &amp; quot ; Okinawans demanded that he be tried in a civilian court and that the trial be broadcast — requests that were declined . Isaac J .
Hurt was brought up on charges of rape and murder by a U . S .
court-martial in Okinawa .
His court martial lasted 13 days , during which time he insisted upon his innocence .
He was convicted after a deliberation of less than an hour , and sentenced to death .
His was the second conviction of a U . S .
serviceman on Okinawa for rape in less than a month .
Though he was initially sentenced to death by a US court martial , Hurt returned to the US without the Okinawan public being informed .
His sentence was eventually reduced to 45 years . The incident led to further debate over the continued presence of U . S .
forces in Japan , and was the springboard for the first serious , coordinated anti-U . S .
military protests in Okinawa following the beginning of the occupation .

The property also contains the Gregory Family cemetery , the historic elk pasture created by James Bellwood , and two feeding stations for the elk .
In 1887 , the house and farmlands were acquired by James Bellwood , who restored the depleted land and made the farm one of Virginia &amp; apos ; s chief agricultural showplaces .
In 1941 , the Bellwood property was acquired by the U . S .
Government and used for the Department of Defense General Supply Center .
The house is maintained as the center &amp; apos ; s officers &amp; apos ; club . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 .

Kiprijan RačaninKiprijan Račanin ( , &amp; quot ; Cyprian of Rača &amp; quot ; ; c .
1650 – 1730 ) was a Serbian writer and monk who founded a copyist school ( Scriptorium ) in Szentendre , just like the one he left behind in Serbia at the commencement of the Great Turkish War in 1689 . It was , incidentally , in the small wooden church , dedicated to the Evangelist Luke , that the Szentenedre Scriptorium and printing office came into being ; among the monk-scribes Kiprijan Račanin , Gavrilo Trojičanin , Jerotej Račanin , Čirjak Račanin , Hristifor Račanin , Teodor Račanin , and Gavril Stefanović Venclović , Kiprijan &amp; apos ; s student , were especially well-known . Very little is known about him .
He was very humble and would not reveal his true identity — Kiprijan is an adopted ecclesiastical name that he assumed when he entered the monastic cloister .
When he writes he is self-defacing and even demeaning to himself : &amp; quot ; great sinner &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; useless &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; narrow-minded &amp; quot ; ; and &amp; quot ; mad &amp; quot ; .
He even hides his origin and place of birth : &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; otečestvo mi zemlja , mati že grob &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; , my paternity &amp; apos ; s my land ; mother &amp; apos ; s my grave . We know , however , that he took orders at the Rača monastery and became a monk-scribe .
During the Great Turkish War of 1689-1699 he left central Serbia for Serbian territories up north , bordering Hungary .
In Zenta he remained for a while , joining the Christian frey against the Turks in the Battle of Zenta .
With Arsenije III Čarnojević he came to settle in Szentendre , where he began to make a name for himself as the dean of a scriptorium , a diligent copyist of manuscripts and books , and writer of the first Serbian primer called &amp; quot ; Bukvar &amp; quot ; in 1717 , an adaptation of a Primer by Russian writer Fedor Polikarpov-Orlov ( 1660-1731 ) .

Lands of WillowyardThe ancient lands of Willowyard , Willieyeards , Williyard or Willizeards were part of the holdings of the Regality of Kilwinning , Barony of Beith , and Bailiary of Cuninghame .
They later became the property of the Montgomerie family before being sold to the Simson family in 1723 .
The manor house still survives as part of a business premises and the nearby industrial estate and whisky bond carry the name &amp; apos ; Willowyards &amp; apos ; . On the eastern side of Kilbirnie Loch lie the ancient lands of Willowyard , locally pronounced &amp; apos ; Williyard &amp; apos ; , and the various &amp; apos ; Mains &amp; apos ; properties associated with it .
A parsonage and vicarage were once located on these &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; 20 / - lands of old extent &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; . These lands were passed to Helen , daughter of Robert Lord Boyd , &amp; quot ; in her pure , spotless , and inviolate virginity &amp; quot ; and were held by her for life , the feu for the property passing to the abbot and convent of Kilwinning .
Blaeu &amp; apos ; s map of Timothy Pont &amp; apos ; s survey marks the property as &amp; apos ; Williezeards &amp; apos ; .
In 1559 Hugh Montgomery of Hessilhead held the &amp; quot ; lands of old extent of Williyard , in the parish of Beith and regality of Kilwinning . &amp; quot ; The lands became the property of the Hon .
Francis Montgomerie of Giffin and then passed to his nephew , Alexander , 9th Earl of Eglinton . In 1723 Mr William Simson or Simpson obtained the property from the Earl .
in 1721 he married Barbara Barclay of Warrix and after she died , to Elizabeth Moore of Bruntwood in 1726 .
His first wife &amp; apos ; s father had been a Provost of Irvine .
He also had a third marriage in 1736 to Hannah Crochet or Crokat of Glasgow .
He had three daughters , Janet , Margaret and Elizabeth , together with a son William .
William Simson was said to be a man of expensive tastes and his son William was forced in 1772 to sell the estate to Mr John Ker of London .
By 1777 Mr Ker had sold the property to Mr John Neale or Neil of Edinburgh .
In 1804 John Neale sold the property to Mr Robert Steel of Port Glasgow with John and Robert Duncan recorded as tenants .
By 1833 William Wilson ( son of Janet Simson ) had purchased his ancestraal lands of Willowyards and his nephew , Alexander Shedden of Morishil later inherited . The surviving Willowyard House dates from 1727 in the form of 7271 is for some unrecorded reason carved on the exterior of the house .
Circa 1750 a William Simson is recorded as the owner .
By the end of the 18th century Willowyards was a well established farmstead and the Edinburgh Advertiser describes it as : &amp; quot ; consisting of about 175 English acres of arable land , well enclosed and subdivided into fifteen fields , and let by one lease to three substantial tenants for 19 years at £ 130 per annum .
Upon this property there is a good house , and garden stocked with fruit trees , a malt mill and an elegant court of offices newly erected .
A valuable flag and stone quarry has been opened in the ground and it is believed there are both coal and limestone in it .
There are about ten acres of wood and a good deal of timber on this farm ; and thriving belts of planting surround the greatest part of it &amp; quot ; . It is likely that William Simson built the surviving mansion house of two storeys and garrets in the early 1770s and when constructed it was one of the most luxurious habitations in the parish , set in picturesque surroundings .
It was approached by an avenue of tree planted during the time of the Montgomeries and a plantation of old trees also existed at the far end of the enclosure .
Three of these beech trees circumferences were measured in 1890 at 11 feet 4 inches , 10 feet and 9 feet , all two feet from the ground .
A once well laid out garden and orchard was present to the right and in front of Willowyard House , divided by the Willowyard Burn that runs from Braidinhill to its confluence with Kilbirnie Loch .
In 1893 Willowyard House was restored both inside and out , the roof also being replaced at this time .
The rubble walls of the mansion house were formerly harled and the window and angle margins left as exposed dressed stone ; the roof was originally thatched . The Willowyard House is currently utilized as an office building to the attached manufacturing facility for Chemtec UK Ltd . , a subsidiary of Armstrong-Chemtec Group .
Armstrong-Chemtec Group is an international engineering and manufacturing source for heat transfer equipment used around the world starting back in 1946 . In 1820 Willowyard is recorded as being an estate of 120 acres , well planted up by the owner with belts of plantings and the fine house situated in full view of the loch .
The estate sits on whinstone and a small quarry nearby became an ornamental lake .
In 1820 John Neil Esq of Edinburgh was the owner .
By 1822 the owner of Willowyard is recorded as Robert Steel or Steele , a Port Glasgow ironmaster and the lands were assessed as the 14th most valuable in the parish at £ 114 per year valued rent .
The 1827 map by Aitken marks the estate as being the property of Robert Steel Esq .
In the New Statistical Account , William Wilson , a maternal descendent of previous owners purchased the estate in 1832 and in 1839 Alexander Shedden is noted as the owner . In 1896 the farm steading , Willowyard Mains and later &amp; apos ; Main-Neil &amp; apos ; was detached from the mansion house and formed three sides of a square .
It was connected however by the high garden wall .
In 1891 the dairy accommodation was enlarged and other improvements made , water also being piped in from springs at Morishil . The lands named &amp; apos ; Mains &amp; apos ; became divided up into &amp; apos ; Mains-Neil &amp; apos ; as stated above and also &amp; apos ; Mains-Houston &amp; apos ; , and &amp; apos ; Mains-Marshal &amp; apos ; .
Robertson records that Mains-Hamilton was recently ( 1820 ) converted into a &amp; quot ; good looking house &amp; quot ; by Mr .
Dun , however it passed to a Mr .
Houston .
A farmhouse is shown marked as Mains-Hamilton on the OS map of 1856 together with an L-plan outbuilding , which may now form part of the former coachhouse at &amp; apos ; The Meadows &amp; apos ; on Arran Crescent .
The farmhouse was demolished and the villa built on the site , perhaps utilising the existing whinstone .
Blaeu &amp; apos ; s map of Timothy Pont &amp; apos ; s survey of circa 1600 marks the properties of Mains-Mure , Mainshill , and Mains-Neil , with Mains-Mure as a castleated tower house . The 1911 OS map refers to Mains Lodge as &amp; apos ; Muir Lodge &amp; apos ; after William Muir who built Mains House .
The Muir family owned the Bath Lane Tannery , near the Beith Health centre of today ( 2011 ) and built the Bark Mill .
William Muir of Mains joined John Muir and Sons , Tanners , Curriers , and Fancy Leather Manufacturers as a partner in 1846 .
Laigh Mains , also demolished , was the home farm of Mains House .
Dr McCusker , a GP based in Glasgow , owned Mains House at the time of WW2 , followed by Mr Dewar , prior to its purchase and demolition . Mid Road used to cross the Bath Burn by a ford near Mains House and then ran up to the town ; the road has now been abandoned and is only used by intrepid walkers . The Willowyard Industrial Estate is situated between Kilbirnie loch and the town of Beith .
Whisky Bonds were established here by Ballantyne Whisky Company in 1968 , following the disaster of the Cheapside Street Whisky Bond Fire .
Engraved stones with the initials of Mr and Mrs Muir on the Mains House and these were saved when Mains House was demolished circa 1975 and now form part of a garden within the grounds of the bonded area . As stated , Willowyard House still stands , converted into offices serving a heat transfer manufacturing company , Chemtec UK Ltd . , which is a subsidiary of Armstrong-Chemtec Group .
The main railway line from Ayr to Glasgow runs below the industrial estate and forms the eastern margin of the loch in places . An unusual industrial centre , a Bark Mill , most likely built by the Muirs of Mains House and powered by the combined Mains and Bath Burns existed on the old lands of Willowyard .
The mill produced fine ground oak bark for use in the Beith tanneries using bark from the old oak trees that once aforested the loch side .
Later the mill became a furniture factory run by Matthew Pollock who applied the use of machinery to help with the manufacture of furniture in 1858 .
The site was isolated and inconvenient for the workers and was eventually sold to Robert Balfour . The first wheeled horse-cart in the parish was used at Willowyard circa 1750 . Notes ; Sources and Bibliography ;

Crooswijk General CemeteryCrooswijk General Cemetery ( Algemene Begraafplaats Crooswijk ) is a cemetery in Rotterdam , the Netherlands . As in many countries , burial within city limits became illegal in Rotterdam in 1827 .
Crooswijk was taken into use in 1832 , although the cemetery had not been finished yet .
Due to the outbreak of a Cholera epidemic , burial space was needed quickly .
In 1915 a new entrance was taken into use .
The old entrance still exists . When the Walloon church was demolished in 1922 the contents of the graves were transferred to the cemetery and a memorial was put in place .
When the Laurenskerk was severely damaged by bombing in 1940 , many of the graves were also transferred to Crooswijk . The cemetery is laid out as a park .
The cemetery is a general ( non-denominational ) cemetery .
There are sections for casualties of wars , the resistance in the Second World War .
There is also a fast-growing Islamic section . Many of the trees symbolise grief such as Weeping Beech , Silver Birch ( Betula pendula var .
&amp; quot ; Tristis &amp; quot ; , which in Dutch is known as the Weeping Birch ) , Dutch Elm ( in Dutch known as Weeping Elm ) and Weeping Willow . The cemetery is a national heritage site ( Rijksmonument ) in the Netherlands , as are some of the buildings in the cemetery and are therefore protected . The cemetery is located in Crooswijk .
The new entrance is on Kerkhoflaan ( near the junction with Rusthoflaan ) . The cemetery is open daily .
A booklet containing a cultural route through the cemetery is available from the office located at the entrance ( also contains a map ) .
Mont Saint Michel AbbeyThe Mont Saint Michel Abbey is located within the city and island of Mont-Saint-Michel in Lower Normandy , in the department of Manche . The abbey is an essential part of the structural composition of the town the feudal society constructed .
On top , God , the abbey , and monastery ; below this , the Great halls , then stores and housing , and at the bottom ( outside the walls ) , fishermen &amp; apos ; s and farmers &amp; apos ; housing . The abbey has been protected as a French &amp; quot ; monument historique &amp; quot ; since 1862 .
Since 1979 , the site as a whole – i . e . , the Mont Saint-Michel and its bay – has been a UNESCO world heritage site and is managed by the &amp; quot ; Centre des monuments nationaux &amp; quot ; . With more than 1 . 335 million visitors in 2010 , the abbey is among the most visited cultural sites in France . The first text about an abbey is the 9th-century Latin text &amp; quot ; Revelatio ecclesiae sancti Michaelis in monte Tumba &amp; quot ; written by a &amp; quot ; chanoine &amp; quot ; living at Mont Saint Michel or at the &amp; quot ; Cathédrale Saint-André d &amp; apos ; Avranches &amp; quot ; .
This text was written at a time of power struggle between Brittany and the County of Normandy against Francia as well as during canon law reforms by Roman emperors . When Christianity expanded to the area , around the 4th century , Mont Tombe , the original name of Mont Saint Michel , was part of the Diocese of Avranches .
By the middle of the 6th century , Christianity had a stronger presence in the bay .
By this time , Mont Tombe was populated by religious devotees , hermits ( probably some Celtic monks ) supplied by the &amp; quot ; curé &amp; quot ; of Astériac , who took care of the site and led a contemplative life around some oratories .
The hermits Saint Pair and Saint Seubilion dedicated one of the oratories to Saint Étienne , midway through the mont and one to Saint Symphorien , at the foot of the rock . In 710 , Mont Tombe was renamed &amp; quot ; Mont Saint Michel au péril de la Mer &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; Mount Saint Michael at the peril of the sea ) after erecting an oratory to Saint Michael by bishop Saint Aubert of Avranches in 708 .
According to the legend , Aubert received , during his sleep , three times the order from Saint Michael to erect an oratory on the Mont Tombe .
The archangel was reputed to have left his finger mark on Aubert &amp; apos ; s skull .
This skull is displayed at the Saint-Gervais d &amp; apos ; Avranches basilica with such a scar on it . This sanctuary should be , according to the archangel , a replica of the Gargano in Italy ( from the 5th century ) .
Aubert had a local religious artifact removed and instead a circular sanctuary built , made of dry stones .
Around 708 , Aubert sent two monks to get some artifacts from the Italian sanctuary Gargano ( a rock with his foot print and a piece of tissue from the altar ) .
During this mission , the March 709 tsunami is supposed to have destroyed the Scissy forest and turned the Mont into an island .
On October 16 709 , the bishop dedicated the church and put twelve chanoine there .
The Mont-Saint-Michel was born . The remains of the oratory were found in the chapel Notre-Dame-Sous-Terre .
This sanctuary contained the tomb of Aubert and most likely the artifacts brought from Gargano .
The chapel Notre-Dame-Sous-Terre is today under the nave of the abbey-church . The first buildings became too small and under the Western Roman Empire multiple buildings were added .
Charlemagne chose saint Michel as a protector of his empire during the 9th century and tried to have the place renamed &amp; quot ; Mont-Saint-Michel &amp; quot ; , but during the Middle Ages it was usually called &amp; quot ; Saint-Michel-aux-Deux-Tombes &amp; quot ; ( Saint Michel with two tombs ) ( Mons Sancti Michaelis in periculo maris , in reference to Tombelaine ) . The Mont-Saint-Michel monks , during the first century of their institution , venerated the archangel Michael .
The Mont became a place of prayer and study , but the stability period , known as the &amp; quot ; Neustria &amp; quot ; , during the reign of Charlemagne ended when he died .
As the rest of Gaule was fighting invasions , religion and science found some welcoming in the diocese of Avranches and at the Mont-Saint-Michel . At first , pilgrims kept coming to the Mont .
After the Vikings captured the Mont in 847 , the monks departed .
But , as an island , it offered some protection for the local population and thus never stayed empty . After the signature of the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte , Rollo ( Gange-Hrólfr &amp; quot ; Rollo &amp; quot ; Ragnvaldsson de Normandie ) started repairing the damages inflicted to the religious buildings .
He generously financed the Mont and called back the monks displaced by the war , returning the Mont to its previous condition . The wealth and support that the Mont suddenly obtained from Rollo started to fundamentally affect its inhabitants , taking them away from their solitary , religious life .
After William I of Normandy took over his father &amp; apos ; s title as Duke of Normandy in 927 , he expanded his support toward monasteries until his assassination in 932 ; but his wealth , from which they benefited , further exacerbated their mundane life style .
Because of their generous contributions to the Mont , the Dukes of Brittany Conan 1st , who died in 992 , and Geoffrey 1st , who died in 1008 , were buried in the Mont as benefactors . The rapid growth of wealth of the church-abbey Saint-Michel became an obstacle to its function and nature .
The religious used their wealth , coming from the piety of the rich surrounding princes , to satisfy their pleasures .
Local nobles tried to obtain the favors of the Mont &amp; apos ; s religious inhabitants to spend it on meals , travels , and hunting in their company , which became their main occupation . When Richard 1st , son of William 1st , became duke of Normandy , he tried , using his authority , to return them to a more monastic life .
After failing to do so , and with the approbation of pope John XIII and king Lothair , he decided to replace them with a monastery of the Benedict order , as mentioned in &amp; quot ; Introductio monachorum &amp; quot ; ( « the installation of the monks » ) , a treaty written around 1080-1095 by a Mont-Saint-Michel monk trying to defend the independence of the monastery toward the state . After getting the approval from the local warlords and religious of the Norman abbeys , the monastery of Saint-Wandrille , Saint-Taurin-d ’ Évreux and Jumièges , Duke Richard I sent an officer and some soldiers to the Mont Saint Michel to announce his order : return to a religious life style and become a member of the Benedict order or leave the Mont .
Only one accepted and all the others left , leaing the abbot Maynard 1st , coming from Saint-Wandrille abbey , to establish a Benedict ruling .
The installation of the Benedict monks took place in 966 , which is marked as the founding year of the Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey .
Those monks added the double nave pre-roman church &amp; quot ; Notre-Dame-sous-Terre &amp; quot ; . William de Volpiano , the Italian architect who had built the Abbey of Fécamp in Normandy , was chosen by Richard II of Normandy to build the church of the abbey in 1060 .
He designed the Romanesque church of the abbey , placing the transept crossing at the top of the mount .
Many underground crypts and chapels had to be built to compensate for this weight , forming the basis for the supportive upward structure that can be seen today . The Mont-Saint-Michel was at its apex during the 1100s , with the abbot of Torigni , private counsel of the Duke of Normandy , Henry II of England , reinforcing the structure of the buildings , and building the main facade of the church . In 1204 , France &amp; apos ; s King Philippe-Auguste started to take over the fiefs of Duke of Normandy John Lackland .
His ally , Guy of Thouars , Duke of Brittany , undertook the siege of the Mont-Saint-Michel .
After having set fire to the village and massacring the population , he failed to conquer the abbey , protected by stone fortifications .
But the fire from the village extended to the abbey and damaged it significantly . Horrified by the exaction of his Brittany ally , Philippe-Auguste offered abbot Jourdain a grant for the construction of a new Gothic-style architectural set , which included the addition of the refectory and cloister .
The &amp; quot ; Merveille &amp; quot ; , built in medieval Norman style , with a circular capital , some spandrels in Caen stone and some plant motifs , was completed in 1228 . Charles VI is credited with adding major fortifications to the abbey , building towers and successive courtyards , and strengthening the ramparts . When Louis XI of France founded the Order of Saint Michael in 1469 , he intended that the abbey church of Mont Saint-Michel become the chapel for the Order , but because of its great distance from Paris , his intention could never be realized . Even as some oubliettes have been mentioned since the 11th century , the abbey started to be used more regularly as a jail during the Ancien Régime , becoming a state jail during Louis XI &amp; apos ; s reign . Mont Saint Michel &amp; apos ; s popularity and prestige as a center of pilgrimage waned with the Reformation , and by the time of the French Revolution there were scarcely any monks in residence .
The abbey was closed in 1791 and converted into a prison , initially to hold clerical opponents of the republican regime ( up to 300 priests at one point ) .
The abbey was then nicknamed « bastille des mers » ( Bastille of the sea ) . In 1794 , an optical telegraph system , designed by Claude Chappe , was installed on top of the dome , making the Mont-Saint-Michel part of the Paris-Brest telegraph line .
In 1817 , the numerous modifications of the structure by the prison administration led to the collapse of the hostelry built under Robert de Torigni . During Louis-Philippe d &amp; apos ; Orléans , some prisoners started a protest that led to the replacement of the prison director , Martin des Landes .
Thanks to a corrupt system , the richest prisoners could visit the Mont Saint Michel town , others could borrow books from the monks &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; scriptorium &amp; quot ; . Up to 700 prisoners worked in a workshop set up in the abbey , making straw hats , which started a fire in 1834 and partially damaged it . After some higher profile political prisoners were held there , such as Victor Dubourg de La Cassagne , Desforges , Martin Bernard , Armand Barbès and Auguste Blanqui , some influential figures , including Victor Hugo , launched a campaign to restore what was seen as a national architectural treasure that led to its closure by Napoleon III in 1863 .
The 650 prisoners were transferred to other prisons . The prison was finally closed in 1863 and the abbey was rented by the bishop of Coutances starting that same year , until it was declared a monument historique in 1874 . In 1835 , Viollet-le-Duc visited the Mont and later his students , Paul Gout and Édouard Corroyer ( the famous Mère Poulard was his maid ) , were commissioned to restore it .
Urgent work to consolidate and restore the abbey was conducted by Édouard Corroyer .
In 1896 , a neogothic spire , rising 170 meters above the sea level , was added . The archangel Saint Michel at top of the spire ( completed in 1898 ) was started in 1895 by the sculptor Emmanuel Frémiet at the &amp; quot ; ateliers Monduit &amp; quot ; that previously did some work for Viollet-le-Duc . In 1898 , during some excavation under the floor of the church , Paul Gout discovered the Notre-Dame-Sous-Terre .
It was completely excavated in 1959 , after architect Yves-Marie Froidevaux had a concrete beam installed . Mont Saint Michel as a whole and its bay were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1979 , and it was listed with criteria such as cultural , historical , and architectural significance , as well as human-created and natural beauty . Starting in 1922 , Christian worship was again practiced in the abbey . In 1966 , with the celebration of the abbey &amp; apos ; s first millennium , a few Benedictine monasteries sent monks to spend the summer there .
At the end of the summer a few stayed , led by Bruno de Senneville , from Bec Abbey , with the approval of the state , owner of the place .
They slowly started to leave after 1979 . Since 2001 , the Benedictine monks have been replaced by some from the Monastic Fraternities of Jerusalem , originally from Saint-Gervais &amp; apos ; Church in Paris . Started during the 10th century , the Benedictine abbey has numerous architectural marvels from West Roman empire , roman and Gothic styles .
The Mont-Saint-Michel could , in that sense , be considered a megastructure where the buildings are on top of each other while trying to accommodate Benedict activities within a tight space . The abbey can be divided in multiple parts : The original church-abbey was founded in 966 but later completely covered by the multiple expansions of the abbey and was then forgotten for many centuries .
These parts of the abbey were rediscovered near the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century .
It has since been restored and offers a beautiful example of pre-roman architecture . The other church-abbey buildings were erected to the East of the original church , on top of the rock and above the church itself . As more pilgrims came to the Mont Saint Michel , it was decided to expand the abbey by building a new abbey church at the site of the monks &amp; apos ; quarters , which was moved to the north of Notre-Dame-Sous-Terre . The new church-abbey first had three crypts built : the Trente-Cierges chapel ( under the North wing ) , the choir crypt ( to the East ) and Saint-Martin chapel ( under the South wing ) ( 1031-1047 ) .
Then Abbot Ranulphe started the construction of the nave in 1060 .
In 1080 , three levels were built to the North of Notre-Dame-Sous-Terre , including the &amp; quot ; salle de l ’ Aquilon &amp; quot ; , which served as chaplaincy to host pilgrims , the monk promenade and a dormitory .
The wine cellar and chaplaincy for the future &amp; quot ; Merveille &amp; quot ; were also started . By then the new buildings fully covered Notre-Dame-Sous-Terre which was still used for religious activities . ReconstructionsBadly built , three spans on the West side of the nave collapsed in 1103 .
Abbot Roger II had them rebuilt in 1115-1125 .
In 1421 the Romanesque choir collapsed .
It was rebuilt in Flamboyant-Gothic style from 1446 to 1523 ( with a construction break from 1450 to 1499 ) . The classic front of the abbey-churchAfter a fire in 1776 it was decided to destroy the three western spans of the nave and , in 1780 , the current Neo-Classic front was built .
The foundations to support it led to the split in two of Notre-Dame-Sous-Terre . The Mont-Saint-Michel abbey is divided in two parts : the church-abbey and the &amp; quot ; Merveille &amp; quot ; .
The &amp; quot ; Merveille &amp; quot ; was the monk living area .
Seen from outside , it has a gothic front , on the North side , has three levels and was built over 25 years . The &amp; quot ; Merveille &amp; quot ; can be subdivided into two parts : the East and the West sides .
The East side was built first ( from 1211 to 1218 ) and has three rooms : the chaplaincy , the hosts room and the dining-hall ( from bottom to top ) .
The West side was built seven years later and has three rooms : the wine cellar , the Knights room and the cloister . From 1154 to 1164 the abbot Robert of Torigni had a set of buildings added to the West and South-west of the abbey containing lodgings for : the officiality , a new hostelry , an infirmary and the Saint-Étienne chapel .
He also modified the access ways to Notre-Dame-Sous-Terre , to prevent too many contacts between monks and pilgrims . There is also a treadwheel crane which served as a windlass , installed during the use of the site as a prison , to bring supplies to the prisoners .
Some prisoners would walk inside the wheel to rotate it . In the remain of the infirmary , that collapsed in 1811 , is a mural representation above the door of the three dead kings , showing three noble men caught in a cemetery by three dead , illustrating how short life is . The &amp; quot ; Merveille &amp; quot ; , located to the North of the church-abbey , contains a cloister , a dining-hall , a study room and a chaplaincy with an ideal floor plan for going from one to the other . The local geography played a major role in the design of the &amp; quot ; Merveille &amp; quot ; .
The lower most level , the wine cellar , was constructed with thick robust walls to support the floors above .
The distinctive , regularly spaced abutments on the Merveille &amp; apos ; s outer walls reach all the way to the top to reinforce the structure against any lateral forces imposed by the great weight of its towering upper levels . The chaplaincy was built during abbot Roger II leadership , when Abbot Raoul des iles lead the construction of the hosts room ( 1215-1217 ) , the dining-hall ( 1217-1220 ) the cellar , the knights room ( 1220-1225 ) and the cloister ( 1225-1228 ) . Contrary to the tradition , this cloister was not built at the center of the monastery , and thus does not link with all the other buildings .
Its function was purely spiritual : to bring the monks to meditate . Three arches of the cloister are opened to the sea or to the outside .
Those openings were the entryway to the chapter house that was never built .
The columns , arranged in quincunx , were originally made of limestone from England but were later restored using puddingstone from Lucerne . The cloister has in the middle a medieval garden recreated in 1966 by brother Bruno de Senneville , a Benedictine monk .
The center is made of box tree surrounded by 13 Damascus roses .
The squares of medicinal plants , aromatic herbs and flowers symbolize the daily needs of Middle age monks .
In the middle of the box trees were monsters to remind that in the middle of any marvel evil could still be there . The &amp; quot ; Belle Chaise &amp; quot ; building and the lodging wing hosted the administrative section of the abbey .
Abbot Richard Turstin built , on the East side , the Guards room ( that became the abbey entrance ) and a new officiality , where judicial decisions were made ( 1257 ) . Around 1393 , the two Châtelet towers were built , then the Perrine tower and a &amp; quot ; Bailliverie &amp; quot ; .
Later , under abbot Pierre Le Roy , a lodging wing was added , adding at the same time to the abbey fortifications . A fortified wall surround the city , located on the South and East side of the mont .
Two bombards , left by the English during the Hundred Years &amp; apos ; War are visible near one of the fortification door .

Vortex Flash HiderThe Vortex Flash Hider or Vortex Flash Eliminator is a flash suppressor made by Smith Enterprise , Inc .
for a variety of different rifles , carbines , machine guns and handguns . The Vortex Flash Hider was developed in 1984 , and a patent was secured in 1995 .
Sonja Sommers and Ron Smith of SEI developed the Vortex Flash Hider that incorporates a 5- , 10- and 15-degree twisted helix design , which eliminates up to 99 % of visible muzzle flash .
The Vortex is somewhat reminiscent of the original &amp; quot ; three-prong flash hider &amp; quot ; found on the original Vietnam-era M16 .
However , the Vortex is more robust and makes use of four solid tines , which are four equally spaced and angled 6 ° from a centerline of the body .
The Vortex is the only flash suppressor in the world with a helical flute design that breaks up the flash at multiple locations and angles .
SEI makes the Vortex for M16s , AR-15s , M14s , Steyr AUGs and certain pistols such as the Heckler &amp; amp ; Koch USP Tactical Model . The Vortex Flash Hider made for AR-15 type rifles weighs 3 ounces , is 2 . 25 inches in length and does not require a lock washer for attachment to the barrel of an AR-15 .
The use of a lock washer or crush washer was rejected as their use can increase visible flash from the shooter &amp; apos ; s perspective .
The Vortex is tightened by hand and repeated firing of the rifle causes the Vortex to tighten to the barrel . The Vortex Flash Hider has been called the &amp; quot ; most effective flash hider available short of a ( sound ) suppressor &amp; quot ; by writer and gunsmith Patrick Sweeney , when used on an AR-15 .
In a 2005 article appearing in &amp; quot ; SWAT &amp; quot ; magazine it was deemed to be superior to the M16A2 &amp; quot ; bird cage &amp; quot ; flash suppressor and the Yankee Hill Machine Phantom Flash Suppressor .
Peter G .
Kokalis of &amp; quot ; Soldier of Fortune &amp; quot ; magazine and &amp; quot ; Shotgun News &amp; quot ; wrote that he installed over 300 Vortex Flash hiders while working as a military advisor with a Central American paramilitary unit in the 1980s . The Vortex Flash Hider is used by the US Military on M4 carbines and M16 rifles with the NATO Stock Number of NSN 1005-01-591-5825 , PN 1001V . The Vortex Flash Hider has been used on the US Army &amp; apos ; s SOCCOM M14 rifle as the SEI 2000V and was chosen because it reduces visible flash by 99 % .
Installation of the SEI 2000V requires removal of the factory front sight and shooters in need of a front sight for their rifle can replace the rifle &amp; apos ; s gas block with a unit from Smith that includes an attached front sight post .
The Crazy Horse rifle and the Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle ( both made by SEI ) utilize the M14 Vortex as well and the Wind Talker sound suppressor and its predecessor , the M14 Direct Connect , were designed to fit over the Vortex in a direct connect fashion . In 2011 Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division adopted the Vortex Flash Hider for use on 50 caliber machine guns and rifles after it was rated the number one suppressor in their test report .
The testing performed by CRANE showed that the Vortex maintained a 95 % flash reduction threshold through 10,000 rounds of machine gun fire and was proven to not adversely affect normal combat functions , weapon firing or cycling , or interfere with mechanical sights .
The US Military &amp; apos ; s NATO Stock Number for this flash hider is NSN 1005-01-603-1401 , PN 6021 . Smith Enterprise manufactures the Vortex for a variety of other rifles such as the AK-47 , HK91 , Steyr Aug , FN-FAL and Galil .
Additionally , the company makes flash suppressors for installation on the M240 machine gun and M249 SAW with the NATO Stock Number 1005-01-600-857 , PN 1041V .
Vortex Flash Hiders can be installed on traditional bolt-action rifles and rifles such as the Ruger 10 / 22 , Ruger Mini-14 and Ruger Mini-30 , if the barrel is cut for the appropriate threads .

Cross-cultural differences in decision-makingDecision-making is a mental activity which is an integral part of planning and action taking in a variety of contexts and at a vast range of levels , including , but not limited to , budget planning , education planning , policy making , and climbing the career ladder .
People all over the world engage in these activities .
The underlying cross-cultural differences in decision-making can be a great contributing factor to efficiency in cross-cultural communications , negotiations , and conflict resolution . A considerable amount of literature in cognitive science has been devoted to the investigation of the nature of human decision-making .
However , a large portion of it discusses the results obtained from a unicultural subject pool , predominantly from a pool of American undergraduate students .
Notwithstanding this limitation , the results are usually implicitly or explicitly generalized , which gives rise to the home-field disadvantage : when a particular cultural group is taken as a starting point , it becomes much harder for the researches to notice , or to &amp; apos ; mark &amp; apos ; , the peculiarities existing within the group .
As a result , what is characteristic only of the group under study is taken for granted and ascribed to the general population .
This tendency is further aggravated when the researcher belongs to the cultural group that they study .
In this case , the researcher and the subjects are exposed to the same physical , social , and situational contexts on the daily basis .
Much of every-day functioning is automatic , in other words it is driven by the current features of the environment we are in , that are processed without any conscious awareness .
This leads to the building of implicit attitude , values , and beliefs , which are hard to spot .
They become apparent when individuals or decision-making models from different cultural backgrounds as different culture backgrounds tend to form different mind processing into decision making .
For example , westerners tend to form affective proccessing while easteners are tend to form analytical processing .
Moreover Affective or feeling based decision- makings tend to be faster and done spontaneously whereas cognitive or reason based decision making tends to be deliberateMore scientists have recently been becoming involved in conducting studies on decision-making across cultures .
The results show that there are in fact cross-cultural differences in behavior in general and in decision-making strategies in particular and thus impel researches to explain their origin .
There are a number of most popular and accepted explanations : Co-Evolution of Genes with Culture Hypothesis .
The planet Earth is rich in a variety of geographical zones , all of them differing from one another in climate and living conditions they allow for .
Across generations individuals populating a certain area learn to adopt and pass on to the next generations the cultural traits that promote survival and flourishing within the environment of their locality .
As a result , the genes supporting the survival-relevant traits are passed on , while others fade away .
In the long run , it becomes the case that it is for the surviving genes to set conditions for the cultural practices to be used and even to create the environment to which the members adapt .
The process that changes the frequency of application of cultural traits is influenced by the same forces that determine the remolding of the combination of genetic variants .
These forces are natural selection , mutation , drift , and migration .
There is however one more force – &amp; apos ; a decision-making force &amp; apos ; – in cultural evolution .
Since cultural traits are transmitted in the context of interpersonal communication , the cultural variants its participants adopt are influenced by the behavioral choices the &amp; apos ; communicator &amp; apos ; and the &amp; apos ; learner &amp; apos ; make . Cultural Heritage Hypothesis .
Cultural groups all over the world have developed distinct unique worldviews reflected in their philosophies .
The two most often compared are the Eastern philosophy which stems from the Confucian thought and the Western philosophy which is grounded in the Aristotelian thought .
While the former sees a part / whole dichotomy relations between the items , with special focus on the relations between the elements of nature rather than on the elements themselves , the latter pays more attention to a one / many dichotomy , where each element is seen as more or less autonomous .
These differences are deeply rooted in the collective unconscious and might be accountable for the diversity of individuals &amp; apos ; everyday behavior . Social Orientation Hypothesis .
All currently existing cultures can be compared with one another against the Collectivism / Individualism scale .
The societies that are usually described as individualistic have the independent social orientation .
The differentiating characteristics of those groups are autonomy , self-expression , and the interpretation of happiness as a socially disengaging emotion .
The collectivists &amp; apos ; societies have the interdependent social orientation .
Their members endorse harmony , relatedness , and connection , don &amp; apos ; t view themselves as bounded or separated from others , and experience happiness as a sense of closeness to others .
Typically interdependent societies are found among Eastern nations , and independent societies are found among Western nations .
Subgroups within a nation can also be compared against Independency / Interdependency scale .
For example , the working class in the U . S .
tends to be more interdependent compared with the middle class .
Numerous factors , such as geographical mobility , industrialization , and political systems , affect the social orientation . Depending on the stance the researcher assumes on the role the culture plays in decision-making , one of the following models is used to think of and predict decision-making behavioral patterns in a given culture : Occidental philosophies are known for the extensive use of analytical thinking – a methodical approach to solving complex problems by breaking them into their constituent parts , and identifying the cause and effect patterns of the constituent parts , while Oriental philosophies are well known for their emphasis on holism – the idea that the properties of a given system cannot be determined or explained by its components &amp; apos ; parts alone , but the system as a whole determines how the parts behave .
This discrepancy brings about further differences in values and beliefs that can be practically displayed in how different cultures manage their public institutions .
For example , culturally determined attitudes towards age , gender roles , and the end result are well reflected in the way these cultures build and run their health-care systems .
Oriental cultures hold that age is a proxy to experience and hence to wisdom , that the individual should mind their duty without focusing on the final results of the activity , and that women are best suited to play certain roles .
On the other hand , Occidental cultures hold that age is not correlated to wisdom , the individual should focus on the end and drive to achieve it , and women are equal to men in all respects .
These differences become obvious when health-care systems of an Oriental and Occidental cultures are compared .
In Indian health-care setting customers are much less likely to sue their physicians , – who is usually a representative of an older generation – even when having enough evidence of malpractice , due to the fact that their age is treated as a proxy to experience and knowledge .
Hence , the decision to sue a physician for deficiencies doesn &amp; apos ; t occur as a choice or option to most Indian patients , who are representatives of the Oriental culture .
In the Indian setting physicians are , however , normally accountable for the care given , even though rarely blamed for unfavorable results , which can be explained by the fact they hold in high regard the means of an action , and not the end .
Another distinguishing feature of Indian hospitals is that women are mostly employed as receptionists , billing clerks , and admission assistants .
This trend in hiring policy can be explained against gender and role expectation dimension , and by the inculcated in Oriental cultures belief that each element has a predefined place in the system . Individuals who come from the Oriental cultures with philosophies promoting holistic thinking are found to be better than their Occidental counterparts at noticing the changes in backgrounds , whereas individuals from Occidental cultures who use analytic reasoning tend to be better at recognizing changes in focal objects &amp; # 91 ; 8 &amp; # 93 ; .
The differences in perception might be the result of different standpoints in the corresponding philosophies .
It can be taken into consideration when explaining profound divergences in how willing the Westerners and the Easterners are to compromise when they make consumer choices .
Just as much as the low-context Westerners are more likely to notice the changes in the salient objects , they are more likely to believe in a single right answer and pursue even the slightest indication that one option is better than all others , whereas the high-context Easterners begin the decision making process already favoring the compromise option . The individuals from high- and low-context cultures also differ in their communication styles .
The former prefer the less direct style , and thereby they are less explicit in stating their feelings , desires , and intentions when communicating verbally .
The latter , on the contrary , are less likely to camouflage their message and conceal their intentions .
The culturally normative communication style also enhances people &amp; apos ; s responsiveness to the transmitted message and influences the perception of the communicator .
It influences hiring decisions .
HR agents in low-context cultures are more likely to hire direct , assertive , and somewhat aggressive candidates , whereas the reverse pattern is observed in high-context cultures . Individuals from different cultures tend to have different views of the self , which affects individuals &amp; apos ; cognition , goals in social interactions , and consequently influences their behavior and goals in decision making .
Individuals from individualist &amp; apos ; s cultures tend to have independent self-construal and thus experience happiness as a socially disengaging emotion ( e . g . , pride ) , and those from collectivist &amp; apos ; s cultures tend to have interdependent self-construal and experience happiness as a socially engaging emotion ( e . g . , peace and harmony ) .
The former are more likely to make decisions to fulfill personal accomplishment , whereas the latter are more likely to make decisions that promote social connectedness .
This is reflected in their differences in the teamwork styles .
A group composed of members with low independent self-construal prefer the cooperative strategy to the competitive one , whereas a group composed of members with high independent self construal preferred the competitive strategy to the cooperative one . Individuals from cultures with interdependent social orientation believe that public good overrides individual benefit , whereas individuals from cultures with independent social orientation believe that every individual should strive to achieve their best .
Thereby , when engaging in the decision-making process the former are more likely to take into consideration the injunctive norms , guarding stability within the society , while the former are more likely to follow their introjected goals .
For instance , Indians are found to accommodate to authority figures and significant others and respond to others &amp; apos ; expectations when choosing what clothes to wear for a party , and what advanced training courses to take .
In each corresponding case , Americans were more likely to act with accordance with their own beliefs of what will be beneficial to them and didn &amp; apos ; t demonstrate the &amp; apos ; deference syndrome &amp; apos ; .
In Western cultures ( Independent ) , strength and integrity are demonstrated by being true to one ’ s own opinions and tastes and not being swayed by social pressure to conform .
As opposed to seeing individual freedom as a prerequisite to an authentic life , interdependent cultures evaluate freedom in terms of its costs and beneﬁts to the group . 1411 . In addition to that , individualist societies with dominant with independent self-construal which is typical for western society are more likely to rely on feelings and consequently more impulsive in their decision making compared to people with an interdependent self-construal which more typical for eastern sociesty There is a difference in the decision making patterns between cultures with independent and interdependent social orientations in the situations when risk-taking is involved , namely the members of cultural groups with high independency show more risk-aversive behavior .
It is interesting to note that this pattern is observed only when risk is material in its nature , and not observed when risk is of the social nature .
The cushion hypothesis attempts to explain this difference .
It suggests that members of a collectivist society are more prone to risk-taking in the financial domain , because they know they will more likely receive help from their friends or extended family when they &amp; quot ; fall &amp; quot ; , as collectivism endorses social relatedness and interdependence .
Social networks in such societies can serve as potent material-risk insurance and correspond to the notion &amp; quot ; social capital &amp; quot ; .
Risk-aversion tendency among members of individualist societies are observed even in the contexts that involve financial risks only indirectly , for instance in decision-making contexts that involve estimating the risk of revealing private information to gain access to mobile banking . Affect forecasts play an important role in driving decisions .
The members of independent and interdependent societies differ in the degree they rely on the expected enjoyment when making choices .
Euro-Canadians , who are representatives of the independent social orientation , place more weight on expected enjoyment , whereas East Asians , who are representatives of the interdependent social orientation , warn against excessive hedonism , as their concern with social obligations precludes the uncompromising pursuit of positive affect .
This pattern can be observed in the higher education setting , when Euro-Canadian and East Asian students &amp; apos ; choices of what courses to enroll in are compared .
Euro-Canadian students show a short-term orientation and tend to enroll in the courses which promise to be fun , whereas East Asian students enroll in the courses which they think will be beneficial for their careers and thus show long-term orientation . The high degree of tolerance for power distance in interdependent societies reflects the tendency to shun arrogance and consider humility as a virtue at all times in collectivist societies .
The tolerance for power distance also has practical implication , for instance , in the tourist decision-making styles .
Members of individualist societies with lower levels of tolerance for power distance are less likely to exhibit brand consciousness when making choices concerning their travelling arrangements , compared with their collectivist counterparts . There are a lot of differences between collectivist and Individualist .
For collectivists , when they to buy the brand extension product that low fit to the core product , they will focus not only on how much product fit to the core product but also focus on the size of company to guess the quality of product .
In contrast , in the same situation , Individualists will focus on just only how much brand extension product fit to the product and the size of company doesn &amp; apos ; t matter to guess the quality .
For example , If Core product of &amp; quot ; A &amp; quot ; company is ice cream , High fit product is yogurt , Low fit product is pen .
For Collectivist , if The A company is a large company , they might think that the pen maybe have a good quality .
But for the Individualist , will think that maybe Pen is not good because it &amp; apos ; s doesn &amp; apos ; t fit to the company identity .
and These kind of cognitive thinking might effect to decision-making .
In term of Marketing , Company Strategy should focus and concern about Corporate identity .
Especially , For Collectivists , they believe not only in how much brand extension product fit to core product but also believe in size of company ( reliability &amp; amp ; Trustworthy ) .
The literature on automatic cognition suggests that behavior is shaped by exposure to elements of the social world in a way that occurs below awareness or intention .
We learn the stereotyped attitudes which later influence our decisions from the shared schematic representations in a certain culture .
When an individual is primed with a concept , often by an implicit instruction to think about it , all the aspects of relevant information become activated and influence decision-making .
For example , the individuals who are instructed to underlie all first person plural pronouns in the text are thus primed with the concept of collectivism and then show a statistically significant increase in the inclination to make decisions according with the values of the concept they have been primed with . All individuals across cultures have cultural and personal knowledge .
Cultural knowledge tends to reflect a large sample of life &amp; apos ; s events , whereas personal knowledge focuses more on individual or atypical experiences .
The other distinction between cultural and personal knowledge is their accessibility .
Day after day members of a cultural group are primed with a set of beliefs , attitudes , and behavioral patterns , which contributes to the building-up and storing of the cultural knowledge .
Thus cultural knowledge is very accessible , even under high cognitive work load .
Personal knowledge is a recording of a single experience and doesn &amp; apos ; t undergo so many repetitions .
That &amp; apos ; s why it takes a deliberate attempt to access it , which requires more time and effort .
Consider the following example .
Independent individuals are believed to better respond to promotion-based information , whereas individuals with interdependent self construal are believed to better respond to prevention-based information . In high time pressure condition , this hypothesis is borne out : North Americans are more likely to make up their mind to buy a sun screen having watched a promotion-based commercial , and East Asians are more likely to make the purchase having watched a prevention-based commercial .
In the low time pressure condition , when the subjects have more time to deliberate , this difference becomes less salient , or even disappears altogether . Individuals in collectivist cultures are less inclined to act in accordance with their cultural beliefs when they don &amp; apos ; t experience peer pressure .
In accordance with what collectivist culture dictates , Japanese and Chinese students are more likely , compared with American and Italian students , to decide whether they will eat in a fast food restaurants contingent on the norms adopted in their societies , and less likely to make choices contingent on their personal attitudes .
However , this peculiarity is much more salient when they make plans whether to eat with their friends and less salient when they decide whether to eat in a fast food restaurant on their own .
In the latter context , the likelihood they will act contingent on their attitudes significantly increases . Cultural knowledge is recruited when individuals need to provide reasons for their decision .
The need to provide reasons evokes an information-processing strategy that relies on top-down application of rules and principles instead of bottom-up processing that relies on personal knowledge .
This can be explained with the help of the supposition that individuals feel the pressure to conform when asked to provide reasons , as they don &amp; apos ; t want to be the outsiders .
When they are not asked to explain their choices , they feel freer to rely on their personal knowledge .
It has been found that Chinese have a significantly lower tendency to compromise , which earlier on has been found to be one of their characteristic traits , when not asked to provide reasons for their consumer decisions .
Americans , on the contrary , are more likely to compromise when they are not accountable to provide explanations for their choice . Widely shared cultural knowledge provides individuals with a validated framework to interpret otherwise ambiguous experience , thus providing its followers with a sense of epistemic security and providing protection from the uncertainty and unpredictability .
The individuals of all cultures vary in the degree they have a need for firm answers .
The individuals with high tolerance for ambiguity are found to be less likely to act with the accordance of their culture . Culture shapes the prevalence of cultural factors – decision content , decision motives , and situational demands and affordances – and shapes how functional factors translate into decision modes – calculation- , recognition- , rule- , role- , and affect-based decision modes .
There are , however , a number of universal tendencies across cultures .
For example , when action is called for , members of both independent and interdependent social orientations tend to employ role- , rule- , or case-based decision making , as they are much more accessible and allow for less cognitive load , whereas calculation-based mode will be less frequent for relationship decisions in both orientations . The more resource rich the physical environment becomes due to modern technologies , the larger is the number of cultures it can support .
The development of technologies that increases the resources extracted from the environment inevitably allows a greater diversity of cultures to occupy a given area .
More and more of the cultural variants available to members of a modernized societies are transmitted between people who are not kin , friends , or even acquaintances .
Young people are more likely to create novel recombinations of diverse cultural variants .
Although the choice is wide , the same range of choices is increasingly available all over the world .
Waves of modernization have created complex cultures with substantial diversity within them , but have decreased the inter-group diversity by destroying small-scale variations . We believe that the different Catering Culture also make a difference in decision-making .
Most of the people from collectivist culture pay more attention to the process .
For example , we found that many of the Chinese food and Japanese food always need more than 1 day to cook and some of them even need more than 1 month or longer .
On the other side , we found that the western people , who are belong to Individualism , more likely to make it easy , because they can eat alone and quickly .
However , with the development of the Modernization , the communication between the Catering Culture have a great influence to the Cross-culture difference .
We found that more an more teenagers of collectivist , such as student of China , Korea and Japan , seems like to be more individualism .
And we can just found the change by observing their eating habits .
But there is still no validity study to get a further research between them .
Although the young people of collectivist may have some characteristic of individualism , We can still assume that they might be more collectivist at some stage .
We always think that the individualism and collectivism are something native , however , the eastern young people now didn &amp; apos ; t act as an interdependent person like their parents .
So It would be also an interesting study to see how the individualist young people become more collectivist and When and Why they have this kind of change . Many of the researchers always think that most of the eastern country are more collectivist .
However , we can still found that , Japan is always different to other eastern countries such as China and Korea .
All of them have same history and share same writing in the past .
But Japan always make a different choice .
Just like the World War II , both of China and Korea are looking forward to the doctrine of the mean , which is called &amp; apos ; Zhongyong &amp; apos ; in Chinese , and that made them become invaders .
However , Japan shows different way of thinking and became one of the member of aggressor .
We can &amp; apos ; t just simply said they are bad or have some problems .
As a research , we need to found that what actually is the cause of the culture of collectivism , and how they work .
Even if the three countries share so many things , they still have some big difference between each other .
So it &amp; apos ; s still important to researchers to study deeper the collectivism to found the real motivation of it and how it makes people more interdependent .

Human rights violations in Pinochet &amp; apos ; s ChileHuman rights violations during the military government of Chile refer to the acts of human rights abuses , persecution of opponents , political repression and state terrorism committed by the Chilean armed forces and the Police , government agents and civilians in the service of security agencies , during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile from September 11 , 1973 , until March 11 , 1990 . According to the Commission of Truth and Reconciliation ( Rettig Commission ) and the National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture ( Valech Commission ) , the number of direct victims of human rights violations in Chile accounts for around 30,000 people : 27,255 tortured and 2,279 executed .
In addition , some 200,000 people suffered exile and an unknown number went through clandestine centers and illegal detention . The systematic human rights violations that were committed by the military government of Chile , under General Augusto Pinochet , included gruesome acts of physical and sexual abuse , as well as psychological damage .
From September 11 , 1973 to March 11 , 1990 , Chilean armed forces , the police and all those aligned with the military junta were involved in institutionalizing fear and terror in Chile . The most prevalent forms of state-sponsored torture that Chilean prisoners endured were electric shocks , waterboarding , beatings , and sexual abuse .
Another common mechanism of torture employed was &amp; quot ; disappearing &amp; quot ; those who were deemed to be potentially subversive because they adhered to leftist political doctrines .
The tactic of &amp; quot ; disappearing &amp; quot ; the enemies of the Pinochet regime was systematically carried out during the first four years of military rule .
The &amp; quot ; disappeared &amp; quot ; were held in secret , subjected to torture and were often never seen again .
Both the National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture ( Valech Report ) and the Commission of Truth and Reconciliation ( Rettig Report ) approximate that there were around 30,000 victims of human rights abuses in Chile , with 27,255 tortured and 2,279 executed . The military rule was characterized by systematic suppression of all political dissidence , which led some to speak of a &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; politicide &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( or &amp; quot ; political genocide &amp; quot ; ) .
Steve J .
Stern spoke of a politicide to describe &amp; quot ; a systematic project to destroy an entire way of doing and understanding politics and governance . &amp; quot ; The worst violence occurred in the first three months of the coup &amp; apos ; s aftermath , with the number of suspected leftists killed or &amp; quot ; disappeared &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; desaparecidos &amp; quot ; ) soon reaching into the thousands .
In the days immediately following the coup , the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs informed Henry Kissinger that the National Stadium was being used to hold 5,000 prisoners , and as late as 1975 , the CIA was still reporting that up to 3,811 prisoners were still being held in the Stadium .
Amnesty International , reported that as many as 7,000 political prisoners in the National Stadium had been counted on 22 September 1973 .
Nevertheless , it is often quoted in the press , that some 40,000 prisoners were detained in the Stadium .
Some of the most famous cases of &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; desaparecidos &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; are Charles Horman , a U . S .
citizen who was killed during the coup itself , Chilean songwriter Víctor Jara , and the October 1973 Caravan of Death ( &amp; quot ; Caravana de la Muerte &amp; quot ; ) where at least 70 persons were killed .
Other operations include Operation Colombo during which hundreds of left-wing activists were murdered and Operation Condor , carried out with the security services of other Latin American dictatorships .
Following Pinochet &amp; apos ; s defeat in the 1988 plebiscite , the 1991 Rettig Commission , a multipartisan effort from the Aylwin administration to discover the truth about the human-rights violations , listed a number of torture and detention centers ( such as Colonia Dignidad , the ship &amp; quot ; Esmeralda &amp; quot ; or Víctor Jara Stadium ) , and found that at least 3,200 people were killed or disappeared by the regime . A later report , the Valech Report ( published in November 2004 ) , confirmed the figure of 3,200 deaths but dramatically reduced the alleged cases of disappearances .
It tells of some 28,000 arrests in which the majority of those detained were incarcerated and in a great many cases tortured .
Some 30,000 Chileans were exiled and received abroad , in particular in Argentina , as political refugees ; however , they were followed in their exile by the DINA secret police , in the frame of Operation Condor which linked South-American dictatorships together against political opponents .
Some 20,000-40,000 Chilean exiles were holders of passports stamped with the letter &amp; quot ; L &amp; quot ; ( which stood for &amp; quot ; lista nacional &amp; quot ; ) , identifyng them as &amp; quot ; persona non grata &amp; quot ; and had to seek permission before entering the country .
Nevertheless , Chilean Human Rights groups maintain several hundred thousand were forced into exile . According to the Latin American Institute on Mental Health and Human Rights ( ILAS ) , &amp; quot ; situations of extreme trauma &amp; quot ; affected about 200,000 persons ; this figure includes individuals killed , tortured ( following the UN definition of torture ) , or exiled and their immediate relatives .
While more radical groups such as the Movement of the Revolutionary Left ( MIR ) were staunch advocates of a Marxist revolution , it is currently accepted that the junta deliberately targeted nonviolent political opponents as well . A court in Chile sentenced , on March 19 , 2008 , 24 former police officers in cases of kidnapping , torture and murder that happened just after a U . S . -backed coup overthrew President Salvador Allende , a Socialist , on September 11 , 1973 . The concept of bureaucratic authoritarianism characterizes the military regimes that rose to power in South America between the 1960s and 1980s , specifically in the Southern Cone regions of Argentina , Chile , Paraguay and Uruguay .
These regimes had a technocratic approach to policy-making , and were accompanied by substantial repression .
Guillermo O &amp; apos ; Donnell — a prominent Argentine political scientist — labeled these regimes as &amp; quot ; bureaucratic authoritarian &amp; quot ; in order to &amp; quot ; distinguish them from oligarchical and populist forms of authoritarian rule found in less modernized countries . &amp; quot ; From its inception on September 11 , 1973 , the Chilean bureaucratic authoritarian regime &amp; apos ; s ultimate agenda was to repress political dissidents — which some have classified as &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; politicide &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( or &amp; quot ; political genocide ) .
General Pinochet &amp; apos ; s assumption of power through a violent , and bloody military coup d &amp; apos ; état foreshadowed the brutal conditions that many innocent people would endure over the next 17 years .
Pinochet genuinely feared the supporters of the Popular Unity Party ( PU ) and its leader President Salvador Allende , who had been the first Marxist to become President of a Latin American region through open elections .
General Pinochet lived in a state of paranoia , and constantly feared being assassinated or losing power .
Thus , he set out to destroy those who were not in unity with his policies , particularly those who had once served the PU . As Pinochet &amp; apos ; s suspicions grew , the military dictator targeted anyone who was in someway associated with the &amp; quot ; leftists , &amp; quot ; which even included the mothers , wives and children of the potential subversives .
In order to legitimize control of the country , Pinochet created institutions that were seemingly democratic .
He organized a plebiscite on October 21 , 1980 and drafted a new Constitution that validated the legal system he had established by decree .
The Constitution proscribed an 8- year election period , permitted reelections and gave the President of the Republic an immense amount of power .
Laws were passed to criminalize acts of terror and limit the use of &amp; quot ; habeas corpus &amp; quot ; .
A crucial aspect of the Pinochet regime was how unified the military was .
Another was the disarray of civilian society , which created an atmosphere that was conducive to repressing all those who supposedly supported the PU , other leftist organizations , and even Centrist institutions like the Christian Democratic Party . From the moment Pinochet assumed power , he wanted to instill a sense of fear in the Chilean population .
These fears manifested with his authorization of the &amp; quot ; Caravan of Death &amp; quot ; .
Following the coup on September 11 , Pinochet ordered this Chilean Army death squad to target the leaders of the PU by any means necessary .
The Caravan of Death , under the leadership of Sergio Arellano Stark , killed 68 people within three days , by stabbing , beating and shooting them .
The establishment of the Caravan of Death served three main purposes : 1 ) silence dissent through murder , 2 ) weed out military officials who were not aligned with Pinochet &amp; apos ; s regime and 3 ) establish fear within leadership ranks .
The Caravan of Death resulted in the institutionalization of a state-sponsored system of terror . On June 14 , 1974 , Junta Decree 521 mandated for the creation of the National Intelligence Directorate ( DINA ) .
There were thousands of people working in this agency .
DINA was instituted to &amp; quot ; produce the intelligence necessary to formulate policies and planning , and to adopt measures to procure the safeguarding of National Security and development of the country . &amp; quot ; DINA established interrogation and detention camps , in which former members of Allende &amp; apos ; s Marxist government and the Leftist movements like the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria were incarcerated and brutally tortured .
Pinochet &amp; apos ; s goal was to annihilate all forms of opposition .
He therefore greatly supported Military Decree 1697 , which outlawed the formation of any political party .
A large proportion of the Chilean population was vulnerable to surveillance .
Chile &amp; apos ; s churches , universities , businesses , and neighborhoods were all under intense scrutiny . The Joint Command operated as a de facto institution from late 1975 until late 1976 , and was based primarily in Santiago , Chile .
Like DINA , this institution coordinated intelligence activities and political repression , with the air force having a major role in carrying out its agendas .
The Joint Command was responsible for &amp; quot ; disappearing &amp; quot ; approximately thirty people during the bureaucratic authoritarian era . From 1974 to 1977 , DINA ( National Intelligence Directorate ) and other agencies such as the Joint Command were the main institutions responsible for committing most acts of repression .
It was during this period when most of the forced disappearances took place .
While these agencies committed barbaric acts of physical and sexual torture , they also caused an immense amount of psychological pain and suffering . Intelligence agencies under Pinochet &amp; apos ; s regime instituted secret detention and torture sites to conduct political repression .
In total , Chile had 17 torture centers .
On occasion , prisoners were released after being confined and tortured .
However , many detainees were also killed and &amp; quot ; disappeared . &amp; quot ; Cuatro Alamos was a detention center that no one outside the DINA had access to , except personnel from other intelligence agencies .
It was instituted in 1973 , during the earliest phase of the regime .
Life in Cuatro Alamos was relatively easier than it was in other detention sites .
It consisted of twelve small cells , one large cell and staff offices .
There were very few instances of torture within the walls of the prison . Londres No .
38 was a secret detention center located in downtown Santiago , where DINA members operated from 1973 until the end of 1974 .
This was one of the many sites that had been previously owned by leftist organizations .
Prisoners at Londres No .
38 endured lengthy interrogation periods and continual humiliating treatment .
Captors preferred to torture detainees by electrocuting them .
Not only were the suspects incarcerated , but their relatives were also arrested .
Family members underwent sexual abuse in the presence of their relatives .
However , during the initial period , prisoners were still permitted to interact with one another and share information . Villa Grimaldi , located in Santiago , was DINA &amp; apos ; s most important torture center that began operating in 1974 .
Prisoners were interrogated for long periods of time .
Once people were incarcerated on a massive scale , new places were reconditioned to hold them .
The &amp; quot ; tower &amp; quot ; was designated as a holding center for political prisoners .
There was a water tank on the top floor of the building , which included ten tight spaces where prisoners were held .
These spaces were so small that victims had to enter them by crawling on their knees .
The tower also included a torture chamber , where prisoners were kept in isolation .
Many of them were never seen again .
Food was scarce and the conditions were extremely unsanitary . One torture method which was very commonly used was the &amp; quot ; grill &amp; quot ; or &amp; quot ; La Parrilla . &amp; quot ; In this torture , electricity was fed from a standard wall outlet through a control box into two wires each terminating in electrodes .
The control box gave the torturers the option of adjusting the voltage being administered to the prisoner .
The naked prisoner was stretched out and strapped onto a metal bedframe , or a set of bedsprings , and tied down .
He or she was subjected to electrical shocks on several parts of the body , especially on sensitive areas like the genitals and on open wounds .
The Valech Report includes a testimony of a Chilean man who was interrogated by prison captors .
They took off his clothes and &amp; quot ; attached electrodes to his chest and testicles .
They put something in his mouth so he would &amp; quot ; bite his tongue while they shocked him . &amp; quot ; In another method , one of the wires would be fixed to the prisoner ( typically to the victim &amp; apos ; s genitalia ) while another wire could be applied to other parts of the body .
This caused an electric current to pass through the victim &amp; apos ; s body , with a strength inversely proportional to the distance between the two electrodes .
A smaller distance between the electrodes led to a stronger current and thus more intense pain for the prisoner .
A particularly barbaric version of the &amp; quot ; grill &amp; quot ; was the use of a metal bunk bed ; the victim was placed on the bottom bunk and on the top bunk , a relative or friend was simultaneously tortured . Most prisoners suffered from severe beatings , and broken or even amputated limbs .
At Villa Grimaldi , DINA forced non-compliant prisoners to lie down on the ground .
The captors ran over their legs with a large vehicle , and crushed the prisoners &amp; apos ; bones .
The assailants also beat prisoners in the ear until they became deaf , and entirely unconscious ; this torture method was called the &amp; quot ; telephone . &amp; quot ; Most of the acts of punishment were intended to severely humiliate the prisoners .
At the Pisagua Concentration Camp , captors intimidated prisoners by forcing them to crawl on the ground and lick the dirt off the floors .
If the prisoners complained or even collapsed from exhaustion , they were promptly executed .
Prisoners were also immersed into vats of excrement , and were occasionally forced to ingest it . Pinochet &amp; apos ; s regime carried out many gruesome and horrific acts of sexual abuse against the victims .
In fact , several detention sites were solely instituted for the purpose of sexually tormenting and humiliating the prisoners .
Discothèque ( La Venda Sexy ) was another one of DINA &amp; apos ; s main secret detention centers .
Many of those who &amp; quot ; disappeared &amp; quot ; were initially held in this prison .
The prison guards often raped both men and women .
It was at this prison where internal repression operations were centralized .
Militants anally raped male prisoners , while insulting them , in an attempt to embarrass them to their core . Women were the primary targets of gruesome acts of sexual abuse .
According to the Valech Commission , almost every single female prisoner was a victim of repeated rape .
Not only would military men rape women , they would also use foreign objects and even animals to inflict more pain and suffering .
Women ( and occasionally men ) reported that spiders and live rats were often implanted on their genitals .
One woman testified that she had been &amp; quot ; raped and sexually assaulted with trained dogs and with live rats . &amp; quot ; She was forced to have sex with her father and brother — who were also detained . The military junta often framed leftist individuals and groups , in order to justify its agenda to target and torture political dissidents .
The Junta fostered fear of leftists by staging arsenal captures and portraying leftist extremists in an extremely negative light .
The regime falsely accused leftists of stealing dangerous weapons from weapons stores in order to justify the illegal capture of dissidents .
Such fake portrayals of &amp; quot ; the revolutionary threat &amp; quot ; resulted in the legitimization of the Pinochet regime .
The Junta commissioned the Chilean public to report the actions of any suspected leftists , and proceed to turn them in .
General Pinochet also authorized for DINA to stage the bombing of a Chilean safe house .
The blame was placed on the leftist extremists , in order to demonstrate the danger they posed to society .
Essentially , the military junta made use of brainwashing propaganda to portray the leftists as the enemies . Psychological torture was used to destroy a prisoner &amp; apos ; s will , dignity , moral and physical resolve in order to extract pertinent information from the victim .
Members of intelligence agencies like DINA and the Joint Command attempted to extract information from victims by threatening their children and loved ones .
Many mothers who were incarcerated in illegal detention centers had to choose between saving themselves or their children &amp; apos ; s lives .
On August 21 , 1989 , military personnel seized Jessica Antonia Liberona Ninoles and detained her in a dark , solitary room .
She was stripped naked , forced to lie down on an uncomfortable prison cot and was not permitted to sleep for five days during the interrogation period .
The captors constantly threatened to kidnap her nine-year-old daughter from school if she failed to cooperate . According to the Valech Commission , waterboarding was one of the torture methods most commonly recorded by victims of imprisonment and torture .
The captors poured water over a cloth that covered the victims &amp; apos ; faces and breathing passages , causing individuals to experience a drowning sensation , and a near-death experience .
Waterboarding caused detainees to asphyxiate , while their heads were submerged into water several times in a row .
Oftentimes , prisoners were hung upside-down with ropes , and they were dropped into a tank of water , headfirst .
The water was contaminated and filled with debris .
Waterboarding was employed to cause both physical and psychological pain ; however , victims found that the mental suffering they endured was far worse than the physical pain .
They attested that even thirty years after being &amp; quot ; waterboarded , &amp; quot ; they still suffered from the devastating effects of psychological torture .
Many victims reported suffering from post traumatic stress disorder , humiliation , worthlessness , shame , anxiety and hopelessness .
The Valech Commission Report describes the testimony of a man who experienced waterboarding in September 1973 : They put cotton on both eyes , then taped them and tightened a hood around my neck .
They tied my hands and legs , submerged me in a 250-liter tank that had ammonia , urine , excrement , and seawater .
They submerged me until I could not breathe anymore .
They repeated it over and over , while beating me and asking me questions .
That is what they called the submarine . While &amp; quot ; disappearing subversives &amp; quot ; was the central instrument of state terror administered by the Argentine military regime from the 1960s to the 1980s , it was still extremely widespread and prevalent in Chile as well .
According to the Rettig Report , 1,248 people were &amp; quot ; disappeared &amp; quot ; by the Pinochet Regime .
However , this number still remains a source of contention , as hundreds of bodies have yet to be discovered .
There are several different approximations made for the number of people who had been &amp; quot ; disappeared &amp; quot ; by the military regime .
Many of those who &amp; quot ; disappeared &amp; quot ; were not given the chance to escape nor become asylum seekers elsewhere .
Their bodies were deliberately hidden in undisclosed locations . Only seven days after the General seized power through a ruthless military coup , he ordered the military to round up approximately 10,000 students , workers , and political activists and jam them into Santiago &amp; apos ; s National Soccer Stadium on September 18 , 1973 .
This Stadium , that symbolized Chile &amp; apos ; s greatest pastime , turned into a concentration camp within a few days .
Many were tortured and gunned down , and several hundred bodies were shuttled into secret mass graves .
These were victims of a well-organized program of official , yet clandestine , program of torture and murder . Many people were last seen in the detention and torture centers instituted by the intelligence agencies of the military regime .
Following General Pinochet &amp; apos ; s arrest in 1998 , Chile made a renewed effort to uncover the atrocities of the past .
For the first time in a several decades , human rights lawyers , and members of the armed forces wanted to investigate where the bodies of the &amp; quot ; disappeared &amp; quot ; were buried .
On January 7 , 2000 , President Ricardo Lagos made a 15-minute nationwide address , revealing that the armed forces had uncovered information on the fate of approximately 180 people who had disappeared .
According to Lagos , the bodies of at least 150 of these people were thrown into lakes , rivers and the Pacific Ocean .
The whereabouts of hundreds of more bodies remain unknown . The Chilean Military Dictatorship under General Augusto Pinochet erected a complex web of legal instruments that it used to repress anyone deemed to be &amp; quot ; subversive . &amp; quot ; Pinochet was extremely tactical in his attempts to camouflage the human rights violations committed by the state .
He called for a National Plebiscite in 1980 to approve the 1980 Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile — a seemingly democratic motive .
The General promised to cut back inflation , which was around 30-35 % in 1978 ; he was intent on restructuring both the economic and political institutions of the region .
These agendas were part of a broader scheme to garner approval from the state , making it more feasible to prosecute , imprison , and execute civilians suspected of subversion .
The military and armed personnel under Pinochet were able to operate offensively without restrictions , as the Chilean Government had been restructured to Pinochet &amp; apos ; s liking .
Even the Constitution was drafted to give the General impunity .
The military dictatorship utilized its own justice system to adjudicate the regime &amp; apos ; s enemies . Additionally , the Amnesty Law decreed in 1978 by the General , guaranteed impunity to those responsible for the &amp; quot ; systematic and widespread human rights violations and was a major obstacle to bringing Augusto Pinochet to justice in Chile .
Even today , &amp; quot ; the Amnesty Law is still in force .
It was recently applied by the Chilean Supreme Court in December 2007 . &amp; quot ; While Pinochet was detained under house arrest on October 30 , 2006 , over &amp; quot ; charges including , murder , torture and kidnapping in the years following his 1973 coup , he was never formally convicted .
He died before the investigation process reached a conclusion .
Pinochet &amp; apos ; s Amnesty Law effectively insulated the military regime from retribution for even the most brutal and horrific human rights violations . The &amp; quot ; Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional &amp; quot ; ( ) or DINA was the Chilean secret police in the government of Augusto Pinochet .
DINA was established in November 1973 , as a Chilean Army intelligence unit headed by General Manuel Contreras and vice-director Raúl Iturriaga , who fled from justice in 2007 .
It was separated from the army and made an independent administrative unit in June 1974 , under the aegis of decree # 521 .
DINA made it possible for Augusto Pinochet to come to power . DINA existed until 1977 , after which it was renamed the Central Nacional de Informaciones ( CNI ) ( &amp; quot ; National Information Center &amp; quot ; ) . Since human rights violations during the military regime corresponded to a state policy , the number of people involved in these acts as authors , accomplices or accessories , is high .
While it is difficult to determine their number , it is estimated that exceeds several hundred .
Approximately sixty persons have been condemned by Chilean courts .

Boyz 4 Now &amp; quot ; Boyz 4 Now &amp; quot ; is the 21st episode of the third season of the American animated comedy series &amp; quot ; Bob &amp; apos ; s Burgers &amp; quot ; .
Written by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux , the episode features guest appearances from actors Max Greenfield and Jack McBrayer and comedian Tig Notaro .
Its main plot sees Louise Belcher ( Kristen Schaal ) becoming aghast to find herself developing a crush on a member of the boy band Boyz 4 Now ( Greenfield ) , after she reluctantly attends one of their concerts with her sister Tina ( Dan Mintz ) .
In a subplot , Gene Belcher ( Eugene Mirman ) qualifies for a regional competition in tablescaping , an activity involving the setting of dining tables based on a selected theme . The series &amp; apos ; production crew opted to make the group Boyz 4 Now a general parody of boy bands rather than base them on any specific artist , as they all had several different boy bands which &amp; quot ; made them chuckle &amp; quot ; while making the episode .
Creator Loren Bouchard assigned several female staff members with the task of designing the physical appearances and wardrobes of Boyz 4 Now &amp; apos ; s members .
The episode originally aired on April 28 , 2013 on Fox , drawing an audience of 3 . 50 million viewers , and was met with generally positive reviews from critics , who commended its main plot for exploring the more vulnerable , feminine side of Louise &amp; apos ; s character and her sisterly relationship with Tina . Tina and Louise &amp; apos ; s aunt Gayle ( Megan Mullally ) has bought them tickets to an upcoming concert by the popular boy band Boyz 4 Now .
Tina is excited , but Louise , who dislikes boy bands , only agrees to go at the insistence of her mother Linda ( John Roberts ) .
Gene has qualified for a regional tablescaping competition , which Bob ( H .
Jon Benjamin ) and Linda escort him to .
Louise rejoices after a pet emergency leaves Gayle unable to bring the sisters to the concert , but reluctantly agrees to help find another ride after seeing Tina &amp; apos ; s disappointment .
They hitch a ride with Zeke ( Bobby Tisdale ) and his older cousin Leslie ( Jack McBrayer ) , who are going to the concert to sell bootleg T-shirts and hot dogs .
Bob and Linda later meet the arrogant father of a fellow competitor named Oscar Anthony , which drives them to push Gene to win . At the concert venue , Louise scoffs at the band &amp; apos ; s obsessed female fans , warns Tina that &amp; quot ; a lot of puberty &amp; quot ; awaits her at the concert , and plans to wait outside .
However , she is forced to bring Tina inside to prevent her from fainting .
Meanwhile , Gene impresses the judges with a magic-themed table display and advances to the top four .
Having not fully read the competition rule book , however , he is left unprepared to produce a second table display for the next round .
The concert begins before Louise can exit , and she remains unimpressed until the band &amp; apos ; s prepubescent youngest member , Boo Boo , comes onstage .
Louise is left frozen in awe by his looks , and once the band &amp; apos ; s first song starts she starts excitedly screaming out his name .
Horrified at what she has done , she runs out in denial about liking Boo Boo , having never had a previous crush . Louise runs back to the concert and starts asking Tina questions about Boo Boo , and Tina correctly deduces that she has a crush on him .
Seeing Louise &amp; apos ; s panicked reaction , Tina promises to help and gets her to reveal her desire to slap Boo Boo &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; hideous , beautiful face . &amp; quot ; Having been denied access to the band &amp; apos ; s backstage room , Louise and Tina sneak into their tour bus after the concert .
Their cover is blown by Louise , who emerges from their hiding place desperately wanting to meet Boo Boo .
The bus pulls over and the sisters debark , but not before Louise fulfills her desire to slap Boo Boo in the face .
Gayle picks them up , and on the way home Louise thanks Tina for her support and says that she is over her crush .
At the tablescaping competition , Gene &amp; apos ; s improvised menstruation-themed display is deemed offensive by the judges and causes him to end up in fourth place ; nonetheless , the Belchers are satisfied to see Oscar &amp; apos ; s father crying over losing .
That night , Louise secretly pulls out a poster of Boo Boo , slapping his face gently before going to sleep . &amp; quot ; Boyz 4 Now &amp; quot ; was written by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux and directed by Anthony Chun .
Upon hearing the writers &amp; apos ; pitch of the episode , series creator Loren Bouchard found its plot to be &amp; quot ; such an immediately appealing story &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; a great way to have Louise peek over the other side of adolescence and look into the abyss . &amp; quot ; In an interview with &amp; quot ; Rolling Stone , &amp; quot ; Bouchard cited &amp; quot ; Boyz 4 Now &amp; quot ; as one of his favorite episodes of the series and revealed his liking of &amp; quot ; episodes where Louise is a little vulnerable . . . you don &amp; apos ; t want her to be as invulnerable as she pretends to be .
If you try to keep the show grounded , then you periodically have to say , she &amp; apos ; s a nine-year-old girl . &amp; quot ; He added that while the character has &amp; quot ; an adult sensibility about a lot of stuff , &amp; quot ; he and the writing staff try to &amp; quot ; look for ways to bring her back down to earth , &amp; quot ; citing the episode &amp; apos ; s depiction of Louise &amp; quot ; fighting against growing up , &amp; quot ; with Tina acting as &amp; quot ; her strange ambassador into that world . . . in some ways , you couldn &amp; apos ; t ask for a better guide . &amp; quot ; The eponymous group which &amp; quot ; Boyz 4 Now &amp; quot ; centers around was written as a general parody of boy bands , and not with any particular group in mind .
Bouchard explained that the choice of using a non-specific type of parody was not brought about by fears that the episode would become dated , but rather because the staff all had different boy bands that &amp; quot ; made them chuckle . &amp; quot ; He did , however , specifically research the English-Irish boy band One Direction for the episode because he &amp; quot ; wanted to see what the state of the art was &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; hadn &amp; apos ; t been that interested in Boyz II Men or Backstreet Boys or &amp; apos ; N Sync . &amp; quot ; The staff had differing opinions on what Boyz 4 Now &amp; apos ; s clothes and hair would look like , choices which Bouchard ultimately left to &amp; quot ; some of the many talented women who work on the show who had much stronger feelings about boy bands . &amp; quot ; Actor Max Greenfield guest stars in the episode voicing Boo Boo , a member of Boyz 4 Now whom Louise develops a crush on .
Series writers Steven Davis , Kelvin Yu , and Scott Jacobson composed and recorded the song &amp; quot ; Will You Be Mine ( Coal Mine ) &amp; quot ; for the episode and completed it before its table read , while Greenfield was later asked to record vocals .
The &amp; quot ; Bob &amp; apos ; s Burgers &amp; quot ; writing staff later named it their fourth favorite song from the series .
Other guests include stand-up comic Tig Notaro , who voices the band &amp; apos ; s tour bus driver Jody , and actor Jack McBrayer , who reprises his voice role as Zeke &amp; apos ; s older cousin Leslie . &amp; quot ; Boyz 4 Now &amp; quot ; first aired in the United States on April 28 , 2013 on Fox , as a part of the Animation Domination programming block .
The episode was watched by 3 . 50 million viewers and received a 1 . 7 / 5 Nielsen rating in the 18 – 49 demographic , becoming the fourth most-watched program of the Animation Domination block for the night .
Pilot Viruet of &amp; quot ; The A . V .
Club &amp; quot ; graded the episode an A – , writing that it was &amp; quot ; full of funny moments throughout . &amp; quot ; Viruet felt that &amp; quot ; Boyz 4 Now &amp; quot ; was most successful at building the relationship between Tina and Louise , noting that the latter &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; three-hour crush throws her for such a loop that she emerges with a newfound respect for Tina who deals with this every day . &amp; quot ; She also praised the tablescaping competition subplot , labelling it as &amp; quot ; equally hilarious and absurd &amp; quot ; as the main plot . Matt Brassil of Heave Media ranked &amp; quot ; Boyz 4 Now &amp; quot ; as the seventh-best television episode of 2013 , stating that the episode &amp; apos ; s handling of Louise &amp; apos ; s crush &amp; quot ; cracks through that little girl surface into the inevitable woman &amp; # 91 ; she &amp; # 93 ; will become , and the writing starts to show how even the most maniacal girl with a bunny hat can be humanized . &amp; quot ; Phillip Maciak , writing for the &amp; quot ; Los Angeles Review of Books &amp; quot ; , named Kristen Schaal &amp; apos ; s voice acting as Louise on &amp; quot ; Bob &amp; apos ; s Burgers &amp; quot ; as his favorite television performance of the year and cited her performance in the episode : &amp; quot ; Schaal &amp; apos ; s handling of the anger and betrayal Louise feels as she finds herself attracting to a boy for the first time is actually quite moving .
But , more than that , it opens up a new register of this top-register performance as Louise ’ s murderous rage turns to murderous romance . &amp; quot ;

Portrait of a Young Man ( Iravani ) Portrait of a young man or The young man is a mid-nineteenth century watercolor painting by Mirza Gadim Iravani , an Azerbaijani painter .
The painting is stored in the National Art Museum of Azerbaijan in Baku .
The ornamentality is thoroughly harmonized with volumetric and plastic modeling of the shape as in other paintings by Iravani .
Although the portrait was closely related to traditions of the medieval oriental miniature , the artist &amp; apos ; s interest in the external appearance of a man portrayed on a three-dimensional space of a concrete interior illustrate a crucial development in the Azerbaijani visual arts of the time .
A slender young man is portrayed against a background of a wall decorated with fine ornaments and diamond-shaped frames where each diamond is decorated with blue flowers .
The face of the young man is framed with dark shoulder-length hair .
A blurry picture of plump lips gives the face a naughty expression .
The young man is dressed in an arkhalig made of tirma , with short sleeves .
The ends of the garment are decorated with a flower-patterned fringe .
The arkhalig is wide open and a blue shirt is visible underneath .
The dark blue trousers complete the brightness of the garments .
There is an inscription in the horizontal ochre colored line : &amp; quot ; “ Portrait of His Excellency , noble Vajullah Mirza .
Painted by humble Mirza Gadim Iravani . ” &amp; quot ; An error occurred in the previous reading of this inscription .
Thus , the word “ navvab ” ( noble ) was thought to be the name of the painter when the painting was first registered in them museum .
As a result , the portrait of a young man had been identified as a portrait painted by Mir Mohsun Navvab in his youth .

Matthew NakkarMatthew Gregory Nakkar ( born in 1795 - died on 22 March 1868 ) was a Bishop of the Syriac Orthodox Church and later a Catholic bishop . Matthew Nakkar was born in 1795 in a family in which from generation to generation for 600 years monopolized the Jacobite see of Mosul .
At age 25 , he was ordained a priest and served under his uncle , the Metropolitan , and in 1826 succeeded him as Metropolitan .
Matthew Nakkar since his childhood brought up to hate the Catholics , and as subsequently confessed in his &amp; quot ; Memoirs &amp; quot ; tirelessly preached against Catholic teaching and doing everything possible to stop the Catholics to spread their faith .
However , despite the opposition of the Catholic Church and not of the Ottoman Empire , the number willing to Catholicism is constantly growing .
Between 1825 and 1830 almost all Jacobites of Damascus and southern Lebanon , including Bishop James al-Haliani , joined to Catholic Church . The patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church sent Matthew Nakkar to Damascus to be coped with the problems .
His task was to seize by the Turkish authorities of Bishop James al-Haliani , however , Matthew was unable to catch him , because al-Haliani managed to hide in the mountains near the Lebanese Maronites .
All that managed to Saint Matthew - it recovered to jail 25 people to Catholicism , after which he went to Jerusalem to meet the Passover .
Matthew Nakkar hoping to witness the descent of the Holy Fire - a miracle , which was one of the major arguments against Catholicism .
The contemplation of this miracle , as expected in March , was to give him the strength and determination in the fight against Catholics .
In Holy Saturday of 1832 Nakkar with his deacon came to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre .
They mingled with the crowd who wanted to light their own candles from the miraculous fire , Matthew Nakkar heard that the fire in the first few seconds does not burn any hands or face , or even a hair , so as soon as he lit his candle held it to his beard deacon however , Beard deacon immediately broke out .
Matthew accused his deacon due to lack of faith , however , the incident sowed doubt in his mind that he had been taught before .
Soon after his conversion to Catholicism were found in Aleppo , which became the seat of the Patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church .
Local Catholics staged a lavish reception to Matthew Nakkar , however , failed to appease his persecutor , they save only that started a month of Ramadan and the Turks , as Muslims , were not set up to organize the hunt in the holy month .
Metropolitan of Mosul Matthew Nakkar was forced to stay in the city for a month .
Thanks to the error of his servant , he stopped at the founding fathers of the Lazarists , whose monastery servant took over the hotel .
As the monks were warmly received Matthew , he decided to stay in the monastery , the decision is also influenced by his curiosity and desire to debate with &amp; quot ; heretics . &amp; quot ; The discussions mainly focused on provisions of Chalcedon and the question about the number of natures in Christ .
Soon Matthew Nakkar became clear that Catholics oppose the argument is much more difficult than he thought before , a special impression made on him , given evidence from the writings of Saint Ephrem the Syrian , one of the most revered Jacobite saints .
Matthew Nakkar asked the monks permission to use their library to prepare arguments .
The study of the Fathers of the Church in the monastery library , as well as discussions with the monks have led to the fact that on November 27 , 1832 in the Catholic Church of Aleppo , it was in March of that which Matthew has not long been trying to close , he was admitted to the Syriac Catholic Church by Patriarch Ignatius Peter VII Jarweh . From Aleppo Matthew went directly to Mardin - the main stronghold of Jacobites .
Here , as a result of his preaching of Catholicism converted 54 people .
On hearing this , the patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church denounced him to the Turkish authorities , accusing Matthew in getting to the Pope of gold , with which he allegedly persuaded Jacobites to the adoption of Catholicism and refusing to obey the Sultan .
By order of the Governor Nakkar was captured and imprisoned , and later he was sent to the Jacobite Monastery , where he held two weeks in an empty tank , starved and beaten regularly , claiming to renounce Catholicism and curse the Council of Chalcedon .
Two weeks later , the exhausted Matthew was taken to a hut outside the monastery , hoping that he would die there .
But the next morning heard the groans of Bishop passing by the daughter of the leader of local Kurds , who told his servants to break down the door and moved to his home dying .
Having recovered his freedom , Matthew returned to his preaching , through which the end of the year joined to the Catholic Church the Jacobite Metropolitan of Mardin .
In 1835 he became bishop in the newly formed Diocese of Nabq and Cariati .
In this position he remained for 33 years until his death .
During this time his diocese joined tens of thousands of Jacobites , together with them , he experienced fellow Maronite war and related anti-Christian pogroms . Matthew Nakkar died on 22 March 1868 and his grave is in the Syro-Catholic Patriarchal Monastery in Sharfeh , on the territory of Lebanon . Dmitry Lialin .

Puzzle &amp; amp ; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; is a match-three puzzle game , requiring players to move and match colored orbs arranged in a grid .
The amount and type of matches determine which of the six monsters on the player &amp; apos ; s team attack the waves of enemy monsters and how much damage they do .
An additional layer of challenge is the acquisition , selection , and improvement of a team of monsters from among thousands ranging from standard fantasy fare , to deities from several religions and mythologies and characters from popular entertainment franchises . The game is free-to-play and financed by the sale of in-game currency .
It is a commercial success in Japan , where it was downloaded 32 million times by November 2014 , and was released in other Asian countries as well as in North America and many European countries .
In September 2015 , total worldwide downloads surpassed 50 million .
&amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; is the first mobile game in history to gross $ 1billion in revenue , eventually grossing $ 6billion in total by the end of 2017 .
The game has spawned a franchise consisting of several video games as well as an anime series &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons X &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; is a combination of two types of gameplay : tile matching and a monster collecting RPG .
Players create teams by picking from the over 3000 different monsters they can acquire within the game and then play dungeons where they solve a tile-matching puzzle that determines how powerful their monsters &amp; apos ; attacks are on waves of enemy monsters . The monsters in &amp; quot ; PAD &amp; quot ; are drawn from many origins .
Their designs range from fantasy creatures such as dragons , demons , ogres , and goblins , to monsters based on deities and other figures of various mythologies around the world ; also included are third party fictional characters available for limited periods of time .
Players collect these monsters as rewards for completing the game &amp; apos ; s dungeons or spending in-game currency ( either won through gameplay or purchased ) at the &amp; quot ; Egg Machines &amp; quot ; . The various statistics different monsters possess add to the strategic nature of the game .
One monster on the team is designated as the &amp; quot ; Leader &amp; quot ; , and will have a passive leader skill that affects either the offensive or defensive abilities of the player &amp; apos ; s team throughout play in a dungeon .
In addition , nearly all monsters also possess active skills that the player can use to their advantage in play , but these possess a cooldown timer , which requires the player to take several turns before being able to use the skill .
During play , the player also picks a monster from other players to add to their party .
Prior to version 7 . 4 . 1 , only the player &amp; apos ; s friends would have their leader skill activated and &amp; quot ; adventurers &amp; quot ; could only be chosen to possibly become friends after ; version 7 . 4 . 1 makes the &amp; quot ; adventurer &amp; quot ; players &amp; apos ; monsters have leader skills active as well .
Players are limited to what monsters they can use on their teams based on their rank and the monster &amp; apos ; s associated team cost which is based on the monster &amp; apos ; s rarity and strength .
When the player increases his or her player rank through completing dungeons and earning experience points , the total team cost is increased , as well .
Players can save multiple teams to use in the game , starting out at six possible combinations to set up .
Teams can be tailored to defeat a particular dungeon , or be set up to best utilize the team &amp; apos ; s leader skill . Monsters are made more powerful through fusing them with others , which increases the selected monster &amp; apos ; s experience .
If the two monsters possess the same skill , there is a chance that the base monster &amp; apos ; s skill level will be increased , which will lower the skill &amp; apos ; s cooldown counter permanently .
Certain monsters won in the game also are marked with a plus ( + ) sign and a number , which indicates that they have a statistic that is increased in comparison to identical monsters ; using these monsters in fusion passes on the increased statistic to the base monster .
Once a monster reaches a set maximum level , the monster can be evolved , so long as the player possesses other monsters required for that particular monster &amp; apos ; s evolution .
Evolution resets the monster &amp; apos ; s level back to 1 , but it also allows for the monster &amp; apos ; s statistics to be increased through leveling once more .
An &amp; quot ; Ultimate Evolution &amp; quot ; mechanic was added to the game in its update to version 4 . 0 , which can change a monster &amp; apos ; s various statistics around , changing how that monster can be used strategically in dungeons .
The update to version 6 . 0 added the Awoken Skill system , adding additional passive skills that all monsters on a team have active in dungeon play . The puzzle system in &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; is found within the game &amp; apos ; s dungeons , where the play of a tile-matching puzzle determines the strength of the player &amp; apos ; s monsters &amp; apos ; attacks .
Dungeons consist of certain numbers of waves of enemy monsters , each with their own offensive and defensive statistics .
The player must clear all of the dungeon &amp; apos ; s floors without having their team &amp; apos ; s collective HP drop to zero .
The game screen is split , with the enemy monsters appearing on the top half of the screen , and a 6-by-5 tile grid appearing on the bottom , divided by the player &amp; apos ; s own team of monsters . Dungeon encounters are played out in a turn-based style .
The player &amp; apos ; s turn consists of activating any skills from the monsters on their team if they are available , and then attempting to make a match ( or &amp; quot ; combo &amp; quot ; ) of three or more tiles ( or &amp; quot ; orbs &amp; quot ; ) on the board .
The orbs are of the five colors representing the elemental attributes of the monsters ( Fire , Wood , Water , Light , and Dark ) as well as hearts that represent life recovery ( certain enemy monster skills may introduce two other types of orbs to the board ) .
The player drags an orb to adjacent positions , swapping with the orb already there .
So long as the player does not let go of the orb , the player can move the orb as much as necessary within 4 seconds ( unless changed by a player or enemy monsters &amp; apos ; skills ) once they start moving it , allowing them to arrange for several combos in a single turn .
After completing this , all matched orbs are removed from the board and accounted for as damage .
The board then cascades all orbs down and fills the board up once more ; this may result in more combos , known as . Damage is based on what colors were matched in the combos : for example , a basic combo of 3 red ( Fire ) orbs will have any player monster that is Fire attribute deal its damage equal to its base attack stat ( ATK ) to one creature .
When heart orbs are matched in a combo , this restores health to the team based on the team &amp; apos ; s total health recovery stat ( RCV ) .
Combos of more than 3 orbs of the same color will increase the damage dealt for each additional orb .
Making multiple combos in the same turn will boost all damage or healing for all monsters regardless of colors matched , while separate combos of the same color further multiply the damage dealt .
Single combos of five or more orbs will activate an attack that hits all enemy monsters on the field .
Certain Leader or Awoken Skills may also change damage dealt , so long as the particular parameters are met .
Damage is dealt to a single monster , generally determined by the game as the best attack .
Damage will be affected by both the opposing monsters &amp; apos ; defense statistic and its elemental attribute , so fire damage against an opposing fire monster will work , but will be boosted against a wood monster and decreased against a water monster , and so forth in a rock-paper-scissors relationship ; light and dark monsters are solely weak to the other type .
The player can force damage to go against a specific monster by tapping it on the screen .
After the player finishes their turn , a counter on each of the enemy monsters drops by one .
If one of these counters gets to zero , that monster is given a turn to attack , and the counter resets to a predefined value .
If a player does not end a turn on a successful match , the enemy monsters &amp; apos ; attack counter advances once while any cool down timers for the player do not change ( statuses imposed by enemy monsters are affected , though ) . When an enemy monster &amp; apos ; s HP drops to zero , the monster drops out from battle , and there is a chance that it will leave a monster egg or treasure chest behind that will be part of the dungeon &amp; apos ; s reward .
Once all monsters in an encounter are defeated , the player moves to the next encounter until reaching the boss encounter for that floor .
Once the boss is defeated , the player earns the various rewards earned throughout the dungeon .
If the player &amp; apos ; s team &amp; apos ; s HP drops to zero , they have the option to use in-game currency to continue from where they just lost , refilling their HP and resetting the entire board , or to abandon the dungeon and forego any gains from it .
Completing a dungeon earns the player experience , as well as in-game currency and any monster eggs that were obtained through the encounters .
Once all of the floors in a dungeon are completed , the next dungeon is unlocked . The game features several types of dungeons that the player chooses to participate in .
All dungeons have an associated Stamina cost , which is based on the player &amp; apos ; s rank in the game ; this cost is scaled to the dungeon &amp; apos ; s difficulty , and if the player does not have enough stamina , they must wait until it is restored in real time or use an in-game currency to restore it .
At the start , only the Normal Dungeons are available to the player .
Enemy monsters in these dungeons will only ever cause standard damage during gameplay .
After successful completion of a series of the Normal Dungeons , the Technical Dungeons ( added in version 3 . 0 ) are unlocked .
Technical Dungeons are more difficult , as enemy monsters now possess their own skills to increase their damage output or change the player &amp; apos ; s board by changing colors , obscuring the view , or adding the block and poison orbs that are unique to enemy monster skills .
Some Technical Dungeons also impose restrictions on the player , such as restricting what monsters the player can use or deactivating all monsters &amp; apos ; passive skills .
After successfully clearing a series of the Technical Dungeons , a new &amp; quot ; Challenge Mode &amp; quot ; is unlocked , where the player creates a team from friends &amp; apos ; monsters , relying on only their own monster &amp; apos ; s leader skill . Also in play are Special Dungeons , which have limited periods of availability and often feature the strongest and rarest monsters in the game .
Special Dungeons have their own separate difficulty scaling ; the rarer monsters are less likely to be won from the easier difficulty dungeons , whereas completion of the highest difficulty ranking almost ensures winning the dungeon &amp; apos ; s boss .
A recent addition to the Special Dungeons is a system that scores the player based on their dungeon performance and team make up and awards the player an additional rare monster for achieving a high score .
Added to the version 7 . 2 update are &amp; quot ; Coin Dungeons &amp; quot ; , Special Dungeons that the player can purchase with the in-game coin currency for one hour at a time , including several new Dungeons and new monsters only accessible in revamped dungeons .
The Challenge Dungeon was also added to the game , appearing for limited times and offering prizes for successfully clearing increasingly difficult floors of the dungeon .
A recent update added new Dungeons with roguelike gameplay , allowing players to challenge series of monsters , their own team levelling up along the way , to win monsters and in-game currency . There are also ranking Dungeons , it appears as a special event and lasts for one week .
Sometimes you will be given a team or you have to make a team for yourself .
Finish the Ranking Dungeons with the time limit 300 seconds and get scores according to the performance you did in the dungeons .
All players will compete for higher score .
Certain rank will be given certain prices .
Players that reach top 3 % of the rank will be given a crown that can be placed next to your character name . &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; features multiple types of in-game currencies that the player uses for various purposes .
The most versatile are the Magic Stones .
Players are awarded Magic Stones for completing dungeons for the first time ( or for the first time through Challenge Mode ) , or they can be purchased through the in-game store .
Magic Stones are used to increase the capacity of the player &amp; apos ; s monster inventory , restore stamina to full capacity , increase the capacity of the player &amp; apos ; s friend list ( after a certain level ) , and continue play in a dungeon if the player lost all HP .
However , they are also used as payment for the Egg Machines , where the player can win rarer monsters .
Players often save up Magic Stones for special server events where the rarer monsters have an increased payout at the Rare Egg Machine .
These are split between Galas for single elemental types , Carnivals for themed sets of monsters , or the Godfests where the game &amp; apos ; s rarest God type monsters have increased payout .
While these rare monsters can be obtained at any time from the Rare Egg Machine , there are monsters that can only be obtained during the Godfests . Pal Points are an additional form of currency found in the game , which is awarded for participating in dungeons with other players .
These are spent at the Pal Egg Machine , which usually does not award the player rare monsters , unless there is an event to make some rarer monsters more readily available from the Pal Egg Machine .
Coins , along with experience points and monster eggs , are awarded to the player for completing dungeons .
Coins are required for fusing monsters together , either for experience or evolution .
They are also used to purchase access to the Coin Dungeons , which gives the player a chance to play certain time limited Special Dungeons or play new versions of dungeons with higher difficulties to attempt to win new rare monsters exclusive to the Coin Dungeons . Most recently a new type of currency , Monster Points ( MP ) , have been added to the game .
These points can be obtained by selling monsters , where higher rarity monsters sell for more Monster Points .
These points can be spent at the special Monster Point Shop to buy Evolution Materials , Tamadras , Latent Tamadras , and other rare monsters unobtainable from the Rare Egg Machine . &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; is also known for its collaboration events with several other video games and anime properties .
During collaborations , Special Dungeons and special Collaboration Egg Machines are added to the game which contain monsters that can otherwise never be obtained again .
The more common monsters won through the collaboration dungeons will possess the same skills as standard monsters , making them sought after for increasing monster skill levels .
Most of the collaborations are exclusive to the Japanese edition of the game , but many have been released to the international editions .
The collaborations are as follows ( in chronological order as they were added to the Japanese edition of the game ) : is a spin-off application made available for a few times between 2013 and 2014 .
Players of &amp; quot ; PAD Challenge &amp; quot ; must use a set team of supplied monsters to defeat a series of powerful monsters within a 5-minute time limit . In a future update to the standard &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; app , &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons Challenge &amp; quot ; will be further integrated , with players able to use their own designed teams to play against other players &amp; apos ; teams for Pal Points , effectively creating customized dungeons . On July 29 , 2014 , the Japanese edition of &amp; quot ; PAD &amp; quot ; updated to version 7 . 0 . 0 and with the update came , a second game packaged with the normal &amp; quot ; PAD &amp; quot ; .
It primarily features the TAMADRA monster from &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; , and tells the story of how their eggs , eggs containing clothing bestowed upon them by the other monsters , were stolen by the evil King DeviTAMA for his own use .
The AvaTAMA pieces are the primary collectibles in &amp; quot ; PADW &amp; quot ; , instead of monsters . Gameplay in &amp; quot ; PADW &amp; quot ; is similar to that in the standard game .
Players spend stamina points to begin levels where they are given a certain amount of time to move a single orb around the puzzle board to make combos in order to perform damage on the enemy .
However , the game is geared more towards the puzzle aspect than the RPG elements of &amp; quot ; PAD &amp; quot ; .
The board in &amp; quot ; PADW &amp; quot ; is a 6-by-6 grid , and instead of monsters the player has a TAMADRA avatar that he or she customizes with the collected AvaTAMA hats , handheld items , and shell decorations .
Each AvaTAMA activates different skills that the player can use on a puzzle , which is activated when the player touches a special skill star orb that appears on the board .
Skills usually either change the color of orbs on the board or clears orbs such as in a line across the board , but there are skills that deal damage or give the player free movement for a period of time .
Like in the regular game , players also pick a friend or explorer and their TAMADRA avatar and AvaTAMA pieces assist the player in completing the puzzles .
New types of orbs have been added : rainbow-colored W orbs that act as wild cards for any three matches made with it , the white Angel orbs ( included at launch ) , and the black Devil orbs ( added in a later update ) .
Jammer orbs have been changed to fill up the board where they cannot be matched , but can be removed if another nearby line is cleared ; purple Jammer orbs multiply on the board if not cleared . In order to perform damage to the enemy DeviTAMAs , the player must meet a certain goal for that level &amp; apos ; s puzzles .
These take the form of requiring a particular color or set of colors be matched in a single turn , that a certain number of combos be made in a single turn , that a particular number of orbs be matched in a single combo , or any combination of the three .
Players are given a limited number of turns per area ( instead of dungeons ) to reach these goals , but turns can be restored by matching heart orbs .
Once all of the DeviTAMA enemies have been defeated , the player wins the level , and is then shown their score based on the number of turns left and their average number of combos .
This score is then graded from one to three stars , and then awarded the contents of any AvaTAMA eggs and treasure chests that the enemies dropped .
If the AvaTAMA are duplicates of what the player already owns , the item is leveled up instead of taking up inventory space .
Treasure chests award the player medals , a new form of in-game currency .
The next stage is unlocked once the player has a minimum of 4 stars for a single stage &amp; apos ; s three areas , but this doesn &amp; apos ; t require that all three areas be cleared .
Clearing the third area is usually more difficult and requires more stamina , but finishing it for the first time restores the player &amp; apos ; s stamina and either awards a greater quantity of medals or a Magic Stone , which is carried over to the standard &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; account . As in the regular game , players can use Magic Stones to restore stamina , continue dungeons where the turns ran out , and increase the friend list capacity .
The medals earned in the game go towards the &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons W &amp; quot ; version of the Egg Machine .
While single common items can be won with a fairly low number of medals spent , rarer items cost more medals and the rarest items can only be won if playing a multiple item spin . &amp; quot ; PADW &amp; quot ; has also featured limited edition collaboration AvaTAMA pieces , first with the band Arashi and later with &amp; quot ; Detective Conan &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; Puzzle and Dragons Radar &amp; quot ; is an accessory app for &amp; quot ; Puzzle and Dragons &amp; quot ; meant to add augmented reality functionality with GPS support to the main game .
It is available only in Japan .
The app can be linked to the player &amp; apos ; s Puzzle and Dragons account .
By playing through the &amp; quot ; Radar &amp; quot ; game , the player can collect orbs by walking around and exploring .
The orbs can be redeemed for items and monsters in &amp; quot ; Puzzle and Dragons &amp; quot ; , including Tamadras , Piis , 1 hour dungeons , and many other prizes . The arcade game was released in collaboration with Square Enix on April 24 , 2014 .
Gameplay in &amp; quot ; Battle Tournament &amp; quot ; is similar to the mobile game .
The player uses a team of monsters and solves a tile-matching puzzle to determine how powerful their monsters &amp; apos ; attacks are , and can activate their monsters &amp; apos ; active skills during play for various effects and choose one monster to serve as team leader to use the passive leader skill .
However , several changes were made to suit the arcade version , which uses the NESiCA smart card to save playing data for individual players .

Prior to &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; release , GungHo had primarily been involved in assisting in computer and console games from its formation in 2002 , including &amp; quot ; Ragnarok Online &amp; quot ; .
The company &amp; apos ; s founder and CEO , Kazuki Morishita , found that the quality of their games had started to diminish , and moved more of his time over into the creative development department , and guided the company towards mobile gaming around 2010 .
Prior to &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; release , they had already published about ten games . The idea for &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; came about around August 2011 , according to Morishita .
They observed that at that time , card battle games were popular mobile applications in Japan , though Morishita felt most of the titles were not great .
They worked to craft a new type of card battle game , combining gameplay genres such as the tile-matching puzzle aspects and role-playing game exploration .
After about a month , they recognized they had the core of the game down , and subsequently a team of six developers completed work on the title over the next six months . Though they desired to release the game simultaneously for both iOS and Android , their small team size required them to stagger the releases .
Using the Unity game engine , they developed natively on the iOS and then added more developers comfortable with the Unity engine to help port the Android version .
The game was first released on iOS platform in Japanese markets on February 20 , 2012 without any advertising , and had topped the app charts within a few days .
When they released the Android version on September 18 , 2012 , GungHo opted to employ television spots to promote the title since it was now available on both platforms .
The Android version tops its charts within a week and a half of going live .
English and Korean versions of the game were released about half a year after the success in Japan .
GungHo released the title as a free-to-play app , with players able to spend money to continue to explore dungeons after depleting their stamina or being defeated in a dungeon , to collect more monsters , or to attempt to get rare monsters from a random draw .
Morishita said they found that as players became accustomed to the gain , their spending habits switched from getting continued dungeon exploration toward obtaining more and rarer monsters . According to Morishita , in 2014 about forty developers and artists are working on the title , with nearly half of those focused on continuing updates and art assets .
The game has developed some new modes such as challenge mode , technical dungeons , and a new ranking system in certain dungeons where the player is awarded points based on overall combo number , rarity , cost , and more . GungHo has announced that &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; will cease support for devices with operating systems lower than iOS 6 and Android Ice Cream Sandwich ( 4 . 0 ) in December 2014 in Japan and in spring 2015 for North America and Europe .

A soundtrack containing Ito &amp; apos ; s contributions was released on April 3 , 2013 , via the iTunes Store .
Ito was also the composer for &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons Z &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons : Battle Tournament &amp; quot ; ; Kohei Tanaka also participated in the composition of the &amp; quot ; Battle Tournament &amp; quot ; soundtrack . &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; won a CEDEC Game Design award in 2012 . The game also has a series of official merchandise in Japan , sold at AppBank Store locations as well as through an official &amp; quot ; Puzzle &amp; amp ; Dragons &amp; quot ; online store .
Items sold include phone cases , phone straps , books , plush toys , figurines , and even snack foods also sold at Japanese grocery stores .
Other video games for handheld consoles and video arcades have also been released in Japan , as well as merchandise only available from claw cranes . As of April 2013 , it is the # 1 grossing app in the world on iOS and Android .

enticing players to spend more and more money ) .
Judiciary reform in Peru under Alberto FujimoriThe State of the Judiciary Under Fujimori isDuring the presidency of Alberto Fujimori ( 1990- 2002 ) the Judiciary branch of Peru faced many reforms that the president enacted as a way to fulfill his campaign against terrorism .
The reforms consisted of taking jurisdiction of terrorism cases away from civilian courts , changes in the structure of the court systems , and changes in the training of magistrates .
These changes were implemented with popular support , however they also received much criticism from the legal establishment and the international community . Before the election of Fujimori , Peru was deeply affected by terrorism and the Judiciary branch of the country was enveloped with corruption and bureaucracy .
By the elections of 1990 it was obvious that fighting terrorism with the state of that institution was going to be difficult because of the sluggish pace of the institution and also the low rate of convictions of those accused of terrorism ; under a 10 % conviction rate .
For this reason during his inaugural speech Fujimori promised to reform the Judiciary . During the first two years of his administration there were few changes to the Judiciary .
This was a result of the opposition controlling congress and the Judiciary was reluctant to changes .
To achieve his goals of reform he performed an “ auto-coup ” which resulted in the temporary suspension of congress , Judiciary , and also the constitution .
At this point , using his presidential power of decree , he started to adopt laws and regulations pertaining to the trials of suspected terrorists and also the structure and functioning of the Judiciary .
One of the first things he did was to send suspected terrorist to be tried on military tribunals .
He made this move as a result of outrage in the country over judges “ granting terrorists more than 200 early releases from prison a year ” .
Corrupt judges were also known for dramatically reducing the sentences of convicted terrorist .
By taking terrorism cases away from them he was able to achieve faster and harsher sentences for terrorist .
The military tribunals were done in secret to protect the military judges from threats or bribing .
This of course , had the down side of lacking transparency and seeming anti-democratic .
However , to this Fujimori responded pointing the approval of this changes and asked people to respect the “ popular will ” . To fight corruption in the Judiciary , under the “ Emergency Government of National Reconstruction ” , he adopted measures of harsh punishments to penalize corrupt Judges and Prosecutors .
It is important to note that this decree also targeted judges who were guilty of “ political favoritism ” , a measure adopted to deal with judges who were known for favoring opposition leaders .
Another major aspect of his reform was Law 26623 .
This controversial law , which was approved by congress in a cloudy manner , created the Council of Judicial Coordination .
This body had full power to reorganize the judiciary in coordination with other organizations of the state .
The aim of this law was to achieve more coordination amongst the different establishments within the Judiciary .
The law also handed control over the Academy of the Magistrates to the new council .
This was extremely controversial since this academy was responsible for the training of Judges , so legal experts saw it as a move by the executive to control and politicize the Judiciary . Fujimori was elected thanks to anti-establishment feelings .
Right before the auto-coup the Peruvian congress , which had been stalling the reforms offered by the newly elected president , had an anemic approval rating of 17 % compared to Fujimori ’ s 42 % at that same time .
For this reason his assault against the establishment was widely supported , resulting in a jump in post-coup approval rating to 81 % .
One poll showed that the reorganization of the Judiciary enjoyed 95 % approval and only 2 % disapproval .
Months after the coup , thanks to some of the policies adopted post-coup , Abimael Guzman , the leader of Shining Path , was captured and successfully tried .
This increased support for his policies even more .
Released cables from the US embassy show the concerns of US diplomats in Peru who stated : “ the Guzman arrest- &amp; # 91 ; has &amp; # 93 ; muted opposition criticism of his efforts to reconfigure Peru ’ s suspended institutions and enhance his executive authority ” .
Fujimori and his policies were widely popular in Peru up till the bitter end when he fled the country early in his third term because of the corruption and kidnapping charges that were brought against him . Once the auto-coup took place , Fujimori started governing by mainly using decrees .
This was criticized for being undemocratic , and his coup and manner of reforms received international condemnation .
His reforms in the Judiciary were seen as an effort to increase presidential influence over that branch of government .
International legal experts also claim that the changes “ deprive the accused of a fair trial ” .
Human rights organizations strongly condemned his administration and many called for the release of suspected terrorist , whom they claimed were being wrongly accused and held .

The calendar is the brainchild of a group composed mostly of Orthodox eastern Europeans of the former region .
The primary goal was to create the very first organized global effort against homophobia in the Orthodox region and counteract prejudice against the LGBT community .
&amp; quot ; The goal is to show that Orthodox believers do not necessarily fit into the stalls as the press make of them .

This edition pays tribute to LGBT people in Russia and was born from the collaboration between OC ’ s Art Director and Hungarian artist Tienne coming back from Russia . The calendar and videos have 12 nude and semi-nude photos of persons portrayed as Orthodox priests and their guests .
The style – with bold colors , homoerotic undertones and gentle ironic humor – appears to be inspired in part by the works of David LaChapelle and Pierre &amp; amp ; Gillesas the creators of the calendar compare the concept of their work .
Photo sessions and casting took place in the predominantly Orthodox area of eastern Europe . Photo sessions and casting took place in the predominantly Orthodox area of eastern Europe .

MOWAG-AEGIn cooperation with AEG built MOWAG 37 aircraft tug named Flz Sch 4x2 for the Swiss Air Force .
The vehicles were used primarily to move the Dassault Mirage IIIS and Mirage III RS in and out of the aircraft caverns .
A special feature compared to other aircraft tugs ( e . g .
Bucher aircraft tractor ) was that in these , the aircraft could be suspended during the journey of the towing hook to keep the time between leaving the cavern and the lift off of the Mirage short .
The Mirage began immediately upon leaving the &amp; quot ; Vorstollens &amp; quot ; to start their engine .
Once the engine was running , the latch was released by the tractor driver and he drove from the plane away and turned to the right , so the Mirage freely under its own power could roll on the taxiway to the runway .
The aircraft tractors were in use from 1967 to 2003 by the Swiss Air Force .

Zacharias Mar AthanasiosZachariah Mar Athanasios born Cherian Polachirackal ( 19 February 1909 in Tiruvalla , India – 29 September 1977 in Tiruvalla ) , was a Saint Thomas Christian Syro-Malankara Catholic Bishop of Tiruvalla .
Cherian Polachirackal was born to an aristocratic Saint Thomas Christian family Polachirackal within the erst-while Indian princely state of Travancore currently in the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala .
He is a son of the aristocratic Saint Thomas Christian family with their tharavad in Mavelikkara .
The Polachirackal House held the highest-ranking hereditary title for a Christian family in Travancore being of nobility titled as Tharakan and were of the highest ranking Christian peer to the Maharaja of Travancore .
The Polachirackal House through the Saint Thomas Christian Syro-Malankara Catholic Church is acknowledged by Pope Pius XI and continues to do so by the Holy See of the Vatican City as one of the oldest Saint Thomas Christian families with their tradition of origin being that their ancestors who were of a royal lineage from the Chera Dynasty were converted by Saint Thomas in 53 AD and preceding Western Christianity and Christian monarchies in Europe .
Starting with the first Portuguese discoveries including that of navigator Vasco da Gama , the House had evolved from accumulating one of the largest wealth through merchant trading from their oligopoly in black pepper commodity trading as part of the spice trade controlled by the Dutch East India during the age of discovery between the 16th and 18th centuries .
The House &amp; apos ; s excessive wealth allowed them to become the court financiers to Marthanda Varma and financed the Kingdom of Venad during the Travancore – Dutch War in the 18th century against the Dutch East India Company .
This culminated in funding the Battle of Colachel in 1741 leading to Marthanda Varma defeating of the Dutch East India Company which was the first loss of its kind by a European naval super-power in the Indian sub-continent .
The House were signatories to the Treaty of Mavelikkara in 1753 contributing to the establishment of the Kingdom of Travancore , diminishing the role of the Dutch East India Company in the Indian subcontinent and leading to the rise of the Maharaja of Travancore Marthanda Varma and the Travancore Royal Family .
Athanasios was born into a Jacobite Orthodox family on 19 February 1909 in Tiruvalla .
He later converted to Catholicism .
Athanasios was ordained a priest on 24 August 1946 .
On 31 December 1953 he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop .
His consecration took place on 22 April 1954 .
On 27 January 1955 , after the death of his predecessor , Joseph Mar Severios , he was appointed Bishop .
He died on 29 September 1977 .

Artyom SukhanovArtyom Fyodorovich Sukhanov ( ; born May 25 , 1989 ) is a Russian football forward , who last played for FC Vologda .
Karl Spindler ( naval officer ) Karl Spindler ( 1887-1951 ) was a German Naval Officer who was involved in an attempt to bring German arms ashore in Ireland on behalf of Irish rebels as part of the Easter Rising of 1916 . Spindler was born in the small town of Königswinter , near Cologne , Germany on 29 May 1887 , the son of a quarry owner , Hubert Spindler and his wife Elise ( née Fuchs ) .
At an early age Spindler decided to go to sea rather than join the family business , serving for a period as a watch officer on a Lloyd line steamship .
He subsequently enlisted in the marine school in Bremen and the naval academy in Sonderburg , then part of Germany .
He served on several ships of the German Imperial Navy and at the outbreak of the Great War , he was commanding the Polarstern , a guardship for the port of Wilhelmshaven . On 20 March 1916 Spindler was given instructions by his senior officer to undertake a highly secret and dangerous mission on board a disguised merchant ship and to pick five officers and a crew of 16 to join him on the journey .
He was given command of a vessel named &amp; quot ; Libau &amp; quot ; , a captured British vessel formerly named &amp; quot ; Castro &amp; quot ; and informed that it was to be falsely flagged as a Norwegian freighter and carry a cargo of weapons to the West Coast of Ireland along with a passenger , Sir Roger Casement .
It was part of a plan to land German arms in Ireland to assist Irish republicans in staging what would become the 1916 Rising .
Spindler travelled to Berlin for further orders and met Casement there .
However Casement preferred to travel on board a submarine which would accompany the &amp; quot ; Libau &amp; quot ; which was to be renamed the &amp; quot ; Aud &amp; quot ; , the name of a real Norwegian ship , once it went to sea .
Casement was later put ashore at Banna Strand in Co .
Kerry from the submarine by means of a small collapsible boat .
However Casement was arrested soon afterwards on Good Friday , 21 April 1916 , and taken prisoner in the Tower of London on charges of High Treason against the United Kingdom .
He was subsequently executed by hanging at Pentonville Prison on 3 August 1916 .
The uprising had failed .
Meanwhile , Spindler &amp; apos ; s ship , now renamed the &amp; quot ; Aud &amp; quot ; , was intercepted by British naval vessels near the Blasket Islands and forced to sail for Cobh ( then known as Queenstown ) where the British had a major naval base .
However Spindler instructed his crew to open the ship &amp; apos ; s sea-valves and blow an explosive charge in the hold .
As they left the sinking ship the crew took down the false Norwegian flag she was flying and hoisted the German Imperial flag in its place .
They then left the vessel on board two dinghies and were taken prisoners by the British .
After some questioning they were taken as prisoners of war to Donington Hall .
From there they later escaped only to be recaptured the following day .
Spindler was in a weakened state after several bouts of ill-health , and in a prisoner exchange shortly before the end of the war he was transferred to the Netherlands .
He subsequently travelled to the United States where he went on a lecture tour speaking of his ill-fated trip to Ireland and his connections with the Easter Rising .
In 1921 Spindler published a book on the &amp; quot ; Aud &amp; quot ; episode which was translated into English as &amp; quot ; The mystery of the Casement ship &amp; quot ; or &amp; quot ; The Mystery Ship &amp; quot ; and had significant sales and was translated into several languages .
He was feted by Irish-American groups in the US and received numerous awards . Although he made several returns to Germany to see his family , Spindler remained in the United States for the rest of his life .
During World War II he was detained in an internment camp as an enemy alien as he failed to get permanent residency or naturalization in the US .
He was released in poor health at the end of that war .
Karl Spindler died on 29 November 1951 in Bismarck , North Dakota .

Losing Our SonsLosing Our Sons is a 2012 American documentary film produced by Americans for Peace and Tolerance , a Boston-based education non-profit company .
A . R .
Maezav is its executive producer , director and co-writer ; and Ilya I Feoktistov is its producer , co-director , and co-writer .
The film was edited by Brian Keith .
&amp; quot ; Losing Our Sons &amp; quot ; tells of two American families whose lives intersected through a shattering act of violence . &amp; quot ; Losing Our Sons &amp; quot ; was created as an educational tool for the public , meant to expose the threat to American civil society posed by Islamic extremism and the failure of American leadership to protect the public from this threat . Two fathers have lost their sons to a radical Islamist movement whose growth is enabled by naïve and misguided political correctness , willful ignorance , and simple cowardice .
Carlos Bledsoe , born and raised in an African American Baptist family , firebombed a rabbi &amp; apos ; s house and then killed Pvt .
Andy Long outside an Army recruiting office in Little Rock , Arkansas .
Carlos becomes a jihadist through his connections to radical mosques and Imams in Nashville , as part of a problem that is being ignored — or facilitated — by local civic and religious leaders and the media ; whose politically correct views blind Americans to a truth that few dare engage . The film documents the radical ideology preached in Nashville &amp; apos ; s universities and local mosques .
It contains actual sermons given by local Islamic leaders railing against Jews and Christians , as well as against American democracy .
This vividly contrasts with scenes of local Jewish and Christian leaders embracing these very same radical Imams , who pose as moderates but whose beliefs and teachings are unveiled for all to see .
The local newspaper , The Tennessean , which has been blinded by political correctness , publishes glowing reports about Islamic leaders while ignoring their easily found hate sermons , which are posted on the Internet for all to see . When Daris Long and Melvin Bledsoe try to explain to Congress what happened to their sons , they are met with a mix of hostility , indifference , and – from a few – sympathy .
Obama Administration officials are shown ducking and denying the Islamist problem , officiallycorrupting our language and terminology by restricting terminology describing radical Islam , so that reality cannot be accurately conveyed – all for the sake of not &amp; quot ; offending &amp; quot ; or inciting Muslims .
Melvin Bledsoe ’ s warning to congress pithily describes the Administration &amp; apos ; s confusion : &amp; quot ; We &amp; apos ; re worried about stepping on their toes ; and they ’ re talking about stamping us out . &amp; quot ; The film ends with a final warning to America from Melvin Bledsoe : &amp; quot ; It happened to my sontoday , tomorrow , your son . &amp; quot ;

Oscar PuffinOscar Grosnez Corbière Claud Puffin , known as Oscar Puffin , is a television station mascot for ITV Channel Television .
Oscar was the star of the birthday greetings programme Puffin &amp; apos ; s Pla ( i ) ce and was the last remaining ITV regional mascot to have an on-screen presence .
His show was on television from 3 March 1963 until 15 September 2013 . He was born on the island of Burhou in the Channel Islands . To introduce Oscar Puffin to viewers , it was claimed that Oscar had been watching Channel Television since its inception in September 1962 and was concerned that there was no on-screen children &amp; apos ; s birthday club for Channel Islands children .
Oscar decided to start one himself , but was in the unfortunate situation of not possessing a name .
Therefore , a competition to name him was run in the Channel Islands local TV listing magazine , The Channel Viewer , during February 1963 .
There were several winners of the competition .
Christine Tongs from Guernsey chose the name &amp; apos ; Oscar &amp; apos ; , Caroline Romeril from Jersey chose the name &amp; apos ; Groznez &amp; apos ; and Ann Balshaw of Guernsey chose the names &amp; apos ; Corbière Claud &amp; apos ; . In September 2013 it was announced Puffin &amp; apos ; s Pla ( i ) ce would no longer be broadcast on TV and the last edition was broadcast on 15 September 2013 . Although Oscar no longer has his own show , he remains the mascot of the ITV regional service in the Channel Islands .
He does make occasional appearances both on TV &amp; amp ; online and regularly makes updates on Twitter that have a strong element of absurdity .

Samurai TaisenSamurai Taisen is set in an alternate universe of the warring states period in Japan where players assume their role as Ji-samurai .
Each player starts the game as the leader of a small , undeveloped village which they are required to develop in order to expand their lands .
The village can be developed by constructing new buildings and upgrading existing ones .
In order to defend their villages , players may also recruit troops both to defend and to attack other villages .
The player may expand their lands by establishing new villages , or by conquering other players &amp; apos ; villages .
Players can communicate with each other using in-game messages , and may join alliances for military and economic co-operation with other players . The game features two main resources : Rice and Coins in which are needed to develop villages , conduct researches , as well as to raise troops .
In order to obtain these resources , players are required to build mine and farmland .
Resources output can be increased by upgrading the mine and farmland .
Players can also obtain more resources by establishing new villages or raiding other villages . In order to defend their villages , players are required to train troops .
Each troop has attributes which determine its training time , attack power , defense power , speed and resource carrying capacity .
There are two main types of the troops : combat troops and special troops .
Combat troops have combat capabilities which allow them to defend , attack , or raid villages .
Special troops such as ninja , geisha , and komusō have special capabilities which allow them to spy on enemy villages , or to perform assassinations .
Troops can be trained at dojo . There is also a special unit known as a Taishō ( 大将 , &amp; quot ; boss &amp; quot ; or &amp; quot ; chief &amp; quot ; ) , which represents the players in game .
Taishō can equip items and explore dungeon .
They can also accompany an army .
Depending on their attributes , a hero may give an offensive or defensive bonus to the army that it accompanies . In &amp; quot ; Samurai Taisen &amp; quot ; there are four major forces : Date clan , Uesugi clan , Takeda clan , Oda clan .
Each of them has their own characteristics and strategical bonus .
The amount of strategical bonus depends on the current provinces that faction holds .
Players may choose to join one or not to join to stay independent as Ronin .
Factions provide players with daily quests , completing quests will increase the standings towards that faction .
Raising standing in a faction allows the player to access more valuable and harder quests . Players with embassy may form their own alliances .
An alliance allows its members to work together for mutual benefit , and also provides improved communication tools such as mass alliance-wide in-game messages as well as alliance private forum .
Members of alliance may not attack each other , and each of them will be notified whenever their allies are under attack .

Critical area ( computing ) In integrated circuit design , a critical area refers to the area of a circuit design wherein a particle of a particular size can cause a failure .
It measures the sensitivity of the circuit to a reduction in yield .
Peronosclerospora philippinensisCommonly known as Philippine downy mildew , this disease is caused by the species Peronosclerospora philippinensis of the fungal-like protist class Oomycetes , which also has members such as water molds and &amp; quot ; Phytophthora infestans &amp; quot ; , which caused the potato blight that led to the Great Irish famine . Its hosts are typically grasses , cultivated and wild sorghum , sugarcane , and maize found in most of South and Southeast Asia , including India , China , and the Philippines .
This disease results in reduced yield in crops , a withered appearance of the leaves , abortive reproductive structures , and a grayish down on the surfaces . Historically , there have been cases of epidemics in which the species infected cultivars of maize and sugarcane and decimated the populations , causing up to $ 23 million US dollars ’ worth of damage .
Because of this , the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has included Philippine downy mildew on its Plant Pathogen Select Agent List , being a pathogen that poses a great threat for American plants , both wild and cultivated . Philippine downy mildew was first briefly mentioned by Professor Baker of the College of Agriculture of the University of the Philippines in 1916 and then again in 1918 by Dr .
Reinking , also of the College of Agriculture .
His studies showed that the species had been present in the Philippines for more than 10 years already .
It was not until 1920 when William Weston named it as &amp; quot ; Sclerospora philippinensis &amp; quot ; in a report , marking its similarities to its close relative &amp; quot ; Sclerospora sacchari &amp; quot ; . It continued to be known as &amp; quot ; Sclerospora philippinensis &amp; quot ; until 1980 , when it was renamed &amp; quot ; Peronosclerospora philippinensis &amp; quot ; according to the shifts in the classification . Yearly , there are 1 to 2 citations in biological journals .
Research proves to be continual although scarce .
Because of its designation as a Select Agent , American scientists have difficulty in obtaining samples within the United States to study the disease .
In terms of gene sequences at GenBank of the National Center for Biotechnology Information , there are five , one complete sequence of an internal transcribed spacer and four partial sequences of internal transcribed spacers . Philippine downy mildew has been most studied on maize for its economic significance , but it shares similar symptoms with other hosts .
A characteristic chlorosis , which develops from the loss of chlorophyll , and the downiness that gives the genus its popular name , are the two most common symptoms .
The species also cause the growth of new leaves to be narrow and rigid , a stunting of shoots and roots , decreased production of pollen , and sterile and malformed ears .
Mycelium extends throughout the entire plant except for the roots . When the disease is transferred to a new host , there is a delay in virulence , known as parasitic fitness . In maize , the reproductive tassels are malformed .
The disease seems to stimulate growth while suppressing it in other areas of development : the anthers are atrophied while the female structure development is blocked .
The resulting pollen is hollow and wrinkled . Socioeconomically important hosts are &amp; quot ; Zea mays &amp; quot ; and the &amp; quot ; Saccharum &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Sorghum &amp; quot ; species due to their cultivation for crops and export .
Other species of interest are the &amp; quot ; Graminaea &amp; quot ; species and many of the &amp; quot ; Andropogon &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Bothriochloa &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Schizachyrium &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; Zea &amp; quot ; genera , which amounts to over 30 species .
Most of these species are common grasses .
Over 60 species , though , of the previously mentioned genera are resistant .
The susceptible &amp; quot ; Andropogon &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Bothriochloa &amp; quot ; species are significant because they are common across the United States , especially areas where corn is grown agriculturally , like Illinois . Infection by Philippine downy mildew results in a lack of viable reproductive structures and often earlier death .
In addition , the infected plant is more likely to be infected by a secondary pathogen , such as a species of &amp; quot ; Pythium &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Helminthosporium &amp; quot ; , or &amp; quot ; Fusarium &amp; quot ; . At the same time , when a section of the infected plant is transplanted to the soil , there is pronounced growth .
This action seems to be by influence of the fungus-like protist to produce a large-enough host capable of transmitting spores . Infection begins when conidia from nearby infected plants or those carried by the wind enter through the stomata by landing and developing a germ tube or hypha .
The conidia germinate optimally in the early morning and with a high relative humidity .
The haustoria extend from the hyphae of the mycelium and systemically invade the rest of the plant , draining nutrients . Eventually , from the stomata , hyphae extend out and elongate , branching into sterigmata or conidiophores ( spore-bearing structures ) .
These then asexually bud into conidium spores .
These structures create the characteristic grayish-white down-like appearance of downy mildew .
Unlike other oomycetes , or &amp; quot ; Peronosclerospora &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; is not known to produce oospores .
There is no known sexual stage of the life cycle for &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; . In dry seasons , there is low infection .
Maximum sporulation occurs in the late hours of the night and early morning , typically at 2-3AM with high humidity and moisture or dew .
The conidia are then spread via air currents or wind . Infection occurs most in the summer , peaking in July . Transmission via seeds occurs with infection in the pericarp . Philippine downy mildew can be found in China , India , Indonesia , Nepal , Pakistan , Thailand , and in the Philippines .
Currently , there are no known cases of the disease occurring within the United States . In Nepal , there was a large epidemic in 1967 , followed by a couple more in 1970 and 1973 .
A large epidemic in the Philippines from 1974-1975 devastated the national agricultural maize crop , costing the country millions in yield . There is limited information on diseases of &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; . Diagnosis as downy mildew can be characterized by the appearance of a down-like covering , the conidiophores , on the leaves , indicating a member of &amp; quot ; Peronosclerospora &amp; quot ; .
To discriminate between species , a closer examination must be followed .
Conidiophores of &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; are longer and thicken much less gradually for this disease than of other species of &amp; quot ; Peronosclerospora &amp; quot ; , and the conidia are also more elongated than the elliptical spores of &amp; quot ; P .
sacchari &amp; quot ; .
Spore size and shape are the most accurate method in differentiating between &amp; quot ; Peronosclerospora &amp; quot ; species . Drying seeds and limiting the amount of moisture that accumulates on seeds and plants is shown to control the development of the protist from infected seeds and young plants .
The preemptive use of systemic protectant fungicides prevents the progression of &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; .
Less sprayings in the dry season has proven to be more effective than more sprayings in the wet season .
Also , combining mineral oil with fungicide reduces yield loss while still being cost effective . An alternative method would be to limit secondary hosts , such as grasses and weeds . There have been many attempts to develop identify genes that code for resistance and to breed strains for those genes .
Studies show some progress , but the degree of gene dominance of the resistance and the inheritance is still questionable . The early application of fungicide to infected plants is the most common form of treatment .
Using fungicides that are systemic , like Apron 35 , which give protection within the plant , are the most reliable .
These can be applied in the soil to the roots or as a spray to be taken up via transpiration .
Other fungitoxicants , like Dithane M-45 and Dithane Z-78 , are also effective .
At high inoculation , the disease may be extended too systemically to be combatted . Corn is an important staple food for the world , especially for the Philippines , being the primary crop for 20 % of the population .
In the Philippine epidemic from 1974-1975 , Philippine downy mildew cost the nation 8 % of the total yield , accounting to 205,470 metric tons , or $ 22,601,700 .
Because of its high destruction and high percentages of infection , &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; threatens agriculture worldwide .
Funding has been focused on studies to identifying the minimal effective use of fungicide .
Other scientists have looked at inheritable resistance as a preventive effort or its effects on other crop exports , like sugarcane . As of 2010 , this disease is on the USDA APHIS Plant Pathogen Select Agent List .
There are provisions for the USDA to treat the introduction of &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; into the country as an act of bioterrorism because of the possible effect it could have on natural flora and on national agriculture .
Because of this status , there is currently no budget for studies of this disease in the United States . A number of experts on the disease are members of the U . S .
Department of Agriculture or are of Texas A &amp; amp ; M University .
Much research has been put into the phylogenetic relationship between &amp; quot ; P .
sacchari &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; .
Experiments have shown that of twenty-six species , only three species that can be infected by &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; show little infection by &amp; quot ; P .
sacchari &amp; quot ; .
This difference is minimalized when comparing host ranges of isolates of the same species .
One isolate of &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; can infect seven more than another .
There is no significant difference in the number of nuclei per spore for these two species , and they have almost identical banding patterns when analysed through a Southern blot .
When looking at their genomes , using simple sequence repeats as markers , there is shown to be lack of uniqueness between &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; P .
sacchari &amp; quot ; .
Because of these similarities , many scientists question that initial distinction that Weston placed on them in 1920 . More studies can be expected on a possible sexual stage as well as information on inherited resistance to &amp; quot ; P .
philippinensis &amp; quot ; in the host plants . The species can germinate in water and nutrient solutions , including those with 1 % agar .
In most experiments , isolates are extracted from the disease containment greenhouse or nursery .
The conidia are collected by washing the spores from leaves , and then filtered through a screen .
This solution is then sprayed onto the test plants which are incubated in dew chambers for 6 – 7 hours at about 21 ° C before they are moved to the laboratory .
Receiver ( video game ) Receiver is a first-person shooter video game developed by Wolfire Games .
The game attempts to portray realistic gun mechanics through a unique reloading system , where each step of reloading is assigned a different button .
The player scavenges items and audio tapes which reveal the story in an procedurally generated world . &amp; quot ; Receiver &amp; quot ; was released in June 2012 for Linux , Microsoft Windows , and Mac OS X .
In 2013 , the game is available as a free copy when purchasing the other Wolfire Games video game &amp; quot ; Overgrowth &amp; quot ; . In &amp; quot ; Receiver &amp; quot ; , players must search for eleven audio tapes from around a procedurally generated world , randomly arranged after each death .
Ammunition and flashlights are scattered throughout the world as well .
Players start with a random handgun , either a Smith &amp; amp ; Wesson Model 10 revolver , a Colt M1911A1 semi-automatic pistol , or a selective fire Glock 17 pistol with an automatic sear .
Players are also given a random inventory of ammunition and / or spare magazines for their weapon .
Players may also start with a flashlight .
While searching for tapes , the player will encounter stationary sentry turrets and mobile hover drones that will attack the player .
A single hit to the player will kill them .
Shooting these automated defenses can disable them , with shots to vital components , such as cameras , weapons , motor , or battery scoring significantly more damage .
If a player dies , they lose all progress and the game is reset with a new randomly-generated level layout , spawn position , and inventory . A core element of the game is how the player fires and reloads the handgun .
The gun has to be used in a semi-realistic fashion , meaning that all aspects of reloading the gun have to be enacted individually with different key presses .
Rather than finding magazines as seen in most shooters , the player finds cartridges which must be individually loaded into the revolver chambers or pistol magazines .
In-game actions mapped to individual key presses include , but are not limited to : removing the magazine from the pistol , inserting a cartridge into a magazine , inserting a magazine into the pistol , pulling back the slide , cocking the hammer , toggling the safety , inspecting the chamber , releasing the slide stop , and spinning the cylinder of the revolver .
To emphasize understanding of the firearm , the player &amp; apos ; s handgun will start in a random condition ; the magazine or chamber may be loaded or empty , the slide may be locked or unlocked , and the safety may be on or off . &amp; quot ; Receiver &amp; quot ; was originally created as part of the &amp; quot ; 7 Day FPS Challenge &amp; quot ; in 2012 , built on &amp; quot ; gun handling mechanics , randomized levels , and unordered storytelling . &amp; quot ; The game was released in June 2012 , and on Steam in April 2013 after being accepted as part of Steam Greenlight . The first content update for &amp; quot ; Receiver &amp; quot ; was released on September 3 , 2012 , and added a flashlight , a Smith &amp; amp ; Wesson Model 10 revolver , and a Glock 17 , among other features . The source code of the game is available since 2012 on GitHub under non-commercial license conditions . In Destructoid &amp; apos ; s 8 . 5 / 10 review , they said that &amp; quot ; successfully reloading a gun for the first time through sheer muscle memory is easily one of the greatest feelings in gaming &amp; quot ; , concluding that &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Receiver &amp; quot ; is one of those games that feels so incredibly satisfying once it is finally understood &amp; quot ; . The Verge described the game as &amp; quot ; wrapped up in a slick package that really makes you feel like a cool , infiltrating spy . &amp; quot ;

Food trends are often discussed in magazines devoted to cuisine , and around the internet . Although certain food trends may be more of a fad , some become long lasting and at times a permanent fixture in the culture of food .
In an article in &amp; quot ; Bon Appétit &amp; quot ; the difference between a food trend versus a fad is discussed .
David Saks , author of &amp; quot ; Tastemakers : Why were crazy for cupcakes but fed up with Fondue &amp; quot ; states , &amp; quot ; Think about extra virgin olive oil — with the gourmands it hit big in the late &amp; apos ; 70s , early &amp; apos ; 80s , and it trickled down to everyone else in the &amp; apos ; 90s .
It became the &amp; quot ; thing . &amp; quot ; Now it &amp; apos ; s not a trend , nobody really talks about it .
But it &amp; apos ; s the default oil .
It becomes a part of your eating culture .
Trends do that .
Fads don &amp; apos ; t . &amp; quot ; Authorities from &amp; quot ; Bon Appétit &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Food &amp; amp ; Wine &amp; quot ; magazines to the top chefs of the world have driven and reported on these trends .
For instance , &amp; quot ; Bon Appetit &amp; quot ; recently released their top 25 food trends for 2013 in their article &amp; quot ; The BA 25 : What to eat , drink , and cook in 2013 &amp; quot ; , Pinterest and Twitter give links to sites listing what to serve this season .
Pinterest is designed to display trends and food is one of their biggest categories . Smaller , blog-style sites have also appeared ; examples include &amp; quot ; Violas Pantry &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Mouth from the South &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; The Daily Meal &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; Spiced &amp; quot ; that recruit smaller numbers of readers and provide entertaining , colloquial content to more targeted audiences .

David B .
DusenberyDavid B .
Dusenbery is a biophysicist with a central interest in how information influences the behavior of organisms .
In later years , he also considered the physical constraints hydrodynamics imposes on microorganisms and gametes . He received his Bachelor of Arts in Physics from Reed College in 1964 and his PhD in Biophysics from the University of Chicago in 1970 .
Dusenbery was a postdoc at the California Institute of Technology 1970-1973 .
He was on the faculty of the Georgia Institute of Technology from 1973 to 2002 in Biology , with a joint appointment in Physics to 1978 . Most of Dusenbery ’ s research deals with how information controls behavior .
At Caltech and the early years at Georgia Tech , Dusenbery focused on experimental studies of the nematode &amp; quot ; Caenorhabditis elegans &amp; quot ; because of its small nervous system and favorable genetics . These experimental studies inspired the development of several innovative techniques : Initially , Dusenbery was attempting to understand the flow of information in the nervous system of this simple animal .
Later , he turned to the flow of information outside the organism , and how physics constrains how organisms behave .
More recently , he has also considered hydrodynamic constraints on small organisms , which can only swim at low speeds , where viscosity is far more important than inertia ( low Reynolds numbers ) . From physical analysis , Dusenbery predicted that the long-held belief that bacteria were too small to employ spatial sensing mechanisms to follow chemical gradients was erroneous and predicted that bacteria following steep gradients of chemicals at high concentrations would benefit from using a spatial mechanism .
In 2003 , a new bacterial species was discovered that swim sideways and respond to differences in oxygen concentration at the two ends of the cell , allowing them to follow steep gradients of oxygen . Similar considerations have also been applied to the behaviors of gametes , leading to an explanation of why the sperm / egg ( ovum ) and thus the male / female distinctions exist .
William Henry Davies ( entrepreneur ) William Henry Davies ( 23 June 1831 – 21 April 1921 ) was a British-Canadian businessman .
He established a business packing and shipping salt pork from Toronto , Ontario to the United Kingdom .

In 1874 , a new building was built near the mouth of the Don River .
In 1892 , he took on Joseph Wesley Flavelle as a partner in the business .
The partnership flourished to the point where the business slaughtered 500,000 pigs per year and the two became millionaires .
In 1909 , Davies retired from the business , but retained a share of the company .
In 1919 , Davies &amp; apos ; grandson Edward Carey Fox bought the company but it faltered and was merged into Canada Packers ( now Maple Leaf Foods ) in 1927 . Davies and Emma Holtby had twelve children .
After Holtby died in 1906 , Davies remarried in 1907 to Rosa Bessie Talbot .
After his retirement in 1909 , Davies tended to a farm in Markham , and later a farm in Scarborough Township .
He was a philanthropist , donating to McMaster University , Brandon College and several hospitals that treated persons with tuberculosis , an affliction his own sons had .
William Davies died in 1921 , after injuries sustained by being butted by a goat .

Bang Your Head appeared on the soundtrack of the American film “ Hiding Out ” .
&amp; quot ; Mind Your Eye &amp; quot ; was used in Colin Nutley movie “ The Ninth Company ” and the Maria Gripe film “ Agnes Cecilia ” .
In Sweden , “ Have Pleasure ” was nominated for a Grammy Award . In 1988 , Karin Wistrand sang the duet “ Stay with You ” with Orup .
The song was on the track list for six weeks .
Matts Alsberg left Lolita Pop and was replaced by Henrik Melin from the Örebro band “ Mr .
Krystal Party ” .

&amp; quot ; Hey Winner &amp; quot ; became the soundtrack to Colin Nutley &amp; apos ; s “ Heartbreak Hotel ” and the TV series “ Tusenbröder ” .
“ Hey Winner ” was also nominated for a Grammy award .
The band launched its career overseas when Benkt Svensson and Per Eriksson left the band after ten years . Lolita Pop released their last album in 1990 , which was “ Blumenkraft ” , with Fredrik Blank as new guitarist and Chris ( Muttis ) Björklund on drums .
This too was nominated for a Grammis award .
The band continued to tour until 1992 .
After that , Karin Wistrand and Fredrik Blank worked with Karin &amp; apos ; s solo album &amp; quot ; The Sun &amp; quot ; , which was released in 1993 .
Sten Booberg freelanced as a guitarist throughout the 1990s and played with , among others , the Muppets , Olle Ljungström , Marty Robbins , Orup and Idde Schultz .
Fredrik Blank played with Staffan Hellstrand , Idde Schultz and other famous musicians . Since disbandment , Lolita Pop has been frugal with reunions .

Mike Tyson vs .
Tyrell BiggsMike Tyson vs .
Tyrell Biggs , billed as &amp; quot ; The Clash for the Crown &amp; quot ; , was a professional boxing match contested on October 16 , 1987 for the Undisputed Heavyweight Championship , which consists of the WBA , WBC and IBF Heavyweight Championships . According to Mike Tyson &amp; apos ; s Book &amp; quot ; Undisputed Truth &amp; quot ; , Tyrell Biggs dissed Tyson in 1984 .
When Tyson came to wish the American Boxing Olympic team good luck , a lady came and wished the boxers a good trip .
Tyrell Biggs then proceeded to laugh and said &amp; quot ; I don &amp; apos ; t know about him , but he certainly ain &amp; apos ; t getting on that plane &amp; quot ; ( referring to Mike Tyson not being selected among the American Boxing Olympic Team ) . Only two months prior to his match with Biggs , Tyson had defeated Tony Tucker by unanimous decision to unify all three major heavyweight championships and become the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion .
Though many had hoped this would lead to a match with &amp; quot ; Lineal &amp; quot ; Heavyweight champion Michael Spinks , Spinks remained reluctant to face Tyson .
As such , Tyson instead chose to face one of his mandatory challengers , 1984 Olympic Gold Medalist Tyrell Biggs , who was undefeated since turning pro .
Prior to their fight , Biggs bashed Tyson in the press , boldly stating among other things &amp; quot ; He`s never fought anyone like me .
I don &amp; apos ; t know this Tyson the way you guys talk about him .
I know Tyson from way back when . &amp; quot ; Biggs would also promise to use his mobility and superior overall boxing ability against the stronger Tyson stating &amp; quot ; He &amp; apos ; s strong , but his strength will not hurt me .
Every fighter I fight is stronger than me , but as the fight goes on , as I use my mobility and boxing ability , strength is no longer a factor .
What will he do then ? &amp; quot ; Through the first two rounds , Biggs attempted to ward off Tyson &amp; apos ; s attack by keeping his distance and throwing sharp left jabs at Tyson while also attempting to use his distinct height advantage to avoid Tyson &amp; apos ; s power punches .
Biggs had a solid 1st round , connecting with over half of jabs while limiting Tyson to only three .
Biggs would continue to use this tactic early in round 2 , but Tyson was able to connect with a big right hook that split Biggs &amp; apos ; lip open .
By round 3 , Biggs had all but abandoned his gameplan and was overwhelmed by Tyson &amp; apos ; s power , with Tyson eventually landing a strong right hand that opened open a cut around Biggs &amp; apos ; left eye .
Tyson would continue to dominate in rounds 5 and 6 , consistently attacking Biggs with hooks and right hands , though Biggs would survive both rounds without getting knocked down .
With 30 seconds left in round 7 , Tyson hit Biggs with a left hook that sent Biggs to canvas and almost out of the ring .
Biggs was able to answer the referee &amp; apos ; s count at nine .
Tyson would continue his assault as soon as Biggs got up and quickly knocked down Biggs again , this time with a left hook , leading to referee Tony Orlando stopping the fight and awarding Tyson the victory via technical knockout . Tyson would go on to easily defeat his next two opponents , knocking out aging former Heavyweight champion Larry Holmes in the 4th round and then knocking out Tony Tubbs in the 2nd round .
This would finally set up the much anticipated Tyson – Spinks fight , a match Tyson would win in 91 seconds to capture the &amp; quot ; Lineal &amp; quot ; Heavyweight championship . Meanwhile , Biggs would struggle both in and out of the boxing ring .
He was knocked out by his next two opponents , but would rebound to win his next four fights and in 1991 , he would meet two future Undisputed Heavyweight champions , Riddick Bowe and Lennox Lewis , though he was defeated by both men by way of technical knockout . This would prove to be the last Heavyweight title fight to be scheduled for 15 rounds .

Anolis fuscoauratusAnolis fuscoauratus , commonly known as the slender anole , slender Amazon anole , or brown-eared anole , is a species of anole endemic to northern South America . Described as a new species in 1837 , in 2009 it was discovered in the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil . The specific name , &amp; quot ; fuscoauratus &amp; quot ; , comes from the Latin roots &amp; quot ; fuscus &amp; quot ; ( combining form , &amp; quot ; fusco- &amp; quot ; ) meaning &amp; quot ; dark &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; auratus &amp; quot ; meaning &amp; quot ; golden &amp; quot ; .
The name is attributed to the lizard &amp; apos ; s morphologic characteristics in that its color is dark gold .
Static hashingStatic Hashing is another form of the hashing problem which allows users to perform lookups on a finalized dictionary set ( all objects in the dictionary are final and not changing ) . Since static hashing requires that the database , its objects and reference remain the same its applications are limited .
Databases which contain information which changes rarely are also eligible as it would only require a full rehash of the entire database on rare occasion .
Examples of this include sets of words and definitions of specific languages , sets of significant data for an organization &amp; apos ; s personnel , etc . Perfect hashing is a model of hashing in which any set of n elements can be stored in a hash table of equal size and can have lookups done in constant time .
It was specifically discovered and discussed by Fredman , Komlos and Szemeredi ( 1984 ) and has therefore been nicknamed &amp; quot ; FKS Hashing &amp; quot ; . FKS Hashing makes use of a hash table with two levels in which the top level contains n buckets which each contain their own hash table .
FKS hashing requires that if collisions occur they must do so only on the top level . The top level contains a randomly created hash function , h ( x ) , which fits within the constraints of a Carter and Wegman hash function - seen in Universal hashing .
Having done so the top level shall contain n buckets labeled k , k , k , . . . , k .
Following this pattern , all of the buckets hold a hash table of size s and a respective hash function , h ( x ) .
The hash function will be decided by setting s to k and randomly going through functions until there are no collisions .
This can be done in constant time . Because there are formula _ 1 pairs of elements , of which have a probability of collision equal to 1 / n , FKS hashing can expect to have strictly less than n / 2 collisions .
Based on this fact and that each h ( x ) was selected so that the number of collisions would be at most n / 2 , the size of each table on the lower level will be no greater than 2n .

He won the Democratic nomination unopposed , and in the general election , he faced former State Representative Frank Farkas , the Republican nominee , and independent candidate Matthew Weidner .
A contentious election ensued , with Dudley attacking Farkas for his association with gambling lobbyists , and Farkas attacking Dudley over his history as a criminal defense attorney .
The &amp; quot ; Tampa Bay Times &amp; quot ; endorsed Dudley , declaring that he &amp; quot ; would bring a fresh voicer to Tallahassee and better represent consumers . &amp; quot ; In the end , Dudley narrowly emerged victorious , winning 51 % of the vote to Farkas &amp; apos ; s 44 % and Weidner &amp; apos ; s 5 % . While serving in the legislature , Dudley authored legislation that would repeal the ability of utility companies &amp; quot ; to charge customers for future power plants , &amp; quot ; which has allowed Duke Energy to charge its customers more than a billion dollars for a nuclear plant that they decided to cancel , and legislation that would allow &amp; quot ; renewable and alternative energy providers to exist alongside large utility companies . &amp; quot ; However , during the legislative session , his legislation was not considered , so he called for constitutional amendments to be placed on the ballot that would repeal the customer fee and encourage renewable energy production . Dudley was mentioned as a potential candidate to run against Republican United States Congressman David Jolly in the 13th congressional district , but he ultimately declined to run , instead choosing to seek re-election .
In his campaign for re-election , Dudley will either face Joshua Black or Bill Young II , the son of the late former Congressman Bill Young , who are running in the Republican primary .
Black drew national attention in January 2014 when he publicly called for the hanging of President Barack Obama , posting on Twitter , &amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; m past impeachment .
It &amp; apos ; s time to arrest and hang him high . &amp; quot ; Dudley condemned Black &amp; apos ; s comments , declaring , &amp; quot ; It &amp; apos ; s dangerous and unbecoming for someone who wants to lead to call for such violence and extremist action .
Wow .

John Singleton the ElderJohn Singleton ( 1715 – c .
1795 ) , born Melbourne , near Pocklington , Yorkshire was an 18th-century British jockey , who has been described as &amp; quot ; the pioneer of professional jockeys &amp; quot ; .
He is commonly referred to as John Singleton I , John Singleton , Sr .
or John Singleton the Elder to distinguish him from later relatives of the same name who were also jockeys . Singleton was born to John Singleton of Melbourne , Yorkshire and baptised on 10 May 1715 , one of nine children .
On the death of his father , he became a cattle herder , and started riding at the age of 10 , on wild young racehorses that lived among the cattle on the common land of the moors above Melbourne .
With this experience behind him , he became groom to Wilberforce Read of Grimthorpe .
He is described as having &amp; quot ; a broad chest , strong arm , quick eye , cool head and ample nerve . &amp; quot ; After a particularly good riding performance , Read rewarded Singleton with the gift of a ewe .
Singleton used this ewe for breeding , and with the sale of the offspring he was able to pay for the stallion Smiling Tom to cover his master &amp; apos ; s mare .
The mating was a successful one , resulting in a filly called Lucy , which Singleton rode to victory in a number of races in 1737 .
These included the Subscription Plates at Hambleton , Morpeth , Stockton and Sunderland .
He is said to have walked the entire 120 mile journey round the tracks of the North East , sleeping under haystacks . By 1751 , he had moved to the headquarters of British horse racing , Newmarket .
In April 1756 , he won a valuable 200 guinea match race against Mr Bowles &amp; apos ; Trajan over the Beacon Course at Newmarket on the famous Matchem .
In Newmarket , he became trainer and jockey to fellow Yorkshireman and future Prime Minister , the Marquis of Rockingham .
He was used by Rockingham in all major races from the early 1760s until 1780 , riding at Newmarket in the spring and Thixendale in Yorkshire in the summer . His greatest successes came on the Bay Malton , named after the Yorkshire town where Rockingham had estates .
In October 1765 , without Singleton on board , the Bay Malton had raced Gimcrack , the most famous racehorse of the day .
The Bay Malton beat Gimcrack &amp; apos ; very easy &amp; apos ; , winning Rockingham 9,000 guineas .
At York in August 1766 , the Bay Malton set a new record of 7 minutes 43 1 / 2 seconds for four miles in the Great Subscription Purse .
It was also on the Bay Malton that he rode his most memorable victory at Newmarket &amp; apos ; s second spring meeting in April 1767 .
He beat the acclaimed horses Herod , Turf and Ascham at a race that brought more people to the racecourse than had ever been seen before .
Afterwards , Singleton was presented with a specially commissioned gold cup with figures of horse and jockey . In 1769 , Singleton married the widow of horseman Peter Jackson , and had a son , also called John .
This John didn &amp; apos ; t follow his father into the riding profession and instead became a scholar at St .
John &amp; apos ; s , Cambridge .
After graduating he took up a post as a land agent near the family home in East Yorkshire . The elder Singleton had a nephew , another John Singleton , who did become a jockey .
John the nephew also came into the employ of Rockingham and won the first St .
Leger in 1776 .
John Singleton the nephew , confusingly also had a son called John , who rode the winner of the 1797 Derby , although other scholars have cast doubt as to whether these latter John Singletons were relations at all . In 1772 , the elder Singleton was still riding at a weight of 8 st 7 lbs ( 54 . 0 kg ) , and it was said that &amp; quot ; his head and nerves remained as cool as his chest and arms were strong and solid . &amp; quot ; He eventually retired from Rockingham &amp; apos ; s employ in 1780 and died , depending on which source is to be believed , in 1793 , 1795 or 1799 .
He is buried in the churchyard at Great Givendale , near Grimthorpe , where his winnings had helped make the family &amp; apos ; s fortune . Singleton was twice immortalised by famous equine portraitist , George Stubbs , in commissions by Lord Rockingham .
In the first painting of c .
1765-67 he was portrayed riding Bay Malton .
In the second he is on board Rockingham &amp; apos ; s bay Scrub , standing by a lake possibly at Wentworth .
Mickey &amp; apos ; s Steam RollerMickey &amp; apos ; s Steam Roller is a 1934 animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists .
In the cartoon , Mickey Mouse is the driver of a steamroller which is hijacked by his two nephews .
It was directed by David Hand and features the voices of Walt Disney as Mickey and Marcellite Garner as Minnie Mouse and Mickey &amp; apos ; s nephews . Although this is the third animated appearance of Mickey &amp; apos ; s nephews , it is the first to show only two of them .
The film is therefore considered the first identifiable and most significant animated appearance of Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse , Mickey &amp; apos ; s twin nephews from the &amp; quot ; Mickey Mouse &amp; quot ; comic strip . The film was also called The Steamroller during production , and Mickey &amp; apos ; s Steamroller upon its re-release .
Disney archivist Dave Smith has also stylized the title as Mickey &amp; apos ; s Steam-Roller . Mickey Mouse drives an anthropomorphic steamroller while a group of dogface workmen perform road maintenance .
Meanwhile , Minnie Mouse appears as the nanny of a young Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse , pushing them in a stroller and singing &amp; quot ; Pease Porridge Hot &amp; quot ; .
Mickey drives by and they wave at him .
Mickey stops and gives the boys a ride with the steamroller by attaching the vehicle &amp; apos ; s tow rope to their stroller . After this , Mickey flirts with Minnie by giving her some Sweethearts candy and tries to steal a kiss .
While they are distracted , Morty and Ferdie climb onto Mickey &amp; apos ; s steamroller and drive it away .
Mickey frantically runs after the nephews , but when he attempts to cut them off , he finds himself being chased instead . The nephews go on to cause extensive damage with the steamroller .
Finally they chase Mickey into a multistory hotel , destroying the entire building except for the bathtub on each floor , each with a current bather .
Unhurt in the rubble , Mickey laughs as Morty and Ferdie see-saw on a board balanced on his head .
Chevrolet Silverado 250The Chevrolet Silverado 250 is a NASCAR-sanctioned Truck race , held at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park ( Mosport ) as part of the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series tour , first held in 2013 . The first race held on a road course by the Camping World Truck Series in 13 years , it was announced that the race would be held starting in 2013 , on Labor Day weekend , in November 2012 , replacing the previous NASCAR Nationwide Series race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as NASCAR &amp; apos ; s annual event held in Canada .
In April 2013 , it was announced that the race would be sponsored by General Motors Canada , becoming the Chevrolet Silverado 250 . The inaugural event , run September 1 , 2013 , saw James Buescher win the pole at a speed of ; Ty Dillon led the most laps in the race before contact between him and Chase Elliott at White &amp; apos ; s Corner coming to the checkered flag sent Dillon into a tire barrier .
Dillon promised that &amp; quot ; next week he won &amp; apos ; t finish the race &amp; quot ; but he didn &amp; apos ; t pursue any payback eventually .
In 2014 Ryan Blaney battled Germán Quiroga with Blaney beating Quiroga in a photo-finish .
In 2016 , John Hunter Nemechek and Cole Custer were battling for the lead when Nemechek bumped Custer before running both Custer and himself off-road , pinning Custer to the wall .
Before the winner was declared , Nemechek was tackled by Custer ; Nemechek would be named the winner .

Spider ( 2007 film ) Spider is a 2007 Australian black comedy short film directed by Nash Edgerton and written by David Michôd and Nash Edgerton .
The film had its world premiere in competition at the Sydney Film Festival on 17 June 2007 .
After that the film compete at number of film festivals and later theatrically released with Edgerton &amp; apos ; s feature-film &amp; quot ; The Square &amp; quot ; . A couple , Jack and Jill , are driving in a car .
Jill is angry at Jack , so he enters a gas station and buys a card , flowers , chocolate , and a toy spider .
As Jill re-fills the gas tank , Jack hides the spider in the sun visor above her seat .
Jill ignores the flowers and card but is won over by the chocolate .
She pulls down the sun visor , causing the spider to fall out and the car to nearly crash .
After the car stops , Jack laughs and tosses the spider towards Jill , who jolts backwards into the road and is struck by a passing vehicle .
Paramedics arrive , and as one is about to insert a syringe into the unconscious Jill &amp; apos ; s arm , he is startled by the spider toy and accidentally throws the syringe into Jack &amp; apos ; s eye . The film earned mainly positive reviews from critics .
Jason Sondhi of &amp; quot ; short of the week &amp; quot ; gave film the positive review said &amp; quot ; It ’ s for sure a superior film , I just think I loved everything about it except the parts that I assume everyone loves . &amp; quot ; David Brook of &amp; quot ; blue print review &amp; quot ; gave the film four out of five stars and said &amp; quot ; A simple one-gag comedy-short that works surprisingly well due to some accomplished naturalistic direction and performances .
A nice touch at the end , although unnecessary , went down well with the audience too . &amp; quot ; Wesley Morris of Boston . com said that &amp; quot ; as well-delivered as its shocks are , this film is cleverness in the service of cruelty . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Spider &amp; quot ; was released on DVD with The Square , on 24 August 2010 . Edgerton directed a follow up of &amp; quot ; Spider &amp; quot ; , a short film entitled &amp; quot ; Bear &amp; quot ; which was released in 2011 .
Linn MeyersLinn Meyers ( born March 17 , 1968 ) is an American , Washington , D . C . – based artist .
Her work has been exhibited in the United States and abroad .
She is known for her hand-drawn lines and tracings for site-specific installations . Meyers was born in Washington , D . C . , where she lived until she was 17 , at which time she moved to Paris , France .
In 1986 she moved back to the U . S .
to attend The Cooper Union in New York City , where she graduated in 1990 with a BFA .
In 1991 Meyers moved to Oakland , California , to pursue an MFA at The California College of the Arts in Oakland California ( now located in San Francisco . ) After completing her master &amp; apos ; s degree ( 1993 ) , Meyers returned to New York City .
In 1997 she spent several months living and working in New Haven , Connecticut , before relocating to Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , where she lived for 4 years .
Meyers returned to her native Washington , D . C in 2002 . Meyers uses repetitive applications of line and color to draw on a variety of surfaces including paper , vellum , mylar , and gallery walls .
&amp; quot ; Her drawings tend to grow from themselves , each successive line determining the next . &amp; quot ; Each piece begins with a single mark – a line that traces a pre-determined framework of circles , or a simple singular gesture .
This first stroke defines the direction in which the entire image will evolve – each line a direct response to the mark made just before .
These marks amass to create an image , which is both still and moving , ordered and chaotic , both pointing toward perfection and also wholly imperfect . Meyers &amp; apos ; works &amp; quot ; function like a map of sorts , charting time and space . &amp; quot ; At the core of the work is the artist &amp; apos ; s own relationship to time : learning how to move back and forth between natural time , measured time , and subjective time .
Meyers has said , “ my works are records of a defined period of time , and in that particular way they are not abstract .
They are a form of realism and narrative . ” “ Indeed Meyers ’ work does not erase the artist ’ s hand ; by contrast it is the most direct result of her body movements in a given time period and thereby is a trace of that very personal experience . ” Meyers has been making large , site-specific wall drawings in museums and galleries since 2000 . These projects require a great deal of endurance and involve drawing in the space over the course of days , sometimes weeks , accumulating lines into dense and intricate compositions .
This scale allows Meyers to respond to architectural spaces and magnifies the wholly committed performativity of her process .
On Meyers &amp; apos ; exhibition for The Hammer Museum , Senior Curator Anne Ellegood wrote , “ the sense of being present while viewing the work is also amplified at this larger scale , allowing viewers to experience the work not just visually but also physically .
To see a wall drawing is to be surrounded by it and to feel oneself to be part of the work . ” Many of Meyers ’ wall drawings are created with an awareness of their ultimate impermanence .
Meyers has exhibited in venues that include the Hammer Museum , Los Angeles ; the Phillips Collection , Washington , D . C . ; the Smithsonian American Art Museum , Washington D . C . ; the Frick Museum , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ; the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Art , Japan ; the Mattress Factory , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ; The Corcoran Gallery of Art , Washington , D . C . ; the National Museum of Women in the Arts , Washington , D . C . , The Weatherspoon Museum , Greensboro , North Carolina ; Paris Concret , Paris , France ; and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden , Washington , D . C . Meyers has received numerous awards , including a Pollock Krasner Award , a Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship , and four DC Commission on the Arts Fellowships .
She has been Artist in Residence at The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden , the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art , The Millay Colony , The Tamarind Institute , The Bemis Institute , and the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts .

Okubo algebraIn algebra , an Okubo algebra or pseudo-octonion algebra is an 8-dimensional non-associative algebra similar to the one studied by .
Okubo algebras are composition algebras , flexible algebras ( &amp; quot ; A &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; BA &amp; quot ; ) = ( &amp; quot ; AB &amp; quot ; ) &amp; quot ; A &amp; quot ; ) , Lie admissible algebras , and power associative , but are not associative , not alternative algebras , and do not have an identity element . Okubo &amp; apos ; s example was the algebra of 3 by 3 trace zero complex matrices , with the product of &amp; quot ; X &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Y &amp; quot ; given by &amp; quot ; aXY &amp; quot ; + &amp; quot ; bYX &amp; quot ; – Tr ( &amp; quot ; XY &amp; quot ; ) &amp; quot ; I &amp; quot ; / 3 where &amp; quot ; I &amp; quot ; is the identity matrix and &amp; quot ; a &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; b &amp; quot ; satisfy &amp; quot ; a &amp; quot ; + &amp; quot ; b &amp; quot ; = 3 &amp; quot ; ab &amp; quot ; = 1 .
The Hermitian elements form an 8-dimensional real non-associative division algebra .
A similar construction works for any cubic alternative separable algebra over a field containing a primitive cube root of unity .
An Okubo algebra is an algebra constructed in this way from the trace 0 elements of a degree 3 central simple algebra over a field . Unital composition algebras are called Hurwitz algebras .
If the ground field is the field of real numbers and is positive-definite , then is called a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra . If has characteristic not equal to 2 , then a bilinear form is associated with the quadratic form . Assuming has a multiplicative unity , define involution and right and left multiplication operators byEvidently is an involution and preserves the quadratic form .
The overline notation stresses the fact that complex and quaternion conjugation are partial cases of it .
These operators have the following properties : These properties are proved starting from polarized version of the identity : Setting or yields and .
Hence .
Similarly .
Hence .
By the polarized identity so .
Applied to 1 this gives .
Replacing by gives the other identity .
Substituting the formula for in gives . Another operation may be defined in a Hurwitz algebra asThe algebra is a composition algebra not generally unital , known as a para-Hurwitz algebra .
In dimensions 4 and 8 these are para-quaternion and para-octonion algebras . A para-Hurwitz algebra satisfiesConversely , an algebra with a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form satisfying this equation is either a para-Hurwitz algebra or an eight-dimensional pseudo-octonion algebra .
Similarly , a flexible algebra satisfyingis either a Hurwitz algebra , a para-Hurwitz algebra or an eight-dimensional pseudo-octonion algebra .

Leon RauschBorn Edgar Leon Rausch on October 2 , 1927 in Billings , Missouri , Leon Rausch is known as &amp; quot ; the voice &amp; quot ; of &amp; quot ; Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys &amp; quot ; .
Rausch was lead vocalist from 1958 until the early 60s when he created his own band &amp; quot ; The New Texas Playboys &amp; quot ; .
In 1973 , Wills asked Rausch to rejoin the Texas Playboys to record his final album &amp; quot ; For the Last Time &amp; quot ; .
After Wills died in 1975 , Rausch and the original Texas Playboys continued to record and tour until the band played the final concert in 1986 .
Rausch still performs each year at the Bob Wills day festival the last weekend of April in Turkey , Texas at the Bob Wills community center .
The music of The Texas Playboys is &amp; quot ; Western Swing &amp; quot ; .
In 2011 , the Texas Legislature adopted a resolution designating western swing as the official &amp; quot ; State Music of Texas &amp; quot ; .
Rausch made a memorable appearance as a band singer in the 1998 Stephen Frears film The Hi-Lo Country , in a scene featuring one of the film &amp; apos ; s highlights — Don Walser &amp; apos ; s rendition of &amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; ll Hold You in My Heart . &amp; quot ;
Bart SchneemannBart Schneemann ( born 1954 , in Melbourne ) is a Dutch oboist , conductor , teacher and artistic director for the Netherlands Wind Ensemble .
In 1977 he graduated from the Conservatory in Amsterdam .
From 1976 to 1996 , he was the first chair oboist in the Radio Filharmonisch Orkest and the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra .
He retired from playing in the orchestra to put all his time towards his solo career and his activities in the Netherlands Wind Ensemble .
Schneemann plays a wide repertoire in various formations , ranging from older music ( on modern oboe and classical / baroque oboe ) to contemporary music .
Many composers have written music especially for him , including Tristan Keuris , Wolfgang Rihm , John Zorn , Gia Kantsjeli , Kevin Volans , George Crumb , György Kurtág and Jacob ter Veldhuis .
He performed solos in various orchestras conducted by , among others : Valeri Gergiev , Edo de Waart , Ernest Bour , Lev Markiz , Frans Brüggen , Roy Goodman and Ton Koopman .
Schneeman also conducted the National Youth Orchestra , the Amsterdam Sinfonietta , the Brabant Orchestra and the North Netherlands Symphony Orchestra .
As a soloist , conductor and in his capacity in the Netherlands Wind Ensemble , he is often asked for stage performances in all kinds of festivals and events worldwide . Schneemann is a professor at Royal Conservatory of The Hague . In 1988 , Schneemann was asked to breathe new life into the Netherlands Wind Ensemble ( NBE ) , founded in 1961 .
His arrival transformed the ensemble into an enthusiastic group of young musicians with an open-minded ear for various music genres .
With Johan Dorrestein , he established the NBE as a flexible company in the Dutch music world , a point of reference being the New Year ’ s concerts in the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam , which are aired live on TV .
As the NBE concert programmer , Schneemann has developed his own special signature .
Apart from the high quality in the ensemble ’ s playing and infectious amusement , he aims for a dramatic line bringing music genres ( and people ) from different backgrounds together in every programme .
With various educational programmes , the NBE provides guidance for young wind players and composers on their way to concert stages and conservatory . The NBE has a special connection with the Dutch Royal Family .
The ensemble accompanied Queen Beatrix on three state visits ( to Thailand , India and Turkey ) .
On 30 April 2013 , the NBE will be playing at Prince Willem-Alexander ’ s coronation .
Schneemann will also be putting together the music programme for the celebrations for Queen Beatrix in Ahoy in Rotterdam on 14 September 2013 .
SoxC groupSoxC group is group C of Sry-related HMG box proteins transcription factors .
SoxC genes play an important role in determining the cell fate of neuronal mesenchymal progenitor cells in many developmental processes . In &amp; quot ; Drosophila melanogaster &amp; quot ; ( fly ) , &amp; quot ; Caenorhabditis elegans &amp; quot ; ( worm ) , and other lower animals SoxC is made up of only one member , but humans , mice and most other vertebrates have three members of the SoxC group .
The three are Sox4 , Sox11 , and Sox12 .
These three are extremely similar to one another , more so than other proteins , but they are all highly distinct in the way that they bind DNA and active transcription &amp; quot ; in vitro &amp; quot ; with different affinity .
The three found in humans and other vertebrates are single-exon genes .
The SoxC proteins have 2 domains , the first an Sry-related HMG box DNA binding domain that is located near the N-terminal and the second a trans-activation domain , known as TAD , located near the C-terminal .
Although these are transcription factors , to this date there is no evidence of post-translational modifications on SoxC members , but they can work cooperatively with other proteins though , such as transcription factors Brn2 and Brn1 . All of the SoxC proteins share 67 % identity and 94 % similarity in the 33 residues of the C-terminal domain .
All SoxC genes show 84 % identity and 95 % similarity to one another in the HMG box , which is just slightly more highly conserved than the C-terminal domain .
The SoxC proteins only have between 45 % to 67 % identity to Sry and the other Sox proteins .
The SoxC genes found in the &amp; quot ; Drosophila melanogaster &amp; quot ; ( fly ) , &amp; quot ; Caenorhabditis elegans &amp; quot ; ( worm ) , and other lower animals are closely linked to those found in humans and other vertebrates .
The SoxC genes are highly conserved through vertebrate evolution and are similar enough to those in invertebrates and other lower animal species to speculate that these are based off an evolutionary necessity from before vertebrates and invertebrates separated through evolution . If these SoxC proteins were missing during developmental stages it would cause widespread problems through the body of mice , and in many cases death .
These have not been studied in humans though , because no occurrences have been linked to congential malformations of any of these proteins .
In mice however , mice embryos without Sox4 die of heart defects , but mice newborns without Sox11 do live but have widespread defects .
Mice without Sox12 are viable and show no outward signs of malformation .
Some of the common human malformations are also seen in mice with mutated SoxC , such as cleft palate or heart outflow tract malformation .
There is no evidence of the correlation between SoxC mutations in humans and these malformations , but there is speculation . Sox4 facilitates differentiation of lymphocytes , osteoblasts , pancreatic beta cells and along with Sox11 promotes neural differentiation .
In recent years , the belief has raised that SoxC genes may lead to tumor prognosis at elevated levels .
Increased expression of Sox11 and Sox4 are seen in numerous tumors and cancers and it is possible that the tumors differ depending on the circumstance and primary transformation mechanism .

National Airlines Flight 102National Airlines Flight 102 was a cargo flight operated by National Airlines between the British military base Camp Bastion in Afghanistan and Al Maktoum Airport in Dubai , with a refueling stop at Bagram Airfield , Afghanistan .
On 29 April 2013 , the Boeing 747-400 operating the flight crashed moments after taking off from Bagram , killing all seven people on board . The aircraft involved was a Boeing 747-428BCF , registration S / N 25630 .
It was manufactured in 1993 as a passenger aircraft and later modified for service as a freighter before being sold to National Airlines .
At the time of the crash , the aircraft was flying on behalf of the United States Air Force &amp; apos ; s Air Mobility Command . At the time of the crash the airline had been operating between Camp Bastion and Dubai for a month .
The accident flight had originated in Camp Bastion and had stopped at Bagram Airfield to refuel .
The aircraft then took off from Bagram &amp; apos ; s runway 03 at 15 : 30 local time and was climbing through when its nose rose sharply .
The aircraft then stalled , crashed , and exploded into a large fireball .
The crash site was off the end of runway 03 , within the perimeter of the airfield .
All seven crew , all of whom were U . S .
citizens , died : four pilots , two mechanics , and a loadmaster . A thunderstorm was also in the vicinity of Bagram at the time of the crash and the wind changed direction by 120 ° during a one-hour period commencing approximately 35 minutes before the crash .
A dashboard camera on a car in the vicinity of the runway end recorded the crash .
CNN stated that a government official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the video was authentic . The United States National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) and the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority investigated the crash .
The NTSB reported in a 30 April 2013 press release that representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Boeing Company would also provide technical expertise and aid in the investigation . On 2 June 2013 , investigators from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation of Afghanistan confirmed the load shift hypothesis as the starting point : three armoured vehicles and two mine-sweeping vehicles , totalling 80 tons of weight , had not been properly secured .
At least one armoured vehicle had come loose and rolled backwards against the airplane &amp; apos ; s rear bulkhead , damaging the bulkhead .
This also crippled key hydraulic systems and damaged the horizontal stabilizer components - most notably the jackscrew , which rendered the airplane uncontrollable .
Control of the aircraft was therefore lost , with the abnormal pitch-up rotation , stall , and crash to the ground ensuing .
The damage made it impossible for the crew to regain control of the aircraft . The NTSB determined that the probable cause of this accident was &amp; quot ; National Airlines ’ inadequate procedures for restraining special cargo loads , which resulted in the loadmaster ’ s improper restraint of the cargo . &amp; quot ; One of the key recommendations was to mandate training for all loadmasters .
This has now been standardized across the cargo airlines under the Federal Aviation Administration . The crash interrupted the New Zealand Defence Force &amp; apos ; s ( NZDF ) withdrawal from Afghanistan , as it was only hours away from using another National Airlines aircraft to fly equipment out of the country ; after the crash the NZDF indefinitely postponed using National Airlines for its airlift requirements . The Canadian TV series &amp; quot ; Mayday &amp; quot ; ( also known as &amp; quot ; Air Crash Disaster &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Air Emergency &amp; quot ; in the US and &amp; quot ; Air Crash Investigation &amp; quot ; in the UK and the rest of the world ) covered Flight 102 in episode 10 of series 16 , called &amp; quot ; Afghan Nightmare &amp; quot ; , first broadcast in 2017 .

Save the Pearls : Revealing EdenSave the Pearls : Revealing Eden is a 2012 young adult novel by American author Victoria Foyt and the first book in the Save the Pearls series .
The book is set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian society and follows the titular character of Eden as she attempts to move outside of her set station in life and find a way to survive outside the norms set by society . Book two of the series , &amp; quot ; Adapting Eden &amp; quot ; , was released in the spring of 2013 . The book follows Eden , a young white female who has been raised in an apocalyptic environment .
A solar burst has decimated nearly all life on earth , forcing everyone to live underground to avoid &amp; quot ; the Heat &amp; quot ; , the world &amp; apos ; s name for skin cancer .
The underground society relies on a racial system where the darker your skin naturally is , the more likely your rate of survival is .
Each race is given a name for their station , with whites being named Pearls and blacks being named Coals .
Eden spends most of her days in a research assistant position which she achieved due to her father &amp; apos ; s importance to a secret assignment , and most of her nights hoping that her boyfriend Jamal will one day choose her as his mate .
She is often at odds with Bramford , a rich Coal who has hired her father , and occasionally resents the fact that she must wear dark make-up over her body to hide her skin color . When the scientific experiment run by her father and Bramford is attacked by a political group which believe Pearls to be inferior , Eden barely manages to escape with her father and Bramford .
Once outside , Eden discovers that the experiment &amp; apos ; s purpose was to infuse humanity with the DNA of several animals to ensure a higher rate of survival , and that Bramford was the test subject .
Bramford brings Eden and her father to a village hidden in a rainforest which had managed to survive the solar blast , and where he and Eden &amp; apos ; s father plan to progress further with the experiment .
As time passes Eden , slowly falls in love with Bramford and discovers his previous relationship with a Pearl and that he had an albino son with her , something which is seen as unbearable in that society .
The preparations for the next experiment are eventually finished , only for the village to come under attack by the same political group .
The group is defeated and Eden makes the choice to undergo the infusion of animal DNA with Bramford &amp; apos ; s son . &amp; quot ; Revealing Eden &amp; quot ; was published on January 10 , 2012 by Sand Dollar Press Inc , a publishing company founded by Foyt . In August 2012 &amp; quot ; Weird Tales &amp; quot ; magazine announced would publish an excerpt from the novel &amp; apos ; s first chapter .
The magazine cancelled plans to publish the excerpt after readers and authors threatened to boycott the magazine .
John Harlacher removed a post by editor Marvin Kaye that defended the book and posted a message apologizing to readers , a move that was criticized by ThinkProgress &amp; apos ; s Alyssa Rosenberg . Imogen Russell Williams in the &amp; quot ; Guardian &amp; quot ; panned the book , saying &amp; quot ; there is barely a detectable sign of any plot ; the whole thing is remarkable for repetition , &amp; # 91 ; and &amp; # 93 ; incoherence &amp; quot ; , and also criticised the book &amp; apos ; s handling of race . In the book racial groups receive titles according to their ethnicity , with black characters receiving the name &amp; quot ; Coal &amp; quot ; , which some readers viewed as a racial slur .
Foyt also received criticism for the promotional videos used in the book &amp; apos ; s marketing campaign , which depicted the main character of Eden in cosmetic makeup used by whites in the series to protect themselves from &amp; quot ; The Heat &amp; quot ; .
Some viewers felt that the makeup resembled blackface . Foyt responded to the criticism by stating that she had not intended the book &amp; apos ; s contents or advertising to be racist , and that her intention was to write a novel addressing the issue of global warming .

Small arms master gunnerSmall arms master gunner ( SAMG ) is an appointment of a subject matter expert in the field of small arms , optics , and lasers for combat units .
Not all units have SAMGs .
Units which understand that the knowledge of operating a weapon in conjunction with the myriad assortment of optics and lasers to their fullest extent employ SAMGs to help keep their operators current on these devices .
Having a &amp; quot ; go-to-guy &amp; quot ; at the division , brigade , and battalion levels , who can supply the correct off-sets for bore-lighting the lasers , and who not only understands , but can teach how , to zero the optics correctly is an invaluable commodity in the combat arms arena . In the United States infantry , small arms master gunners are experts in all aspects of the units weapon systems .
The &amp; quot ; weapon systems &amp; quot ; range from the standard infantry rifle with optics and lasers , assigned machine guns and grenade launchers , with optics and lasers , as well as any specialized ( sniper ) weapons that may be fielded .
The small arms master gunners fill advisory rather than command posts .
They are trained to assist in the planning , development , execution , and evaluation of all weapon systems , to include crew served weapons related training ( individual , crew , and collective ) , unit planning for ranges , and are able to resource needed materials for each piece of equipment . In 2000 at Fort Benning , Georgia , the infantry schoolhouse saw the need to create a SAMG course that would get NCOs &amp; quot ; smart &amp; quot ; on the optics ( namely the M-68 ) and lasers ( namely the PEQ-4 ) being fielded during this time .
A curriculum was created by the 2-29th , and NCOs from the 18th Airborne Corps ( 82nd ABN DIV , 101st ABN ( ASSLT ) , and the 10th MTN DIV ) attended .
The schoolhouse lasted only a year and a half , but not due to lack of progress .
As soon as a mechanized infantry sergeant major took over , the school , along with its resources , were abolished . Fort Bragg seized the initiative and began its own course in 2001 .
This school taught small arms , as well as the Javelin .
During this time , the army was being fielded optics and lasers in rapid succession , due to the events of 9 / 11 .
The course ran until optempo to Afghanistan and Iraq depleted the units on post , because every brigade was deployed ; however by this time every battalion , brigade , and the division had their own dedicated small arms master gunners .
Training remained at these levels until 2010 . In 2010 , the Fort Bliss command sergeant major realized that the knowledge on weapons , optics , lasers , and now thermals , was virtually nonexistent .
He noticed different companies within battalions were zeroing all their equipment differently .
Soldiers did not know how to use their lasers or thermals , and there was no consistency on the installation .
He appointed a 1st Armored Division small arms master gunner ( a graduate of the Fort Bragg SAMG course ) to create a curriculum that would put all his NCOs on the same page with the various equipment issued throughout his division .
The Fort Bliss SAMG built a course that encompassed every weapon , laser , and optic used on Fort Bliss .
There had to be many changes made to the course that the SAMG was building , versus the one he attended in 2001 .
This course also included an introduction to the many available training tools and resources that most Fort Bliss NCOs were unaware of .
The SAMG partnered with industry and incorporated NAMMO talley defense , as well as insight technology ( L-3 ) into the course , in order to effectively train NCOs on the equipment the correct way .
Great strides were reached on Fort Bliss , and by 2012 the Fort Bliss Division SAMG was teaching a course once a quarter , running competitions on the installation , and was a &amp; quot ; one-stop-shop &amp; quot ; for anything small arms related .
During this time , the Fort Bliss SAMG program had trained over 200 non-commissioned officers ( as well as one captain ) .
It had also shared its curriculum with the 25th ID , and the unit which originally spawned the SAMG course , 2-29 at Fort Benning GA .
The Fort Bliss PCSM , who had originally appointed the Fort Bliss SAMG , left Fort Bliss in summer 2012 .
Fort Bliss &amp; apos ; Command team ( now a mechanized group ) did not share the same enthusiasm for the lethality of the soldier on the ground and the Fort Bliss Small Arms Master Gunner Course disintegrated in February 2013 , as the original Fort Bliss SAMG retired . The small arms master gunner &amp; apos ; s specific duties ; SME on all weapons in the unit which the SAMG operates .
SME on all optics in the unit which the SAMG operates .
SME on all lasers in the unit which the SAMG operates .
SME on all thermal devices in the unit which the SAMG operates .

Team members knowledge and skills include safety procedures , equipment capabilities , knots , rappelling , belaying , ascending , anchors and anchor systems , rigging for raising and lowering systems , litter handling , patient packaging , single victim rescue , self-rescue , and problem solving .
The environments that the team can find itself include vertical , high angle , and low angle cliff-side rope rescue , swiftwater and flood rescue , and urban heavy rescue . Members of Search and Rescue with 4x4 vehicles form the 4WD Team .
They provide transportation and support to the remote areas of the county and assist medical teams on the Pismo State Dunes .
Vehicle teams are used for “ hasty ” searches of trails , streets , roads and as attraction devices to bring missing people to the searchers .
Most areas of the county are a short distance from some form of road or trail and the vehicle team transports the search teams to their assignments .
Training includes practice in rock crawling , mud and water driving and driving in the sand dunes . The Communications Team provides the equipment and skills to assist the Search and Rescue team with their duties while in the field .

Spello &amp; apos ; s InfiorateSpello ’ s Infiorate is a manifestation which takes place every year in the small Umbrian town of Spello ( Italy ) on the occasion of the Corpus Domini feast , on the ninth Sunday after Easter .
On that night , almost a thousand people work incessantly to create carpets and pictures made of flowers along the narrow town ’ s streets .
The floral creations cover streets throughout the historical centre in preparation to the passage of the Blessed Sacrament carried in procession by the bishop on Sunday morning .
The result is a unique one mile-long path of beautiful floral creations with an explosion of colours and scents .
The custom of honouring divinity by throwing flowers or creating flower compositions is a dateless event in many areas of the world .
In Spello this tradition , which has gone from first throwing flowers , then to placing them in art forms on the pavement , is documented in the Municipal archives for the first time in 1831 .
On the occasion of the visit of bishop Ignazio Cadolini on October 19 , 1831 , the gonfaloniere Francesco Nicoletti asked all citizens with houses facing the main street to “ keep clean and free from all rubbish their respective areas around each house and spread flowers and greenery &amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; ” in occasion of the procession .
The iconographic testimonials about the Infiorate in Spello date back to the beginning of the 19th century : Benvenuto Crispoldi ( 1886 – 1923 ) , painter and mayor of Spello , depicted the procession of Corpus Domini on the flower carpets in one of his paintings . In the city archives we can find many pictures belonging to the Fascist period , in which references to the political environment are very evident .
We can see Infiorate containing Casa del Fascio in the background ( a landmark of fascist architecture ) and even Swastika decoration motifs .
Such influences are clear examples of how religious devotion , which has always been the foundation of Infiorate , was influenced and interpreted depending upon the historical and social context . As techniques evolved over time , what was once a long uninterrupted carpet of flowers , characterized by a relatively simple design , morphed into separate , more sophisticated sets of bigger compositions .
Distinct groups of creators emerged , focusing on improving artistic execution and addressing more complex religious and social messages .
Starting from the mid-60s , Infiorate ’ s design , until then characterized by geometrical schemes and central figures with symbols almost exclusively connected to the Corpus Domini , evolved constantly , reaching by the end of the 80s a style dominated by the presence of a central composition . The flower carpets , in its own a form of true painting with flower petals , have reached over time high levels of technical sophistication which , coupled with the expression and interpretation of increasingly complex and often abstract socio-religious themes , forced the Infiorate ’ s artists to dedicate more time to the concept and design stage as well as to the in depth study of philosophical and historical themes . In the 60s the creation of a contest to recognize the best infiorata has stimulated the competition among the groups of artists and has led to an accelerated development and improvement in the quality of the compositions .
The first informal competitions were organized by the prelates of the two main Spello ’ s parishes : S .
Maria Maggiore and S .
Lorenzo Martire .
Since 1962 , when the first official contest was established thanks to the funding and sponsorship of Pro Loco ( local agency for the promotion of tourism presided at the time by Prof .
Giacomo Prampolini ) , the anticipation for the proclamation of the best infiorata has become an important and essential corollary to the festivity of Corpus Domini in Spello . The prize consists in the right to hold for a year onto a bronze statue of Sesto Properzio ( c .
47 – 14 B . C . ) , the Latin poet whose birthplace is contended between Spello and Assisi . In recent years , the fame of Spello ’ s Infiorate has reached out of the regional and national borders .
Their creators are called to compose flower carpets for special occasions or to honour institutional political and religious figures such as Popes ( John Paul II ) and Italian Republic Presidents ( Sandro Pertini and Oscar Luigi Scalfaro ) .
They have also had the honour of taking their art to iconoclastic religious places , such as Lourdes and Bethlehem . Since 2002 infiorate ’ s artists have been organized independently as the association “ Le Infiorate di Spello ” ( http : / / www . infioratespello . it ) with the purpose of promoting the manifestation , maintaining and enhancing the quality of the compositions and preserving the continuity of this important tradition .
Over the course of the last 10 years the association has seen its base expanding to almost 1000 members , in representation of more than 40 groups of artists . Differently from other similar manifestations , Spello ’ s Infiorate creators compose their splendid carpets using flowers collected in the wild .
While the use of other parts of the plants , like leaves and berries is allowed , the preference is given to the use of petals only , either fresh or dried .
The use of wood and any kind of synthetic material is severely prohibited . Exsiccation of the flowers must be carried out naturally in the sun .
Dried petals are sometime gently chopped to improve their deployment in high resolution details and fine design elements .
However , they cannot be turned into a powder as the floral nature and appearance of the material have to be always preserved .
The gathering , meticulous collection and processing of these natural materials starts several months before their actual use , becoming often a year around effort in order to tap into the variety of seasonal floral species . Drawings are either traced on the streets using chalk and the technique of division into squares , or drawn onto paper and then stuck to the ground , thus allowing bigger and more complex designs .
The representations , always inspired by religious themes , often contain intricate three-dimensional effects , usually obtained with the use of prospective , shading and layering of the flowers , without the use of any glue .
Each infiorata must have either a minimum length of 12 metres , or cover a surface of at least 24 square metres , depending on the nature of the composition : Quadro ( single scene picture ) vs Tappeto ( floral carpet with repetitive geometrical patterns ) .

Pieter VanderlynPieter Vanderlyn ( c .
1687 – 1778 ) was an American colonial painter . Pieter Vanderlyn was born in Holland , in about 1687 , studied in Amsterdam , and served with the Dutch navy off the coast of Africa probably as a surgeon .
From here he went to Curaçao before moving on to arrive in New York in 1718 .
In this year he married Gerretje Van de Berg , who bore him a daughter the following year , but both died shortly afterwards .
Four years later , he married Geertruy Vas , daughter of Petrus Vas , a Dutch clergyman with a congregation in Kingston , New York .
He made his living as a portrait painter , land speculator and in other trades , travelling frequently between Kingston and Albany and residing at various times in each city . His paintings were completed between 1730 and 1745 and were all unsigned , though some bore an inscription .
Analysis of these inscriptions , together with other sources , enabled Mary Black in 1969 to identify Vanderlyn as the &amp; quot ; Gansevoort Limner , &amp; quot ; an otherwise unidentified portrait painter of this era , though the attribution remains contreversial .
There are works by Vanderlyn in the collections of the National Gallery of Art , the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Newark Museum of Art , the New-York Historical Society , the Terra Foundation for American Art and the Chrysler Museum of Art . Vanderlyn was living in Kingston during the American Revolutionary War until British forces burned the city on October 13 , 1777 .
This event forced him to flee to his son &amp; apos ; s home in Shawangunk , where he died the following year .
The painter John Vanderlyn and lawyer Henry Van Der Lyn were his grandsons .

Human viromeHuman virome is the collection of viruses in and on the human body .
Defining the virome is thought to provide an understanding of microbes and how they affect human health and disease .
Viruses in the human body infect both human cells as well as other microbes such as bacteria .
For instance , many viruses ( the bacteriophages ) actually infect bacteria .
Some viruses cause infections , while others may be asymptomatic .
Certain viruses are integrated in the human genome .
Viruses evolve rapidly and hence the human virome changes constantly .
Every human being has a unique virome with a unique balance of species .
Lifestyle , age , geographic location , and even the season of the year affects an individual &amp; apos ; s exposure to viruses ; while their susceptibility to disease is effected by preexisting immunity and both viral and human genetics .
The human virome is far from being completely explored and new viruses are discovered frequently . Multiple methods are available for the isolation and study of human viruses : The human virome is not stable and may change over time .
In fact , new viruses are discovered constantly .
With an increasing number of known viruses , diagnosis and treatment of novel viral-associated conditions will become easier as well .
Studying the virome could help improve drug development and limit antibiotic usage . One of the first studies that used high-throughput DNA sequencing to describe the diversity of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses in normal individuals included 706 samples from 102 subjects .
This study detected an average of 5 . 5 viral genera in each individual and these viruses included herpesviruses , papillomaviruses , polyomaviruses , adenoviruses , anelloviruses , parvoviruses , and circoviruses . Each individual had a distinct viral profile , demonstrating the high interpersonal diversity of the virome .
One to 15 viral genera ( average 5 . 5 ) were detected in 92 % of the 102 individuals sampled ( Figure 2 ) .
Figure 3 illustrates the viromes of the 102 individuals defined by sampling up to five major body habitats , showing that a broad range of viruses was detected in healthy people ( Figure 3 ) . The 102 individuals carried seven distinct families of human DNA viruses ( Figure 4A ) .
Sequences were detected predominantly in the nose and skin , similarity to 17 papillomavirus genera ( Figure 4B ) .
Roseoloviruses , predominantly HHV-7 and to a lesser extent HHV-6 , were present among 98 % of the individuals who provided mouth samples . In addition , the same viruses were prevalent in multiple body habitats within individuals .
For instance , the beta- and gamma-papillomaviruses were the viruses most commonly found in the skin and the nose ( anterior nares ; see Figure 4A , B ) , which may reflect proximity and similarities in microenvironments that support infection with these viruses . Whole-genome sequencing data of blood from 8,240 individuals without any clear infectious disease revealed 94 different viruses in 42 % of the study participants .
The sequences included 19 human DNA viruses , proviruses and RNA viruses ( herpesviruses , anelloviruses , papillomaviruses , three polyomaviruses , adenovirus , HIV , HTLV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , parvovirus B19 , and influenza virus ) .
Of possible relevance to transfusion medicine , this study identified Merkel cell polyomavirus in 49 individuals , papillomavirus in blood of 13 individuals , parvovirus B19 in 6 individuals , and the presence of herpesvirus 8 in 3 individuals . The human virome is a part of our bodies and will not always cause harm .
Many latent and asymptomatic viruses are present in the human body all the time .
Viruses infect all life forms ; therefore the bacterial , plant , and animal cells and material in our gut also carry viruses .
When viruses cause harm by infecting the cells in the body , a symptomatic disease may develop .
Contrary to common belief , harmful viruses may be in the minority compared to benign viruses in the human body .
It is much harder to identify viruses than it is to identify bacteria , therefore our understanding of benign viruses in the human body is very rudimentary . The health effects of viruses on an individual are dependent on the individual &amp; apos ; s immune system . Recent research has linked the emerging idea of the hygiene hypothesis to viruses .
This hypothesis attempts to explain and justify some of the high incidences of diseases such as asthma and eczema in the Western world to Western society &amp; apos ; s overuse of antibiotic and antiviral agents .
This overuse potentially disrupts not only the bacteria of the gut but also the viruses that have long lived in harmony with the human body and now play a role in regulation of human health .
This hypothesis generally refers to microorganisms but is now being extended to include airborne viruses and common viral infections of childhood that are becoming increasingly less common . Diverse viruses colonize the human skin and differ by skin site .
These skin virome includes human viruses ( i . e .
human papillomavirus ) and bacteriophages ( bacterial viruses ) that infect commensal skin bacteria such as Staphylococci .
Virus communities differ by moisture levels and degree of protection from the external environment . Many studies have demonstrated that the bacteria and viruses in the human gut ( the gut microbiome ) can be altered by changes in diet .
One study that focused on bacterial viruses , called bacteriophages , in the gut found a significant relationship between diet and the type of bacteriophages present .
This was done by comparing the distance between bacteriophage gut communities in individuals both before and after they started a controlled diet .
The results were that the distance between the bacteriophage gut communities of individuals on the same diet was significantly smaller at the end of their dietary treatment than it was at the start , while there was no increase in community similarity for individuals on different diets over time .
Point Atkinson LighthousePoint Atkinson Lighthouse was built in 1914 on granite boulders jutting out into Burrard Inlet in West Vancouver , Canada .
The reinforced concrete structure replaces an earlier wood structure built in 1875 .
The concrete structure was considered at the time innovative in lighthouse design .
It is now automated and still in use .
The Point Atkinson Lighthouse may be reached by hiking the Valley Trail in Lighthouse Park . &amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ;
Uncle GrandpaUncle Grandpa is an American animated television series created by Peter Browngardt .
The series ran on Cartoon Network from September 2 , 2013 to June 30 , 2017 .
It is based on Browngardt &amp; apos ; s animated short of the same name from &amp; quot ; The Cartoonstitute &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; Uncle Grandpa &amp; quot ; is also a spin-off of &amp; quot ; Secret Mountain Fort Awesome &amp; quot ; , which was in turn a spin-off of the Cartoonstitute short .
It is produced by Cartoon Network Studios . The show is a surreal action-adventure comedy that relies extensively on visual gags and catchphrases .
Creator Pete Browngardt has cited the work of cartoonists Don Martin , Gary Larson and Robert Crumb , as well as Golden Age-era animators such as Tex Avery and Max Fleischer when it came to developing the style of the show .
Each 11-minute episode is presented in a unique format , consisting of a main seven- to nine-minute story , some short bumpers typically composed of a quick visual joke , and an original short that focuses on the show &amp; apos ; s side-characters . With a ploy , Cartoon Network renewed the series for the fourth and fifth seasons : first splitting the second season ( of 52 episodes ) into two halves , which respectively became the second and third season , then also dividing in half the already announced third season into the fourth and fifth season ( of 26 and 23 episodes , respectively ) , which served as the final seasons . The &amp; quot ; Uncle Grandpa &amp; quot ; pilot was created by former &amp; quot ; Chowder &amp; quot ; storyboard artist Peter Browngardt , who first pitched the idea to Cartoon Network in 2006 .
Browngardt , who grew up the youngest in a large family of eight children ( his eldest brother Tom would go on to work as the show &amp; apos ; s film editor ) , based the character upon the various and often eccentric relatives who would often drop by and visit them , as well as aspects of his own personality .
The style of the show was inspired by his love of comics and Warner Bros .
cartoons .
The pilot was produced in 2008 , but aired online in 2009 on Cartoon Network Video as part of &amp; quot ; The Cartoonstitute &amp; quot ; .
Akin to the &amp; quot ; Regular Show &amp; quot ; pilot , the &amp; quot ; Uncle Grandpa &amp; quot ; pilot was successful , but it had yet to have been green-lit into its own series .
In 2011 , the TV series &amp; quot ; Secret Mountain Fort Awesome &amp; quot ; ( based on the creatures that appear in the original short ) aired on Cartoon Network , but was not as well-received as the other &amp; quot ; Cartoon Network &amp; quot ; series at the time , and was eventually put on hiatus in February 2012 .
Despite the failure , &amp; quot ; Secret Mountain Fort Awesome &amp; quot ; went on to win several awards , including the coveted Crystal Award for &amp; quot ; Best Television Production &amp; quot ; at Annecy International Animated Film Festival , the first US-based production to do so .
This helped boost Browngardt &amp; apos ; s profile in getting &amp; quot ; Uncle Grandpa &amp; quot ; greenlit as a series .
Finally , another factor that has contributed to the launch of the show was the redesign of the character by John Kricfalusi , &amp; quot ; The Ren &amp; amp ; Stimpy Show &amp; quot ; s creator . On July 27 and 28 , 2013 , Cartoon Network aired a sneak peek of the series as part of Big Fan Weekend , along with &amp; quot ; Clarence &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Steven Universe &amp; quot ; . Uncle Grandpa , the magical uncle and grandpa who is the uncle-grandpa and brother-dad of every child and adult in the world , stops by children &amp; apos ; s houses every day to see how they are doing .
The children he visits have a problem of their own and Uncle Grandpa tries to help them through a series of chaotic and surreal misadventures .
He is a clowny sort of person who sometimes eats inedible objects ( paper , and mostly books ) .
He drives / lives in a recreational vehicle ( RV ) and is accompanied by a red talking fanny pack named Belly Bag , an anthropomorphic dinosaur named Mr .

Wilmington riot of 1968The Wilmington Riot of 1968 occurred in Wilmington , Delaware , in April of that year following the assassination of Martin Luther King , Jr . .
The riot did not cause any fatalities , though there were numerous injuries , arrests , and buildings burned . Prior to the events of the late 1960s , tensions were already running high in Wilmington .
The flight of white city dwellers to the suburbs , migration of southern blacks to the city , and lingering bad feelings from the construction of I-95 resulted in a divided city , and attempts by local leaders to alleviate the social issue plaguing the city were unsuccessful .
Heightened racial tensions and altercations in July 1967 were followed by two days of sporadic vandalism , looting , and firebombing .
At the request of Wilmington mayor John Babiarz , state police were summoned to increase patrols .
For his part , Governor Charles L .
Terry ( a southern-style Democrat ) publicly warned of minority violence and conspiracies and placed fifteen hundred National Guardsmen on standby alert at Wilmington ’ s airport .
He also proposed and signed legislation granting him sole authority to impose martial law and ban the sale of alcohol and established a riot commission .
In addition to the Delaware National Guard , the Governor activated the entire Delaware State Police Department .
All days off were canceled , vacations were canceled and all troopers were to report to their assigned Troop .
The Delaware State Police who were nearest to the City of Wilmington were sent to Troop 2 located south of the city .
Only a skeleton force was left at the other Troops located in New Castle County .
The Troopers who were assigned to Kent and Sussex counties Troops were sent to Troop 2 .
Once the lower county Troopers arrived at Troop 2 they were paired with those of New Castle County .
Any request for law enforcement assistance from the Wilmington Police Department was sent to Troop 2 . In the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King , Jr .
on April 4 , 1968 , a large number of black youths converged on the main downtown business area of Wilmington and began looting stores April 9 – 10 , 1968 .
A report of sniper fire prompted Democratic mayor Babiarz to declare a state of emergency , to impose a curfew , and to request assistance from Governor Terry .
The two-day riot that occurred after the assassination was small compared with riots in other cities , but its aftermath highlighted the depth of Wilmington ’ s racial problem . On April 9 , 1968 , Governor Terry ordered the twenty-eight-hundred-strong National Guard to patrol the streets of Wilmington and to restore order .
He later ordered National Guard troops to be deployed also in Rehoboth Beach and at the campus of the predominantly black Delaware State College in Dover .
Within a week , Mayor Babiarz requested withdrawal of the soldiers , but Governor Terry refused , citing unspecified intelligence reports of the potential of renewed and more violent racial disturbances . Despite repeated requests by Mayor Babiarz and other notables to remove the National Guard , Governor Terry responded , “ The Guard is going to stay in Wilmington until we ’ re sure people and property owners are adequately protected . ” As a result , Babiarz openly broke with Terry and Wilmington remained under military occupation for the remainder of 1968 – nine months – reportedly the longest occupation of an American city by armed forces since the Civil War . When the Governor decided to activate the Delaware National Guard he also decided that the Delaware State Police should be part of any Guard unit sent into the City of Wilmington .
Delaware State Troopers were with each group sent into the City to ensure that there was a law enforcement representative who could assist the soldiers make informed decisions concerning the use of force .
The participating units were helpful in protecting the fire departments who were responding to the numerous fires that had been set by rioters .
Reports of firemen hearing gun shots forced many fire fighters to withdraw from fighting fires until the units could protect them .
After several days of rioting and intervention by many agencies , the City of Wilmington began to quiet down .
However , the Governor had declared that he would keep the city safe .
He instituted an order to have three Delaware State Troopers and multiple vehicles manned by Delaware National Guardsmen patrol the streets of Wilmington .
Each unit could respond as needed with sufficient force to quell almost any level of threat .
The units worked in support of the Wilmington Police Department in addition to having independent authority to act on their own .
The three units became known as the &amp; quot ; Rat Patrol &amp; quot ; named after the popular T . V .
series by the same name .
The &amp; quot ; Rat Patrol &amp; quot ; patrolled the streets of Wilmington until Governor Peterson took office . The severity of the disorder in Wilmington following King ’ s assassination is questionable .
One writer claimed that “ 21 buildings were destroyed by fire , 40 people were injured , … 154 citizens were arrested , ” and arms caches were found .
On the other hand , another writer asserted that “ only a dozen persons were reportedly injured and property damage was minimal . ” The historian Carol Hoffecker concluded that “ the Wilmington riot was a small , short-lived affair that did relatively little damage . ” Whatever the case , the prolonged military occupation of Wilmington received nationwide attention , increasingly tarnished the city ’ s image , and became an embarrassment to Wilmington ’ s corporate elite , who unsuccessfully tried to persuade Terry to pull the National Guard out .
In November 1968 – six months after the riots – the National Guard was still patrolling Wilmington over the objections of city leaders , who accused the governor of playing to white fears in an election year .
City Supervisor O .
Francis Biondi told the New York Times , “ the National Guard here has become a symbol of white suppression of the black community .
That may be a useful way to get elected , but who wants to … run a city under those circumstances ? ” When Governor Terry sought to discredit the Biracial Coordinating Committee , comprising corporate representatives , the committee publicly stated that the National Guard patrols “ create an aura of police state repression which is drastically reducing the effectiveness of longtime programs aimed at correcting the urban conditions that cause riots . ” The 1968 Delaware gubernatorial campaign was dominated by the issue of the National Guard in Wilmington .
After his defeat by Russell Peterson for reelection in November , lame-duck governor Terry still refused to withdraw the National Guard .
It was left to Governor Peterson , and within an hour of his inauguration in January 1969 he signed the order finally ending the military occupation of Wilmington . The riot intensified suburban fears of the city and set the stage for the deep animosities that developed during the 1970s over interdistrict school desegregation and the relocation of the region ’ s primary health care facility .
Janet Taylor SpenceJanet Taylor Spence ( August 29 , 1923 – March 16 , 2015 ) was an American psychologist who worked in the field of the psychology of anxiety and in gender studies . Janet Taylor Spence was born on August 29 , 1923 in Toledo , Ohio .
She was the older of two daughters .
Her sister was born in 1927 .
Her father , John Chrichton , and her mother , Helen Taylor , were both active members of their community .
Janet Taylor Spence &amp; apos ; s parents met in New York where John was working as a reporter and Helen was studying for a master &amp; apos ; s degree in economics at Columbia University .
John joined the school board after running for governor , and Helen worked with the League of Women Voters . Spence received her undergraduate degree in Psychology at Oberlin College in 1945 .
The fall after finishing her bachelor &amp; apos ; s degree , she began a graduate program at Yale University , which she left for the New York Rotating Internship Program .
It is here that she changed and better developed her interests from clinical practice to human behavior .
She later transferred to the University of Iowa .
Yale proved to be an important part of her life as it was where she met her future husband and co-creator of the Hull-Spence Hypothesis of discrimination learning , Kenneth Spence .
While at the University of Iowa , she worked as his graduate student doing anxiety research .
It &amp; apos ; s important to note that while attending Yale University as a clinical student , Spence worked under Clark L .
Hull , the predominant learning theorist of his era . An extension of the Hull-Spence Hypothesis , her dissertation studied the possibility of anxiety being a dispositional trait .
&amp; quot ; Quite simply , I investigated whether chronically anxious individuals would classically condition more rapidly that less anxious individuals , ” she explained .
One of her accomplishments was creating an instrument to measure her hypothesis .
This instrument , called the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale , “ consisted of 50 statements that were indicative of manifest anxiety when answered a certain way , ” and is one of her most acknowledged pieces , especially because it was the first of its kind .
She graduated in 1949 with a Ph . D .
in Psychology . After graduation , Spence accepted a position as a psychology instructor at Northwestern University .
In 1951 , her first article , &amp; quot ; Anxiety and strength of UCS as determiners of the amount of eyelid conditioning , ” was published with Kenneth Spence as the co-author .
In the same year , her first independently authored article , &amp; quot ; The relationship of anxiety to the conditioned eyelid response , &amp; quot ; was published .
She later received associate professor standing and stayed at this job until 1960 .
She first experienced gender discrimination in the work force when she began teaching at Northwestern University .
She was given the opportunity to be the first female faculty member because , as Janet Taylor Spence said , “ the chair of the university thought ‘ having a woman on the faculty was a novel and interesting idea , ’ ” against the belief of some of the other faculty members .
She also worked as a statistics professor and wrote a statistics textbook . Janet Taylor Spence and Kenneth Spence were married on December 27 , 1959 and moved to Iowa shortly after .
As she was female and unable to get a job at the Department of Psychology of the University of Iowa , she was hired by the Veterans Hospital in Iowa City as a research psychologist .
While working at the VA Hospital , she was able to expand her interests to the study of schizophrenia .
In 1964 , she and her husband moved to Austin , Texas for his job at the University of Texas .
Just like in Iowa , because she was female , she was unable to get a job at the university .
She accepted a job at an institution for the mentally handicapped called the Austin State School .
While there , she began a number of studies with normal and mentally handicapped children .
She was later offered a position at the University of Texas by the Department of Educational Psychology .
She went on to replace the chair of the Department of Psychology . Her husband died on January 12 , 1967 , but that did not slow down her progress .
In 1970 , Spence was elected to the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) .
Two years later , she became the president of the Southwestern Psychological Association .
In 1974 , she began editing Contemporary Psychology , where she had started as an associate editor to Gardner Lindzey five years prior .
During the mid to late 1970s , she was on the Board of Directors for the APA .
She also became the sixth female president of the APA in 1985 . In 1989 , she founded and became the first elected president of the American Psychological Society ( now the Association for Psychological Science ) .
She was awarded the 1993 National Academy of Sciences Award for Excellence in Scientific Reviewing .
She has been awarded three honorary doctorates from Oberlin College , Ohio State University and the University of Toledo .
She also received the American Psychological Foundation ’ s 2004 Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology ( American Psychologist , 2004 ) .
She has been a visiting research professor at Harvard twice .
She has claimed that &amp; quot ; as children and teenagers , my sister and I were fully exposed to all these activities . . . perhaps it was due to the exposure to the human suffering so common during the Depression and my parents &amp; apos ; concern with it that as a young adolescent I decided I wanted to become a psychologist &amp; quot ; . In 2009 , the Janet Taylor Spence Award for Transformative Early Career Contributions was established by the APS Board of Directors to recognize transformative contributions to psychological science by rising stars in the field .
The award is a fitting tribute to Spence , who developed new approaches to research and pioneering tools including the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Attitudes Toward Women Scale , as well as crossing disciplinary boundaries with work on topics ranging from schizophrenia to developmental psychology to gender bias .

Central Committee of National Jihad in PalestineThe Central Committee of National Jihad in Palestine was the nominal political and organizational body of the 1936 – 39 Arab revolt in Palestine .
It was founded during the second stage of the revolt in November 1937 .
The Damascus-based Central Committee was founded by Palestinian Arab leaders exiled from the British Mandate of Palestine by the authorities , chief of whom was Izzat Darwaza .
The intended purpose of the committee was to provide funds and guidance to the revolt &amp; apos ; s leaders on the ground , who were largely of rural origin and acted more or less autonomously from the committee and each other . Because the leaders of the Central Committee were exiled , centralized authority over the revolt proved difficult to establish .
The Damascus-based leadership and the mostly rural rebels fighting inside Palestine espoused different political outlooks and this further strained the Committee &amp; apos ; s attempts to influence rebel actions .
Only three of the main rebel leaders in Palestine maintained a collaborative relationship with the Central Committee , while about a dozen others operated beyond the organization &amp; apos ; s influence . The Central Committee was led by Izzat Darwaza , an exiled teacher , historian and founding member of al-Istiqlal ( &amp; quot ; Independence Party &amp; quot ; ) .
Later , Jamal al-Husayni , the head of the Palestine Arab Party , former Istiqlal member Akram Zuaiter and guerrilla leader Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni joined Darwaza in the committee .
The organization was highly influenced by the exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and the head of Arab Higher Committee ( dissolved by the British authorities in late 1937 ) , Mohammad Amin al-Husayni . The veteran pan-Arab guerrilla leader Fawzi al-Qawuqji and his deputy Muhammad al-Ashmar were invited to lead the rebellion by the Committee and the Grand Mufti , but did not accept the role .
Al-Qawuqji had previously served as the revolt &amp; apos ; s leader on the ground , at least nominally , in 1936 .
In general , the local rebel leaders fighting in Palestine were wary of outside leaders as well as each other .
According to Darwaza , &amp; quot ; Each commander defined his area of his operations , which he saw as his own sphere of influence .
He would become upset if a neighboring leadership encroached into his area in a way that he saw as a violation of jurisdiction . &amp; quot ; In late 1938 the rebels formed a central military command structure called the Bureau of the Arab Revolt in Palestine , which would serve as the Central Committee &amp; apos ; s military arm .
However , the growing rivalry between Abd al-Rahim al-Hajj Muhammad and Arif Abd al-Raziq impeded the Bureau &amp; apos ; s operations and coordination .
The two were designated the rotational role of General Commander of the Revolt .
The two other commanders serving on the Bureau were Yusuf Abu Durra of the Haifa-Wadi Ara region and Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir of the Upper Galilee . In February 1939 al-Hajj Muhammad was confirmed as the sole General Commander by the Central Committee .
He was killed fighting British troops and allied Arab &amp; quot ; peace bands &amp; quot ; near Jenin in late March .
Following his death , the Central Committee appointed Ahmad al-Hasan as General Commander , although this did little to boost rebel morale and the revolt dissipated by the winter of 1939 .

Crowdfunding exemption movementThe crowdfunding exemption movement in the U . S .
is the effort to exempt relatively small investment offerings ( typically $ 1 million or less ) , sold to the general public in small blocks , from the registration and compliance requirements demanded of large public companies .
Inspired by the growth of non-investment crowdfunding , advocates see such exemptions as a way to spur innovation , economic activity , and small-business job creation , but opponents see such changes as invitations to fraud that will target unsophisticated investors .
The movement has seen success with the passage of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act and a growing number of state-level exemptions , but as of April 2013 , the federal law has not yet gone into effect . The first big push towards an equity crowdfunding exemption came in April 2010 , when Paul Spinrad of &amp; quot ; Make &amp; quot ; magazine , Jenny Kassan of the Sustainable Economies Law Center ( SELC ) , and Danae Ringelmann of Indiegogo launched the Crowdfunding Campaign to Change Crowdfunding Law to fund the legal work to draft a petition to the U . S .
Securities and Exchange Commission for a crowdfunding exemption .
After the campaign met its funding goal , SELC interns Aroma Sharma and Kathleen Kenney researched and wrote the petition , which lists the names of all of its financial supporters in the first footnote .
The SEC posted the petition as File No .
4-605 on July 1 , 2010 . To limit abuse and protect investors , the SELC petition proposed a $ 100k cap on the entire offering , and a $ 100 cap on individual investments .
Other crowdfunding exemption proposals followed the same two-cap strategy .
The lobbying group Startup Exemption , led by Jason Best , Sherwood Neiss and Zak Cassady-Dorion , proposed crowdfunding exemption caps of $ 1m for the total offering and $ 10k or 10 % of income for each individual investment to the SEC in December 2010 , and in early 2011 to the Startup America initiative , which was launched by the White House to celebrate , inspire , and accelerate high-growth entrepreneurship throughout the nation .
Sherwood Neiss was asked to testify twice in Congress .
His congressional testimony reviewed the pros and cons of crowdfunding . Through 2011 , with the assistance of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council and a newsworthy endorsement from Whoopi Goldberg , the Startup Exemption met with members of Congress , White House staff , and others to lobby for a crowdfunding exemption .
The Startup Exemption &amp; apos ; s $ 1m / $ 10k caps were repeated in the White House &amp; apos ; s first crowdfunding exemption endorsement , on Sept 8 , 2011 , and in the first crowdfunding bill , the Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act introduced by Rep .
Patrick McHenry ( R-NC ) on September 14 , 2011 .
As his initial inspiration for H . R . 2930 , McHenry points to the website BuyaBeerCompany . com , which launched in Nov 2009 and gathered over 5 million pledges for a notional group purchase of the Pabst Brewing Company before being shut down by the SEC . The White House endorsed the Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act on November 1 , 2011 and it passed the House the following day with a vote of 407-17 .
In the Senate , two new crowdfunding bills followed : S . 1791 , with caps of $ 1m and $ 1k , and S . 1970 , with a total offering cap of $ 1m , and a tiered individual cap ranging from $ 500 to 1 % of income to 2 % of income , depending on the investor &amp; apos ; s annual income .
Around the same time , academic proposals for a crowdfunding exemption included $ 250 – 500k total and $ 500 or 2 % of income individual , proposed by Steven Bradford , and $ 250k total and $ 1000 individual per six months , proposed by Nikki D .
Pope . The Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act , H . R . 2930 , became part of the JOBS Act in March 2012 .
The JOBS Act went through a number of amendments ; the most significant of these was when the Senate replaced the H . R . 2930 section with a version of S . 1970 that was modified by raising its tiered individual investment caps to $ 2000 , 5 % , and 10 % of income .
On April 5 , 2012 President Barack Obama signed the JOBS Act into law .
The signing ceremony , in the White House Rose Garden , was attended by many members of the &amp; quot ; crowdfunding crowd &amp; quot ; that collectively lobbied for the exemption . Many states have enacted ( or are in various stages of enacting / considering ) their own intrastate crowdfunding exemption laws .
As of July 2016 , thirty-one ( 31 ) states have intrastate crowdfunding exemptions in place and seven ( 7 ) states are in various stages of enacting / considering sponsored legislation regarding such intrastate crowdfunding .
To date only one ( 1 ) state has reviewed , and rejected , an intrastate crowdfunding exemption .
Based on available information to date , the remaining states do not appear to be investigating the possibility of enacting an intrastate crowdfunding exemption .
Anthony J .
Zeoli , an Illinois attorney who drafted the intrastate crowdfunding exemption bill approved in Illinois , maintains an active database of all active and proposed intrastate crowdfunding exemption laws , as well as comparitave summaries of each . Intrastate crowdfunding exemptions provide issuers of securities with several advantages over the federal crowdfunding exemption found in the JOBS Act , Title III .
First , for those companies residing in one of the states where an exemption has been put into place , securities based crowdfunding campaigns can be run today , without the need for businesses to wait on the SEC &amp; apos ; s rule making process .
Second , the overall cost of capital associated with raising money under the JOBS Act crowdfunding exemption is estimated to be approximately $ 39,000 for a $ 100,000 crowdfunding campaign .
Most of this cost is a consequence of the requirements for the issuers to have certified or audited financial statements , go through a FINRA registered broker / dealer or funding portal , and produce expensive disclosure materials for investors .
By contrast , a similar capital raise under an intrastate exemption is likely to be significantly cheaper for a similar campaign as a result of the absence of many of these requirements at the state level . The intrastate crowdfunding exemptions also carry certain disadvantages for companies wishing to run a crowdfunding campaign .
Principally , companies must be domiciled in the state in which they wish to run the campaign , and may not offer securities to any potential investors who are located outside of such state .
This restriction significantly curtails the potential audience that a crowdfunding campaign might reach .
In addition , although the SEC has recently provided guidance on how issuers may protect themselves from making &amp; apos ; accidental offers &amp; apos ; to residents that are not located within the issuer &amp; apos ; s state , compliance with the SEC Rule 147 ( the intrastate exemption ) can still be a technically challenging and legally difficult prospect . Certain broad based and niche platforms are currently operating in the intrastate crowdfunding space as funding portals and crowdfunding consultants .
Georgia was the first state to permit intrastate securities based crowdfunding through portals , and the first successful securities based crowdfunding transaction in the United States in over 80 years , was posted on the Georgia intrastate only platform SparkMarket in October 2013 .
The campaign — run by Georgia-based Bohemian Guitars — raised approximately $ 129,000 .
Georgia currently has several operational general and market niche platforms . The first successful intrastate crowdfunding campaign pursuant to the Michigan Invests Locally Act ( the MILE Act ) was run by the Tecumseh Brewing Co . , and was successfully closed at $ 175,000 , in May 2014 , on the multi-state platform Localstake . Under the Illinois Intrastate Offering Exemption the Secretary of State has approved the application of VestLo as a registered crowdfunding portal effective August 2016 .

Fort Monroe ( Yosemite ) Fort Monroe is a historic site in Yosemite National Park .
There are no longer remnants , it is a location only .
The fort was not a military fort , but started as a stage station .
As various buildings were added or demolished , the general location acquired and kept the name well into the automobile age .
Prior to the building of the Wawona Tunnel in 1933 , the Wawona Road passed next to it , at the point where the start of Pohono Trail was located .
( Currently the Pohono Trail includes part of what was the old Wawona Road . ) Fort Monroe was named for George F .
Monroe , a stage driver for the Yosemite Stage Line .
The &amp; quot ; fort &amp; quot ; was a stage team relay station , and a place where stage line customers and other travelers camped . Monroe came to California with his uncle from his native Georgia in 1856 to meet his parents who had recently moved to Mariposa as part of the gold rush .
George was 12 at the time .
George &amp; apos ; s father Louis became a successful barber in Mariposa , and eventually bought and lived on a prosperous ranch south east of town . In 1866 Monroe started working for the Wabash brothers , who ran the Yosemite Stage Line , and eventually got promoted to driver .
He was said to excel at taking the team over the treacherous road , which included many sharp drop offs at the side of the road and numerous tight switch backs .
He never had an accident that cost the company money nor injury to his passengers .
It is thought that an accident precipitated his own death at the age of 42 .
According to one account , he was riding as a passenger in the stage when a horse got away from the driver , and George clambered to the front horse to stop the team , in the course of which he injured himself .
A few days later , after complaining of feeling ill , he died at his parents ranch .
He was their only child . Monroe was said to be well known to travelers from Europe , as well as throughout the United States .
Among his passengers over the years were presidents Grant , Garfield and Hayes . The location retained Monroe &amp; apos ; s name after his death .
It was always a site of significance , from the stage and horse era of the late 19th century , well into the automobile era when for a time it was an entrance station , and was said to have a fine automobile camp .
When the Wawona Tunnel was built , the upper road was converted into part of the Pohono Trail , whose starting point is now located at the Tunnel View parking lot . Monroe Meadows , in Yosemite Valley near Bridalveil Falls , is also named for George Monroe .

Military acute concussion evaluationThe Military Acute Concussion Evaluation ( MACE ) is a medical screening and documentation measure that is used to gauge the severity of symptoms and cognitive deficits after a diagnosis of a concussion has been made .
Taking less than 15 minutes to administer , it involves collecting a history of the injury event and the symptoms experienced at that time , followed by a brief neurological screening , and a similarly short cognitive test .
The score is presented with a listing of symptoms endorsed and a red or green light regarding the neurological screen .
All cases of a concussion result in mandatory restricted duty for 24 hours followed by immediate reevaluation via the MACE .
Similarly , the MACE is most effective if given within 24 hours of the injury event to fully gauge the level of possible brain injury .
The MACE has been distributed to all branches of the US military .
It is currently used in DVBIC and the US Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Veterans Health Administration are partners in clinical care , education , research and care coordination for veterans and active-duty service members who have sustained a traumatic brain injury .
Phillip PaulwellThe Honourable Phillip Paulwell ( born 14 January 1962 ) is a Jamaican politician .
Paulwell is the current Member of Parliament for the constituency of Kingston East and Port Royal and former Minister of Science , Technology , Energy and Mining STEM in the People &amp; apos ; s National Party administration , which has formed the Government of Jamaica following the party &amp; apos ; s electoral victory in the December 2011 General Elections . Paulwell is also the sitting President of the Caribbean Telecommunications Union ( CTU ) and the Chairman of the PNP &amp; apos ; s Region 3 , a position he has held since 2006 . An attorney-at-law by profession , Paulwell started his political career in 1995 as a Senator and Minister of State in the Ministry of Industry Investment and Commerce under the then governing PNP administration . In the 1997 General Elections he was elected to the House of Representatives as Member of Parliament for the constituency of Kingston East and Port Royal and was appointed to the executive as Minister of Commerce and Technology under the PJ Patterson-led administration .
Paulwell again successfully contested the Kingston East and Port Royal constituency in the October 2002 General Elections , and was named Minister of Industry , Commerce and Technology . Although Paulwell was one of 28 PNP candidates to retain a seat in the House of Representatives in the General Elections of 2007 , the Jamaica Labour Party ( JLP ) , with its 32 seat majority , won the elections and formed the government for the first time in 18 years . In the December 2011 General Elections , the PNP , led by Portia Simpson Miller , won a majority 42 of 62 Parliamentary seats , one of those being the Kingston East and Port Royal seat , which Paulwell won by a landslide , tallying a majority of 8,050 votes to his opponent &amp; apos ; s 1,530 .
When the Government was formed on 6 January 2012 , Paulwell was named Minister of Energy , Mining , Science and Technology . In 2006 , Paulwell successfully contested an internal PNP election , for the position of Chairman of the party &amp; apos ; s Region 3 , which encompasses electoral constituencies in the country &amp; apos ; s capital , Kingston and St Andrew . In April 2001 , Paulwell , who was at the time the Jamaican Minister of Industry , Commerce and Technology , instructed the Jamaican Office of Utilities Regulation ( OUR ) to refrain from interfering with the rates charged for fixed to mobile ( FTM ) calls .
Paulwell personally intervened in March 2002 by calling the OUR Director General , Winston Hay , telling him that a fourth telecommunications provider was interested in investing in Jamaica , but would only do so if the FTM rates stayed the same .
After Hay refused , Paulwell issued a Direction which restricted the role of the OUR in setting the rates and tariffs on interconnection .
It was later reported that Paulwell had only demanded the OUR forgo changing the FTM rates following a complaint from Digicel , after the OUR had directed Digicel to alter its fees . Following a judicial review , it was ruled that Paulwell had no power to issue the Direction to the OUR , and although Digicel successfully appealed at the Supreme Court , that ruling was overturned after the Court of Appeal ruled that Paulwell &amp; apos ; s Direction fell outside his ministerial authority and was invalid , and the OUR did not have to comply with it .
Digicel &amp; apos ; s last attempt appeal to the Privy Council was also unsuccessful : the Privy Council again ruled that Paulwell ’ s Direction was outside his ministerial powers . Leaked United States Government cables sent from the US Embassy in Kingston on 19 March 2008 linked Paulwell to a number of scandals .
According to one cable , Paulwell &amp; quot ; has been behind the scenes of numerous imbroglios &amp; quot ; , including the NetServ scandal , the Cement Fiasco , and the Cuban light bulb scandal .
The cable goes on to state that &amp; quot ; despite all the innuendos , and accusations , Paulwell has never been charged with a crime . &amp; quot ; Paulwell was at the centre of a telecoms scandal in 2007 , after he noted that the sale of Jamaica &amp; apos ; s fourth cellular licence would go to a company known as Solutrea Jamaica Limited .
Solutrea was to pay approximately US $ 7 . 5million for the licence .
However , when it became unclear whether Solutrea had paid in the full sum , it emerged that Paulwell had issued the licence without all the required public agencies agreeing to the sale .
It was further uncovered that Minnette Palmer , an advisor to Paulwell , owned a company which was a shareholder of Solutrea . According to a US diplomatic cable , Paulwell was at the centre of a scandal after it emerged that the Jamaican government had accrued a bill of more the US $ 3 . 95 million for the distribution of some four million energy saving fluorescent light bulbs donated by the Government of Cuba to the people of Jamaica .
The matter was turned over to the Jamaican Director of Public Prosecutions and the Fraud Squad following allegations that Paulwell , the then-Minister of Energy , Industry and Commerce , and Kern Spencer , then-Minister of State within the Energy Ministry , awarded lucrative contracts for nationwide distribution of the bulbs to two companies which only recently had been incorporated by personal friend or relatives .
A government investigation into the affair absolved Paulwell of any wrongdoing . In 2006 , the Jamaica Labour Party moved to censure Paulwell in Parliament over the defective cement fiasco .
The fiasco began when the Caribbean Cement Company ( CCC ) recalled 500 tonnes of faulty product it had released into the market .
Paulwell , at the time the industry and commerce minister , was accused of negligence and gross dereliction of duty , and there were calls from the opposition on him to tender his resignation as Minister .
One accusation levelled at Paulwell was that , despite recommendations from the Jamaican Bureau of Standards , he had failed to exercise his Ministerial authority to declare that the production of cement must conform to the Bureau &amp; apos ; s certification programme .
Prior to its privatisation in 2003 , the CCC was under a certification programme .
He was also accused of providing false information and misleading Parliament .
A US cable stated that the fiasco nearly crippled the booming construction industry because of severe shortages . According to a US cable , in 2001 , Paulwell was at the centre of a controversial loan to NetServ , an IT firm which subsequently collapsed .
Paulwell approved a J $ 180 million loan of public funds to NetServ without matching equity and after a due diligence report raised serious questions about the business conduct of the company &amp; apos ; s principal , Paul Pereira .
NetServ received a J $ 90 million cheque in 2000 to enable it to carry out start-up operations .
In February 2001 , just before a second payment was due , JAMPRO , the government &amp; apos ; s investment promotion agency , sent two reports to Paulwell &amp; apos ; s Ministry and the NIBJ raising concerns about the operations of NetServ and Paul Pereira .
However , the Ministry &amp; apos ; s loan committee still decided to go through with the second payment to the company .
Paulwell later admitted that it was an error not to insist that the company put up US $ 6 million in equity before the National Investment Bank of Jamaica granted it the original loan .

Niederdollendorf stationNiederdollendorf railway station is a station on the East Rhine Railway ( ) in the Königswinter suburb of Niederdollendorf in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis district of North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany .
It is a protected as a monument .
The station was opened on 11 July 1870 as part of the extension of the East Rhine Railway from Neuwied to Oberkassel . At its core is the entrance building , which is a two-story brick building built in 1898 .
To its north and south it is bordered by single-storey extensions .
The station restaurant is in the southern extension .
The northern extension was built later to house rail services .
The upper floor of the main building was designed to accommodate rail service apartments .
The station has a gabled central avant-corps and the windows and the portals have rounded tops .
The facades are decorated with cornices attached to the gable and terracotta friezes .
The platform canopies have cast iron columns . About 50 metres to the north of the station building is an operations building , which was built also of brick in 1910 for the handling of freight .
The hip roof of the building is provided with dormers .
Its knee wall is made of timber .
The handling of freight at Niederdollendorf station was gradually abandoned in the 1940s and 1950s .
It had been the terminus of the narrow-gauge Heisterbach Valley Railway , which closed in 1942 . The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station .

The station is served hourly by Regional-Express service RE 8 ( Rhein-Erft-Express ) and Regionalbahn service RB 27 ( Rhein-Erft-Bahn ) , which complement each another to provide an approximate half-hourly service .
Henry of AstiHenry of Asti ( &amp; quot ; Enrico d &amp; apos ; Asti &amp; quot ; ; died 17 January 1345 ) was the titular Roman Catholic patriarch of Constantinople from 1339 and bishop of Negroponte in Frankish Greece .
His fame rests on his leadership of the first Smyrniote crusade ( 1342 – 45 ) , on which he died . In February 1341 , Pope Benedict XII ordered him to receive some procurators representing the Catalan Grand Company , which wished to return to &amp; quot ; the bosom of the mother Church &amp; quot ; . In 1342 , Henry negotiated an alliance between King Hugh IV of Cyprus and the Knights Hospitaler against the Turkish ruler Umur Beg of Aydin .
On 2 November 1342 , he delivered a papal letter to the doge of Venice , Bartolomeo Gradenigo , asking him to join the league and appointing Cardinal Guillaume Court apostolic legate to Venice .
On 31 August , Pope Clement VI officially named Henry his legate for the upcoming crusade against Smyrna , &amp; quot ; because of the great and important business &amp; # 91 ; he conducted &amp; # 93 ; in Greece &amp; quot ; .
He was to travel , as commander-in-chief , with the Genoese fleet under Martino Zaccaria , who was named captain-general , but whom Henry had authority to remove if need be .
In the summer of 1343 , the Duke John I of the Archipelago informed Henry in a letter that he wished to supply a galley to the expedition . On 21 October 1343 , Henry was charged with keeping the peace in the Duchy of Athens between the ducal claimant Count Walter VI of Brienne and the occupying forces of the Catalan Company , with whom he had previous experience from 1341 .
As the crusade dragged on into 1344 , Henry wrote to the pope describing its &amp; quot ; fortunate progress &amp; quot ; and the pope responded , in a letter dated 25 July , by thanking the Hospitaler grand master , Hélion de Villeneuve , for the assistance he was giving the crusade .
On 18 September the pope ordered Henry to prevent Zaccaria from re-conquering the Lordship of Chios , which his family had lost to the Byzantines after an internal rebellion .
The loss of Chios , the pope thought , would force the Byzantines into an alliance with the Ottomans .
After the fall of the harbour of Smyrna on 28 October 1344 , Henry established his headquarters there and began restoring the fortifications .
Belatedly , on 1 February , Pope Clement congratulated Henry on the victory and on his &amp; quot ; virtuously , constantly and intrepidly &amp; quot ; leading .
He warned about the difficulty of raising funds for the continuance of the crusade , but left the decision on how to proceed to Henry , since the latter , he said , had been taught &amp; quot ; in the school of experience &amp; quot ; .
One of the last actions of the patriarch before his death was to lead , with Zaccaria , a fleet of twelve galleys on a successful foray to captured supplies .
On their return the Ottomans who had been besieging the citadel retreated . Henry was killed on 17 January 1345 .
He had intended to celebrate a victory Mass in a former church ( perhaps the seat of the metropolis ) that the Turks had used as a stable , and which at the time lay between the Christian and Turkish lines .
Although Zaccaria objected to the dangerous venture , he was with Henry at the Mass when the Turks under Umur himself attacked the church .
While most of those present got to the safety of the harbour citadel , Henry , Zaccaria and the Venetian leader , Pietro Zeno , were killed .
Many legends surrounding this event were later current in Italy . When Umur Beg &amp; apos ; s brother and successor , Khidr Beg , signed a peace treaty with the crusaders on 18 August 1348 , he offered to return the body of Henry of Asti whenever they claimed it .

He made his debut as a senior while playing on loan with Kom in the 2009 – 10 season .
He later played the following three seasons in the Montenegrin First League back with Budućnost Podgorica .
During the winter break of the 2012 – 13 season , he mmoved abroad by joining Serbian SuperLiga side Radnički Niš .
In summer 2013 he moved to another Serbian SuperLiga club , FK Spartak Subotica . On 5 July 2015 , Cicmil completed a transfer to Albanian Superliga side Vllaznia Shkodër as a free agent .
He was presented on the same day along with his patriots Andrija Dragojević and Darko Pavićević , with them all signing a one-year contract .
Cicmil made his competitive debut with the team in the opening league match of the season against reigning champions Skënderbeu Korçë , playing the entire match of an eventual 0 – 1 defeat .
He scored his first Vllaznia goal in the All-time Albanian derby against Tirana , a header in the 11th minute after an owngoal six minutes earlier , to lead the team into a 3 – 1 home , the first after eight matches .
Later on 25 April , Cicmil scored again , the opening goal against fellow relegation strugglers Flamurtari Vlorë , as Vllaznia took another 3 points to keep them alive .
Cicmil established himself in the starting lineup , with Vllaznia securing the stay in the league in the matchday 34 , thanks to a 2 – 0 home win over Tërbuni Pukë .

1940 New England hurricaneThe 1940 New England hurricane moved off of the U . S .
East Coast and Atlantic Canada in August and September 1940 , producing strong winds and torrential rainfall .
The fourth tropical cyclone and third hurricane of the season , the storm originated from a well-defined low-pressure area in the open Atlantic Ocean on August 26 .
Moving slowly in a general west-northwest motion , the disturbance intensified , reaching tropical storm strength on August 28 and subsequently hurricane intensity on August 30 .
The hurricane passed within 85 mi ( 135 km ) of Cape Hatteras before recurving towards the northeast .
The hurricane continued to intensify , and reached peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 961 mbar ( hPa ; 28 . 38 inHg ) , though these statistical peaks were achieved at different times on September 2 .
Afterwards , the hurricane began a weakening trend as it proceeded northeastward , and had degenerated into a tropical storm by the time it made its first landfall on Nova Scotia later that day .
The storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the next day while making another landfall on New Brunswick .
The extratropical remnants persisted into Quebec before merging with a larger extratropical system late on September 3 . Despite not making landfall on the United States , the hurricane caused widespread damage .
Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast , particularly in New England .
The heightened precautions were due in part to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior .
Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey , where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall , peaking at 24 in ( 610 mm ) in the town of Ewan .
This would make the storm the wettest in state history .
The resultant floods damaged infrastructure , mostly to road networks .
Damage in the state amounted to $ 4 million .
Farther north in New England , strong winds were reported , though damage remained minimal .
Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada , damage there too was minimal , and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves .
Overall , the hurricane caused seven fatalities . The origins of the hurricane can be traced to a compact and slow-moving low-pressure area in the open Atlantic Ocean in late August 1940 .
As the system progressed in a west-northwest direction , its center of circulation became more organized .
As a result , the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda at 1200 UTC on August 26 .
Operationally , the storm was analyzed to have undergone tropical cyclogenesis on August 30 .
However , a reanalysis of the storm conducted in 2012 found that the system was already organized prior .
In its initial stages , the depression remained weak , with few ships reporting abnormally strong winds in association with the storm .
Continuing in a slow west-northwest movement , the disturbance gradually intensified , and was analyzed to have attained tropical storm intensity by 1800 UTC on August 28 .
At 0600 UTC on August 30 , the tropical storm strengthened further into the equivalent of a modern-day Category 1 hurricane , roughly 225 mi ( 360 km ) east of the Florida peninsula .
At the same time , the hurricane began to intensify and move quicker than it had previously .
Later that day , a ship within the periphery of the storm reported winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 979 mbar ( hPa ; 28 . 90 inHg ) . At 1200 UTC on September 1 , the hurricane attained modern-day Category 2 intensity .
Ships continued to report strong winds and low pressures associated with the storm .
Early on September 1 , the hurricane passed 85 mi ( 135 km ) of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , before recurving towards the northeast and away from the coast .
That same day , two ships reported hurricane-force winds .
At 0200 UTC on September 2 , the American steamboat &amp; quot ; Franklin K .
Lane &amp; quot ; reported a barometric pressure of 965 mbar ( hPa ; 28 . 50 inHg ) while located within the hurricane &amp; apos ; s radius of maximum wind ; this would be the lowest pressure measured in association with the tropical cyclone and the lowest measured in the entire North Atlantic Ocean in September 1940 .
Based on the ship observation , the storm was analyzed to have reached peak intensity on September 2 with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 961 mbar ( hPa ; 28 . 38 inHg ) .
However , stronger winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) were analyzed to have been present in the hurricane earlier .
As it traversed though more northerly latitudes , the storm began to gradually weaken .
The storm made landfall slightly northwest of Yarmouth , Nova Scotia at 2100 UTC later on September 2 as a tropical storm with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) .
After quickly passing over Nova Scotia , the weakening tropical storm transitioned into an extratropical storm over the Bay of Fundy at 0000 UTC on September 3 .
At the same time , the cyclone made a second landfall on New Brunswick as a slightly weaker storm with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) .
The extratropical system progressed over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence before it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm at 1800 UTC later that day in Quebec just north of Anticosti Island . As the hurricane approached the United States East Coast on August 31 , the United States Weather Bureau advised extreme caution to ships between Cape Hatteras and southern areas of New England .
Storm warnings were issued for coastal regions between Wilmington , North Carolina and the Virginia Capes .
These warnings were later extended northward to the Delaware Breakwater .
Strong winds exceeding gale-force were expected for much of the East Coast , particularly for Cape Hatteras .
On September 1 , hurricane warnings were ordered for areas from Hatteras , North Carolina to Pamlico Sound , while previously issued storm warnings remained in place .
On September 2 , gale warnings extended further north into Nantucket , Massachusetts .
In Norfolk , Virginia , city department heads were ordered to stand by for potential emergency duties .
United States Coast Guard personnel were also dispatched along the North Carolina coast .
United States Navy personnel were detained in New London , Connecticut until the storm passed .
In Westhampton , New York , a mass evacuation occurred , involving 10,000 residences .
Air traffic to and from Mitchel Air Force Base was cancelled , and 100 airplanes stationed at the base were fastened to the ground .
Police and firemen evacuated a 50 mi ( 80 km ) stretch of the Rhode Island coastline .
This included Roy Carpenter &amp; apos ; s Beach , where 1,000 families were forced to evacuate .
In Narragansett Bay , boats were sent back to harbors or towed to shore .
The extensive precautionary measures undertaken occurred in part due to fears that the storm would cause similar effects to a destructive hurricane which swept through areas of New England two years prior . On September 1 , the Venezuelan tanker &amp; quot ; Acosta &amp; quot ; relayed an SOS signal while near the hurricane 200 mi ( 320 km ) southeast of the Frying Pan Shoals .
United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk , Virginia and Morehead City , North Carolina dispatched cutters to aid the ship .
Off of the East Coast , an offshoot of the hurricane resulted in the drownings of two people .
In the Mid-Atlantic states , the passing hurricane &amp; apos ; s outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area .
The cyclone &amp; apos ; s flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region , resulting in locally heavy rainfall , particularly in New Jersey , where precipitation peaked at 24 in ( 610 mm ) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September 1 .
This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history .
Most of the rain was in western portions of the state , however , with minimal rainfall at the coast .
The floods caused small rivers to overflow , breaching dams .
An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township , rendering 2,000 people homeless .
Rail service between Philadelphia , Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks .
Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $ 4,000,000 in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone .
Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $ 2,500,000 .
In Camden County , damage was estimated at $ 1 million .
Four fatalities were reported as a result of the floods .
In Delaware , rainfall was comparatively less .
However , rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $ 50,000 in damages and one death .
Further north , strong gusts were reported across New England .
Winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket .
Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) .
In Eastport , Maine , winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) were reported . After the storm , New Jersey state health department investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility for an increase in typhoid fever in flooded areas .
In Woodbury , where the city pumping station was flooded , water was rationed .
Gas service was also limited in Woodbury , Pedricktown , Penns Grove .
As a result of a gas plant becoming inundated in Glassboro , electricity was rationalized in Hammonton , forcing residents to eat uncooked food .
Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due to the high floodwaters . Despite making two separate landfalls in Atlantic Canada on September 2 and September 3 , the hurricane caused minimal damage .
Effects in Nova Scotia were limited to boating incidents .
In Lake Milo , near Yarmouth , six yachts capsized due to the strong winds .
In New Brunswick , damage was also minimal .
A car accident associated with the storm injured a man near Barnesville .

George M .
Randall ( bishop ) The Right Reverend George Maxwell Randall ( November 23 , 1810 – September 28 , 1873 ) was the Episcopal bishop of Missionary District of Colorado and Parts Adjacent . George Randall was born in Warren , Rhode Island , on November 23 , 1810 , the son of Samuel and Martha ( née Maxwell ) Randall .
He attended Brown University , where he graduated in 1835 .
He then undertook theological studies at the General Theological Seminary , from which he graduated in 1838 .
George A .
Jarvis , who was a long-time friend that became a benefactor for a number of Randall &amp; apos ; s programs , donated monies to fund Randall &amp; apos ; s education .
During seminary Randall helped start a Sunday school program . In his hometown of Warren , Randall was ordained a deacon in the Episcopal Church on July 17 , 1838 , and became a priest on November 2 , 1839 . Randall began his ordained ministry by serving as the rector of the Church of the Ascension in Fall River , Massachusetts .
He moved from there to become the rector of the Church of the Messiah in Boston in 1844 .
He remained in this position until he was elevated to the episcopate . While serving in Massachusetts , he was a diocesan deputy to the General Convention from 1850 until 1865 .
In 1862 and 1865 he was elected the Secretary to the House of Clerical and Lay Deputies , to which he had previously served as Assistant Secretary . In 1856 he received his Doctor of Sacred Theology degree from Brown University .
For many years he was the editor of &amp; quot ; The Christian Witness &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Church Advocate &amp; quot ; and published many tracts including &amp; quot ; Why I Am a Churchman . &amp; quot ; Randall was consecrated as Missionary Bishop of the Missionary District of Colorado and Parts Adjacent in Trinity Church , Boston , on December 28 , 1865 , by Presiding Bishop John Henry Hopkins , assisted by Bishops Benjamin Smith and Manton Eastburn , among others .
His jurisdiction originally contained the territories of Colorado , Idaho , Montana , and Wyoming .
In 1866 , Montana and Idaho were removed , while New Mexico was added to the district .
Upon arriving in Colorado , he helped establish Calvary Church in Golden . Noting the lack of higher education in the territory , he also helped established the Colorado University Schools which included a school of mines ( which later became the state-run Colorado School of Mines ) , the Jarvis Hall secondary school , and the Matthews Hall school of theology .
George A .
Jarvis , the largest contributor to the territorial activities of Bishop Randall , donated funds for the development of Wolfe Hall , an Episcopal school for girls in Denver .
It was located at Champa and 17th Street .
John D .
Wolfe of New York , the second largest donor and the namesake for Wolfe Hall , which was built by 1871 .
Bishop Randall lived there with his wife . An active Freemason , Randall was raised in Washington Lodge No .
3 in Warren , was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts from 1852-1854 , and was Grand Orator of the Grand Lodge of Colorado in 1872 . Randall died from pneumonia at his residence in Denver in 1873 , leaving behind a wife , Elizabeth Hoar .

The station was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974 .
Atlas Asbestos Mine Superfund SiteThe Atlas Asbestos Mine Superfund Site is located within the Clear Creek Management Area near Fresno County , eighteen miles northwest of Coalinga , California .
The mine started operating in 1963 , covering 435 acres of a large naturally occurring asbestos deposit .
The mine closed in 1979 and was placed in the EPA &amp; apos ; s National Priorities List ( NPL ) in 1983 due to the pollution of asbestos in the surrounding soil , air and water creating potential health hazards for local populations and environment . Asbestos is a defined set of 6 fibrous silicate minerals with physical properties including an inability to dissolve in water and a high resistivity to heat and biological / chemical degradation , making it a valuable product for commercial use .
Its common usage in commercial products prior to the EPA banning its use in 1989 makes it easy for people to be exposed to it in their homes and workplaces . In the United States , the number of deaths by asbestos-related diseases is around ten thousand people per year . The pollution from the Atlas asbestos mine is generated by three open pit asbestos mines , an abandoned mill building , a settling pond and debris .
The contaminants are drained into Los Gatos Creek ( a tributary to the Ponding Basin ) . During floods a detention basin would store the asbestos laden water preventing it from reaching the California Aqueduct ; however , over time the build-up of sediments reduce the storage capacity of the basin allowing asbestos fibers to enter the aqueduct .
It was not until 1980 that the metropolitan water district ( MWD ) of southern California measured elevated levels of asbestos in the water that reached 2500 millions of fibers per liter .
In 2004 , the Department of Water Resources decided to take action and enlarged the detention basin to store more water and prevent further contamination of asbestos fibers in the aqueduct . Asbestos fibers can also be found in air and soils which can endanger the lives of people in the region .
They can be released into the air and soil through two ways , human activity and rock weathering processes .
When the EPA conducted a sampling of airborne asbestos in 1987 in Coalinga they found that there was 1-50 % of Chrystolite asbestos , when they sampled soil they found less than 1 to 98 % of soil in the area was contaminated . The EPA began initial investigations of the site in 1984 in order to determine the best course of action in minimizing harm of human health and protecting the environment . In 1991 , The EPA finished assessing the asbestos contamination in the surface of the mine site .
It was established that they would approach the cleanup process in two OU &amp; apos ; s ( Operating Units ) , which are focused study areas in which specific actions are taken in order to address the different hazards caused by asbestos contamination .
These two OU &amp; apos ; s are the Atlas Asbestos Mine OU and the City of Coalinga OU , which together consist of the cleanup process of the whole Atlas Asbestos Mine Superfund Site . The Atlas Asbestos Mine OU was focused on cleanup of surface asbestos and mining tailings at the site of the mine itself .
Methods of remediation consisted mainly of building diversions to prevent streams from flowing through asbestos contaminated sites and mining tailing , thus minimizing the amount of asbestos eroding and contaminating water sources .
In addition , sediment trapping dams were built and slope stabilizers were implemented on waste piles .
Fences were built to limit access to the area .
The primary cleanup processes and construction involved in remediation occurred between 1994 and 1996 .
Since the primary cleanup process , a re-vegetation pilot study has been conducted in 1999 , and the Five Year Report in 2001 showed signs of erosion in the access road to the site .
Thus a new route was suggested to be explored . Another issue that arose from asbestos contamination was the potential danger of recreational activities occurring in the nearby Clear Creek Management Area ( CCMA ) .
This is a surrounding area of the mine managed by the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) where off-road driving , camping , and hiking were proven to cause higher asbestos levels in the air .
Tests of air samples showed that long term activities caused greater risk of cancer .
The area was immediately closed by the BLM for further discussion of remediation methods . The City of Coalinga OU was focused on remediation of asbestos that had been transported to mills or stored .
The cleanup area consisted of 107 acres of contaminated soil within the city of Coalinga .
Beginning in 1989 , over 200,000 cubic yards of asbestos , nickel and chromium-contaminated soil and building debris were consolidated to be disposed and contained in an underground waste management unit ( WMU ) .
The area of the WMU was capped with an impermeable cover , and is to be continuously monitored along with the groundwater and air .
The area excavated was regraded .
Cleanup of this sector occurred between 1990 and 1993 . The Atlas Asbestos Mine Superfund Site was removed from the National Priorities List ( NPL ) on April 24 , 1998 , based on the fact that responsible parties have taken appropriate action in preventing further environmental damage of the area .
However , as long as hazardous materials remain at the site above levels considered safe by the EPA , reviews must occur every five years . The first five-year report was conducted in 2001 . The second five-year report of the site was completed on September 28 , 2006 .
Due to regulation changes to the levels of asbestos allowed in places of contamination in the soil around the underground waste management unit ( WMU ) , additional remedial action was recommended to assure the safety of the area .
After additional tests conducted by the EPA on water and air samples , results showed that cleanup activities were still protective of human health as well as the environment .
Thus it was established that cleanup has been completed successfully in the Atlas Asbestos Mine site . The next five-year review will be completed by September 2016 .

Authoring Instructional MaterialsAuthoring Instructional Materials ( AIM ) is a management system consisting of a set of commercial and government software used by the United States Navy for the development and design of training curricula and instructional content . First proposed in the 1970s , AIM was designed to maximize the efficiency of the curriculum development process through the use of computer-based automation tools .
Currently , over 300,000 hours of the Navy &amp; apos ; s instructional materials exist utilizing the AIM system . AIM comprises the toolsets AIM I and AIM II , which were developed for the Personal Performance Profile approach and the Task Based approach respectively .
AIM II stores training content on a SQL server , serving as a relational database for managing the relationships between instructional material elements .
PDF , XML and HTML are available as content outputs .
Newer versions of AIM include the Content Planning Module ( CPM ) and Learning Object ( LO ) Module .
The modules incorporate data from the Job Duty Task Analysis ( JDTA ) process , which aids the revision and creation of training programs .
The latest version of the system is AIM 5 . 0 .
The idea of AIM was first proposed in the 1970s , and development of the system began in the 1980s .
In the 1980s , AIM was introduced as an Operational Requirement by the Chief of Naval Education and Training ( CNET ) and initial R &amp; amp ; D was performed by the Navy Personnel Research , Studies , and Technology ( NPRST ) division .
The toolsets AIM I and AIM II were first released between 1987 and 1997 .
An updated version of AIM , integrating the new CPM and LO modules , was developed between 2006 and 2012 .
According to the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division ( NAWCTSD ) , AIM as a system for streamlining curriculum development was able to reduce the &amp; quot ; number of hours spent for development of new training materials by as much as 25 % and for maintenance of existing materials by as much as 50 % . &amp; quot ; The system is currently managed by NAWCTSD , while development and primary support for AIM is provided by the computer software firm Carley Corporation

Bighead spurdogThe bighead spurdog ( &amp; quot ; Squalus bucephalus &amp; quot ; ) is a rare and little-known species of dogfish shark in the family Squalidae .
It is found in deep water south of New Caledonia , and over the Norfolk Ridge .
Reaching at least in length , this stocky shark is brown above and light below , with a broad head and two dorsal fins with long spines .
It is the only member of its genus with both one- and three-pointed dermal denticles .
An infrequent bycatch of longline fisheries , this species is listed under Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . The first specimens of the bighead spurdog were collected during South Pacific biodiversity surveys conducted by the Institut de recherche pour le développement ( IRD ) .
The species was described by Peter Last , Bernard Séret , and John Pogonoski in a 2007 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) publication .
The specific name &amp; quot ; bucephalus &amp; quot ; is derived from the Latin &amp; quot ; bu &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; large &amp; quot ; ) and the Greek &amp; quot ; kephalis &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; of the head &amp; quot ; ) .
Of the four original specimens , a long immature male caught over Norfolk Ridge was selected as the holotype .
Morphologically , this species belongs to a subgroup of &amp; quot ; Squalus &amp; quot ; defined by the shortnose spurdog ( &amp; quot ; S .
megalops &amp; quot ; ) and the Cuban dogfish ( &amp; quot ; S .
cubensis &amp; quot ; ) . The bighead spurdog is a robustly built , spindle-shaped shark with a hump behind the head .
The head is notably broad , and the snout is short and triangular with a blunt tip .
The nostrils are preceded by a forked flap of skin .
The medium-sized eyes are oval in shape and have a notch in the outside corner ; behind them are small , crescent-shaped spiracles .
The mouth is nearly straight and bears long furrows at the corners .
There are 26 – 27 upper and 22 – 24 lower tooth rows .
Each tooth has a single angled , knife-like cusp .
There are five pairs of gill slits , with the first four pairs small and the fifth pair longer . The two dorsal fins bear long spines and have narrowly rounded apexes , concave posterior margins , and short free rear tips .
The first dorsal fin originates above the pectoral fin insertions ; the second is smaller than the first and originates behind the pelvic fins .
The pectoral fins are medium-sized with rounded tips , the pelvic fins are small , and there is no anal fin .
There are lateral keels on the caudal peduncle .
The caudal fin is asymmetrical , with a long upper lobe and a well-developed lower lobe ; the trailing margins of both lobes are convex .
The skin is covered by tiny , non-overlapping dermal denticles .
Unlike other &amp; quot ; Squalus &amp; quot ; species , adults have a mix of one-cusped and three-cusped denticles .
This species is dark brown above , darkening towards the apexes of the dorsal fins , and pale below .
The dorsal fin free rear tips and the caudal fin posterior margin are white .
The largest known specimen measures in length . The bighead spurdog has only been recorded from the waters south of New Caledonia , and from seamounts on the Norfolk Ridge in the northern Tasman Sea .
It has been caught between the depths of . Virtually nothing is known about the natural history of the bighead spurdog .
Male appear to mature sexually at under long . Small numbers of bighead spurdogs are caught incidentally by longliners fishing for ruby snapper ( &amp; quot ; Etelis carbunculus &amp; quot ; ) south of New Caledonia .
The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species .
Claude NealClaude Neal was an African-American farmhand who was lynched on October 26 , 1934 in Jackson County , Florida for allegedly raping and killing Lola Cannady , a nineteen-year-old white female .
He was taken from the county jail in Marianna , and tortured and hanged near the town of Greenwood .
It was a spectacle lynching , committed before a large white crowd drawn from the region .
In the next days , whites rioted in an attempt to drive blacks from the county , injuring an estimated 200 persons , including police .
The governor called in the National Guard to suppress the white rioting .
Neal was arrested , accused of raping and killing Lola Cannady ( sometimes spelled Cannidy ) .
When the news got out , lynch mobs began to form to find and kill him .
In order to keep Neal safe from the lynch mobs , law enforcement moved him to multiple jails , including to Brewton , Alabama .
But a lynch mob found him and brought him back to the county seat of Marianna , Florida .
Neal was tortured and mutilated , and finally killed by a group of lynchers .
They returned the body to the Cannady farm , where it was further mutilated by members of the mob who had come to witness the lynching .
The body was later hanged in front of the Marianna courthouse , before being cut down and buried by the sheriff in the morning .
A large group of people came to the courthouse and demanded that the body be hanged again .
They began attacking blacks in the area and rioting .
The lynching of Claude Neal and the riots that followed played a large part in bringing about the end of the practice of lynching in the United States . Lola Cannady , who lived near Claude Neal , never came back home on Thursday , October 18 , 1934 , after leaving home to walk to a water pump to water the family &amp; apos ; s hogs .
Friends and neighbors helped the Cannady family in their search for Lola in the fields behind the family &amp; apos ; s land .
At 6 : 30 A . M .
the next day , they found her body poorly hidden in the woods , under the cover of two logs and a pine tree branch .
Cannady had been bludgeoned to death with a hammer that had been taken from the Cannady field .
It was later determined that Cannady had been raped . Sheriff Flake Chambliss became focused on two suspects : Claude Neal , a black farmworker , and Calvin Cross , who was white .
Sheriff Chambliss had received reports that Neal had been in the field near the same water pump that Lola had gone to and that he was gone for about two hours before going home .
Neal was arrested about two hours after the discovery of Cannady &amp; apos ; s body . Although the evidence gathered against Neal made him a prime suspect in the case , it was not enough to prove that he was guilty of the crime .
The evidence included bloody clothes that were found at the home he shared with his mother , as well as a bloody piece of fabric which Sheriff Chambliss claimed fit a tear in Neal &amp; apos ; s shirt .
Neal reportedly had cuts on his hands and was inconsistent in his descriptions as to where they had come from ; he gave three different explanations for the cuts , with one being that he had gotten them while fixing a fence , one being that he had cut his hands in a fight , and one being that he had cut them jumping a fence .
In addition , Neal was missing a ring on his pocket watch .
A common , standard watch ring had been found near the spot where Cannady had been murdered .
No tests were done on the murder weapon to determine if Neal &amp; apos ; s fingerprints were on it .
The sheriff moved Neal &amp; apos ; s mother and aunt out of town to prevent them from being harmed by a lynch mob .
But they did not get to testify in front of the coroner &amp; apos ; s jury about allegedly washing Claude Neal &amp; apos ; s bloody clothing , as was claimed by the prosecution . Howard Kester , who was investigating the case and reporting to the NAACP , heard rumors among blacks in the area about the murder of Cannady .
One such rumor was that she had been murdered by a white man who later asked Neal &amp; apos ; s mother and aunt to wash his clothes and possibly offered them payment .
Another rumor was that a white man who lived in Malone , Florida had already confessed to killing Cannady , and that he had given Neal money in exchange for trading clothes with him after he committed the murder .
Neither of these rumors were ever proven .
Kester said that perhaps Neal and Cannady had had a secret love affair , and that he murdered her out of anger if their relationship ended .
He had no evidence for this , and such an affair was denied by the Cannady family . Before the coroner &amp; apos ; s jury had charged Neal and before much evidence had been found , lynch mobs began forming and searching for Neal .
Belief that Neal had killed Cannady spread further when newspapers began running stories about him a day after the crime had occurred .
Due to the lynch mobs trying to find and capture Neal , the sheriff moved him multiple times to different jails : from the Bay County Jail in Panama City , to Camp Walton , then to Pensacola on the morning of October 20 .
In Pensacola , Sheriff Herbert E .
Gandy did not want to keep him in the Escambia County jail because it was not believed to be sturdy enough to withstand an attack , and a group had already recently attempted to raid the jail for Neal .
Neal was moved briefly to Fort Barrancas at the Pensacola Naval Air Station , before finally being moved to the poorly secured jail in Brewton , Alabama In order to keep Neal &amp; apos ; s location a secret , he was booked on charges of vagrancy under the alias of John Smith . On Monday October 22 , after being interrogated by Sheriff Gandy on October 20 and 21 , Neal confessed that he and another black man named Herbert Smith had raped and murdered Lola Cannady .
He had no defense counsel .
He later made another confession and said that he had acted alone . On October 26 a small mob of people arrived in Brewton and while one group distracted the sheriff , others came to the jail where they searched the cells and captured Neal .
This capture of Neal was well planned and carried out , with the abductors using strategy rather than the common lynch mob approach of intimidating the police force .
The group traveled back to Jackson County with Neal .
They reassured each other about their actions , saying that Neal did not deserve a trial because of the heinous nature of his crimes .
The group told the newspapers that they intended to lynch Neal ; they believed their decision was justified .
The abductors announced that he would be lynched that night between the hours of 8 o &amp; apos ; clock P . M .
and 9 o &amp; apos ; clock P . M . .
The media openly reported in newspapers and on radios that Neal was going to be lynched . A large group formed to witness the Claude Neal lynching on the Cannady family &amp; apos ; s land ; estimates of the crowds size ranged from hundreds to several thousand .
The leaders in the group of spectators attempted to calm the group so that they could bring Claude Neal to the property for the lynching but became apprehensive as the group became further impatient and unruly .
The leaders who had promised the Cannady family that they could be the first to attack Neal attempted to sneak the family away from the crowd of spectators to the place where Lola Cannady had been murdered , so that George Cannady could be the one to kill Neal .
The crowd was informed of the Cannady family moving and quickly caught up but when Neal was still not brought out , the group grew further frustrated .
It was determined by the committee of six in charge of Neal &amp; apos ; s lynching that a riot could break out if Neal was brought in front of the crowd and that he would have to be killed in private by those holding him .
The men holding Neal brought him to a spot in the woods near Peri Landing along the Chattahoochee River to lynch him . Claude Neal was tortured and subjected to castration , forced autocannibalism of his genitalia , stabbing , burning with hot irons , the removal of his toes and fingers , and hanging before the group killed him .
They tied his corpse to an automobile and drove to the Cannady property at 1 o &amp; apos ; clock A . M .
After the body was delivered , George Cannady was upset that he had not been the one to kill Neal , and shot the body three times in the forehead .
The crowd further mutilated the body by kicking it , stabbing it and running over it with cars .
Some children in the crowd participated by stabbing the body with sharpened sticks .
Out of anger towards Neal and black people in general , the crowd burned shacks in the area that were owned by blacks . The body of Claude Neal was hanged outside of the town courthouse at 3 o &amp; apos ; clock A . M .
but was discovered by Sheriff Chambliss at 6 o &amp; apos ; clock A . M .
He cut it down and buried it .
A mob formed outside of the courthouse with over two thousand people having arrived by noon , but they were too late to see Neal &amp; apos ; s body .
Some purchased picture postcards of the corpse from photographers for fifty cents each .
The mob demanded that the sheriff hang Neal &amp; apos ; s body again outside the courthouse but he refused . The whites started to riot .
They attacked blacks that day , October 27 , 1934 , injuring about 200 blacks ; the mob also attacked some police trying to suppress the disorder .
Some white people took great risks by protecting black people during the riots , often aiding people who they worked with .
The governor of Florida called out the National Guard , which managed to suppress the riots . The brutal lynching of Claude Neal generated outrage in the rest of the country .
Even in Florida , there was reaction and lynching lost its previous social acceptance .
Neal &amp; apos ; s lynching provoked strong opposition to the practice across the nation .
The media gave extensive national coverage to the events .
By this time , Southern women had organized to oppose lynchings and were regularly speaking out about it .
The lynching also showed people how ineffective the policies and measures were on both the local and federal levels for preventing lynchings in the United States .
Many Americans became determined to bring an end to such practices throughout the country .
Carla ChapmanCarla L .
Chapman Sibley ( born Carla Chapman ) is recognized as one of the top basketball players in the state of Ohio .
She made a name for herself in high school , on the girls basketball team at St .
Vincent-St .
Mary &amp; apos ; s , preceding fellow St .
Vincent alumni , like Jerome Lane and LeBron James .
Her star continued to shine at Ohio State University , playing for the Lady Buckeyes . During her four years at St .
Vincent-St .
Mary her junior and senior years were the most memorable as she led her team to two Ohio High School Athletic Association ( OHSAA ) , AAA state championships .
During her last season she averaged 25 points / game and 20 rebounds , earning her a fourth team spot on Parade Magazine &amp; apos ; s All-America list .
This was a perfect segue to her collegiate basketball career with the Ohio State Lady Buckeyes . Carla played four years of varsity basketball with the Lady Buckeyes , establishing herself as a dominant player under Coach Tara Van Derveer , while helping the Lady Buckeyes capture four Big 10 Championships from 1982 through &amp; apos ; 85 .
During her years in the Buckeyes lineup , OSU compiled seasons of 20-7 , 23-5 , 22-7 and 28-3 , respectively .
In 1985 Lady Buckeyes reached the NCAA East Regional final before being eliminated .
Her career total of 1,247 points and 633 rebounds in 99 games was outstanding .
She earned first team All-Big Ten honors with a scoring average of 15 . 3 points / game in 1984 and 7 . 2 rebounds / game in 1983 . Years after her days as a player were over Carla left such an impression on people of Summit County that she was voted one of the Sports Figures of the Century by Akron Beacon Journal sports fans in 1999 .
A year later she was inducted into the Summit County Sports Hall of Fame , as well as St .
Vincent-St .
Mary &amp; apos ; s Sports Hall of Fame . After receiving her B . A .
from Ohio State in 1985 Carla returned to the Akron area where she has continued to make a name for herself as a community liaison and director of special programs for the Akron Public School District .
Upon completing her M . A .
at Akron U in 1994 she began working for the school district in a number of capacities , including coach of the Garfield High School Girls Basketball team from 1998-2001 .
In spite of the fact that she had taken them from losing seasons to winning seasons , she resigned from that position to focus on the health issues of her daughter Raina .
Two years later she returned to Garfield as the only female coach of a boys basketball team in the state of Ohio .
She held that position from 2003-2004 before retiring from the sports world all together .
Although , she is not actively involved in sports at this time , Carla is still remembered as one of the &amp; quot ; Best of the Best of Summit County , &amp; quot ; as evidenced by her inclusion in 2006 on a list of the 50 greatest athletes from Summit County .
She graces this list , right alongside sports immortals Fritz Pollard , Larry Csonka , Nate Thurmond and Gus Johnson .
Notably missing from this list is LeBron James .
Apparently , he &amp; apos ; s too young to make the list , yet . Carla has been just as successful off the court as she was on the court .
From 1994 to the present she &amp; apos ; s been employed by the Akron Public School Board .
She began her work in the schools as the Enterprise Community Family Services Liaison for several inner-city schools in low-income neighborhoods coordinating student and family support services , including after-school programs , health services , academic interventions and case management .
Not long after taking this position she also began coaching the Garfield Girls Basketball team , which might seem an odd combination to many , but for Carla it was a natural , for as she found every student athlete had a backstory full of all kinds of challenges that had to be dealt with before they ever got on the court and long after they left the court .
Carla dealt with these problems as she coached the girls and the boys alike .
The only thing that distracted her being the care of her own children Raina and Jeff , Jr . In 1997 she became a social services specialist for the district and began coordinating several local , state and federal grant projects serving students in grades K-12 , bringing many organizations together in creative partnerships with APS .
In 2003-2009 she acted as a Special Projects Coordinator for the district , during which time she instituted a new program called Perkins Activities Central , which received high accolades in Northeast Ohio as a best practices program .
WKYC-TV featured the program in their 2006 documentary , “ Making the Grade : Helping our Kids Achieve . ” It &amp; apos ; s this kind of thinking that continues to keep the spotlight shining on Carla , who continues to receive accolades from her peers and colleagues . Carla continues to reside in Akron , Ohio with her husband Jeff Sibley and their two children Raina and Jeff , Jr .

Luther Burbank Rose Parade and FestivalThe Luther Burbank Rose Parade and Festival is an annual festival held in Santa Rosa , California celebrating Luther Burbank and his contribution to the world through a series of events .
This festival has undergone changes throughout the years but has always included activities for all ages , and is now held on the third Saturday of May .
In 1994 the parade became a tax-exempt corporation , no longer being run by other civic organizations .
It has an annual budget of around $ 100,000 . 00 to produce the parade and festival .
This is achieved through grants , donations and entrance / vendor fees .
The parade is now centered on a theme that changes each year , allowing for the incorporation of new activities , displays and floats . The Rose Parade began in 1894 , then called the Rose Carnival , with the help of Thomas Patrick Keegan and began a rich tradition of celebrating the beautiful landscape of Sonoma County .
Keegan was a city engineer and clothier in Santa Rosa .
He “ conceived the moving exhibit of community pride and creativity ” so many years ago .
Brian Keegan , a descendant of Thomas Patrick Keegan , was President of the Rose Parade and Festival board a few years ago .
He sought to continue the legacy of his ancestor in bringing civic pride to the community .
Brian Keegan still currently serves on the board . In the early 1900s the parade and festival was organized by the collaboration of the Chamber of Commerce and other civic organizations .
In typical parade fashion , the participants included various groups atop ornately ordained floats , automobiles , marching bands and note-worthy community members .
The floats in the procession included various species of flowers , not just roses .
Unlike in present day , the event was not seen as a casual affair .
Patrons and spectators alike dressed lavishly to attend the parade and festival .
The parade and festival was seen as an event of the season in which people came from all around to engage in the rich display of natural beauty of Sonoma County . The parade was always preceded by a gala , the Coronation Ball , in which a queen and royal court were selected to reign over the events of the weekend .
This affair included a lavish orchestra , accompanied by much dancing .
The “ royal robes ” were designed by a well-known clothier in San Francisco .
A throne was erected in a pavilion in which the royal court sat to oversee the festivities .
This pergola kept true to the flower theme by having “ heavy pillars supporting the canopy of trailing vines and intermingling roses . ” The parade did not take place for the years spanning the World Wars .
It began anew in the 1950s when the Junior Chamber of Commerce undertook the task of organizing it once again .
It is then that the parade was renamed in honor of Luther Burbank .
After the long reprieve in the 1930s and 1940s , the organizers of the celebration took to inviting well-known figures to participate in the parade as Grand Marshals .
One such person was Charles Schulz , giving a Peanuts flavor to the parade and carnival on that year .
Others include government officials , local heroes , veterans and business owners .
These prominent individuals served to help promote the parade and festival in sphere &amp; apos ; s outside the Santa Rosa locale . In 1910 part of the festivities included a dedication of the new court house in Santa Rosa , overseen by the Queen of the Rose Parade .
In later years , events would include sports competitions , fireworks , bicycle races and carnival games .
Events began to stretch across the city , with golf tournaments , sailing contests , children &amp; apos ; s entertainment and dance competitions .
On the 100th anniversary of the parade , a more fair-like atmosphere was introduced to the agenda .
This included carnival games and other fun activities in which children could participate .
More recently , cooking competitions and other theme-based activities have been worked into the agenda . Throughout the twentieth century , floats were designed to reflect popular culture at the time .
Floats featuring baseball , women &amp; apos ; s solidarity , peace , pioneering , etc . , were all present to promote the issues and interests of the times .
Events often included foot and auto races , baby contests , and the like .
1909 marked an unprecedented project for the parade : a nighttime affair with lighted floats .
It was an impressive undertaking in which “ floats med lavish use of lighted designs and the parade included one float lighted by means of an electric trolley attached to the car line . ” In light of the turbulent political times of the 1960s , a less jovial air was involved in the displays .
In 1967 Ray Smith of The Press Democrat wrote , “ Missing from this parade was laughter .
There were no firemen in red pajamas squirting water , or clowns … In brief : there was no comedy in the units entered in the comical feature and miscellaneous category . ” This was not the typical aura of the affair – most years are met with celebration and excitement from all involved . In recent years , the parade has claimed close to a quarter million people in attendance per year .
It often includes close to 4,000 volunteers .
There is now a more regimented protocol for entrance into the parade , including a rule that states at least one rose must be seen by the judges or a point penalty will be incurred These rules are established in order to maintain safety and create a level evaluation platform for all entries .
There are several categories in which to enter , with awards including : best entry using local history , best use of recycled material , best use of roses , best use of theme and several placement awards for various categories .
The Rose Parade and Festival offers over $ 4,000 worth of awards to winners .
The clowns in the parade are local business owners and community members that have made significant contributions to the organization .
They call themselves the “ Distinguished Clown Corps . ” These individuals are trained by a professional clown in order to properly entertain the crowds .
The dedication of community leaders to the Rose Parade and Festival serves to show the importance of the event to civic pride . Currently the parade route centers on the Luther Burbank Home and Gardens , winds down 4th Street and Mendocino Avenue to end near 1st Street .
The festival takes place at Juilliard Park after the parade and includes much music , games , food and frivolity .
It is also in this place that the award ceremony commences .
In light of the recent economic decline , the festival has downsized from a three-day affair to that of only one .

Religion in Israeli SchoolsThe State of Israel recognizes all religious schools , at every level , whether they are publicly funded or privatized .
The state has taken on a &amp; quot ; melting pot &amp; quot ; mentality to education , meaning they back all religious schools and teachings of religions as long as they follow the mandated structure set by the Ministry of education .
Religion plays a large role in the education of all students in Israel . Israeli state schools all share a ministry of education , however Arab and Jewish schools are largely segregated with most Arab students going to Arab schools and most Jewish students going to Jewish schools .
Similarly , Arab schools have primarily Arab teachers who teach Hebrew only as a second language .
The divide in Israeli schools based on ethnic identification leads to a divide on religious studies taught in schools , with the state backing both methods of teaching .
In Israeli Jewish schools , Judaism is seen as a part of the heritage and culture of Israel and so the teaching of Jewish holidays and religious practices is seen as crucial to the understanding of the state .
The Torah and other Jewish practices are studied in a critical manner to understand the identity of a majority of the Israeli population .
In 2007 the &amp; quot ; Public Committee for Bible Education &amp; quot ; was established to further encourage the teachings of the bible in order to close the growing gap between the secular and religious members of society . Another way that religion plays a large role in education in Israel is the way it impacts the Arab population in the state .
In 2001 , 82 % of the Arab population was made up of Muslim , a number that is only growing .
As of now the majority of this Israeli population lives on the outskirt of the main cites , mostly in the northern villages that only hold 10 % of the Jewish population .
Lack of financial means , through less industrial development in these villages and declines in agriculture , have decreased the opportunities for Muslim Arabs to move to more populated areas in Israel .
Lack of migration has impaired the ability for young Arabs to attend better ranked schools and limited financial means has put more pressure on students to be employed at a younger age .
The circumstances placed on lately Muslim students has created a lower level of success for members of the religion in Israel . The uneven distribution of advantages and disadvantages for students in Israel has been a source of controversy in the recent years .
While Israeli schools back all religious programs , and the Ministry of Education has a set of guidelines , the vast differences in schools has created major differences in schools across the state .
Schools vary in size , funding , teacher qualities , and class structures , so that educations between schools are hard to compare and even harder to evaluate .
This becomes more complicated when trying to compare students from schools that teach different religious historical backgrounds ( i . e .
Arab schools and Jewish schools . ) Furthermore , a recent study found that the rising budget cuts to state secular and state religious schools drove up the number of students who attended private institutions for religious or academic studies , and critics argue that this creates a bigger divide among the wealthier and lower classes , primarily the Muslim and Jewish populations .
Critics argue that a bigger wedge between varying religions cause further divide among the different ethnicities within the state , causing long term tension .

Ann FoxSister Ann Fox ( born Jeralee Ann Fox in 1933 ) is a Roman Catholic sister , social activist and expert in educational enrichment .
She is co-founder and previous executive director of the Paraclete Foundation .
She teamed with Barry T .
Hynes to create the Paraclete Foundation to provide educational enrichment for at-risk children in South Boston .
The Paraclete Foundation , along with South Boston mothers known as the Stella Maris Group created the Paraclete Academy in 1997 .
The academy is housed in the former St .
Augustine ’ s convent .
The Paraclete Academy focuses on elementary and early middle school aged , at-risk children .
The Paraclete Academy provides after school enrichment programs in the South Boston community that aims to erase the education disparity between inner city children and their more affluent peers .
By Sister Ann ’ s retirement as executive director in 2012 , nearly 1,000 local children had participated in the Paraclete Academy ’ s programs and over 70 young college graduates had volunteered as full-time teachers in residence . Sister Ann was born in Jackson , Michigan in 1933 and grew up in rural Scio Township outside of Ann Arbor where she attended public schools .
After graduation from the University of Michigan , where she had converted to Catholicism , she moved to New York City in 1953 which at the time was a center of Catholic intellectual life and social activism .
Her interest in social activism sprouted early .
She studied Social Work at Fordham University . In 1961 she entered Sisters of Charity .
The order focused on serving the poor , offering Sister Ann the perfect opportunity to combine her two great passions : Catholicism and social activism .
Sister Ann &amp; apos ; s time as a Sister of Charity ended in 1970 .
At the time she was in Boston heading a social work clinic in the now closed Nazareth Home for Children which was a mission of the Daughters of Charity .
Sister Ann was supportive of the Second Vatican Council ’ s call for renewal of religious life and saw it as a “ freeing opportunity for the sisters to live and work more closely with the communities they served .
Sister Ann decided to take advantage of an ancient rite of the early Church for consecration of virgins that was restored by Vatican II , and in 1974 was consecrated by Humberto Cardinal Mediros of Boston and sent for with his blessings to become a sister living in the world , supporting herself , and ministering in the community . Her first community was the Bromley- Heath housing development where she lived in one of the apartments .
At the development , she began at the request of the women there , one of the first training and education programs for welfare mothers .
In 1988 she was asked to become Executive Director of the South Boston Neighborhood House It was here that she established a reputation for her dedication and commitment to the South Boston community .
During her eight-year tenure there , working with the Chair of the Board of Directors , Frank McCourt , she oversaw the construction of its present building , which included an old-fashioned barn raising bringing many unions in for the day to put up the two-story building . While attending the first gathering of Women Waging Peace , Sister Ann met Aloisea Inyumba , who was then governor of one of the poorest areas in Rwanda , Kigali-Ngali province , whose Tutsi population was decimated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide .
As a poor refugee growing up in Uganda who had the opportunity to attend an excellent girls ’ school , Governor Inyumba knew the impact that the education of girls can make on the development of a nation .
She asked Sr .
Ann ’ s help to build a leadership school in Rwanda that poor girls could attend . In 2002 Sister Ann met Hon .
Inyumba in Rwanda to plan their strategy for launching the school .
Governor Inyumba secured land in Nyamata while Sister Ann secured architects .
They were able to secure the Benebikira Sisters of Rwanda as a partner to help set up and administer the school .
Fundraising efforts were linked to taking groups of Americans interested in international development to Rwanda .
In 2006 the Maranyundo Initiative was created by a group of Boston women who made such a trip ; they took on responsibility to finish fundraising for the school ’ s construction and now continue to support the school .
Ownership was turned over to the Benebikira sisters in 2010 . The Maranyundo School opened in February 2008 with an initial class of 60 girls .
In just three years it established a reputation for excellence .
The first graduating class ranked # 1 in girls schools and third overall in the national “ O ” level exams .
Its second graduating class ranked 2nd , and its 3rd graduating class ( 2012 ) ranked # 1 in the country . Through her work in Rwanda , Sister Ann is closely associated with the Benebikira Sisters , a native Rwandan congregation that focuses on the poor , especially women and children in Rwanda , Burundi , Uganda and Kenya .
She has helped them developed partnerships with Babson College and Lesley University for education exchange .

Société du Havre de MontréalSociété du Havre de Montréal ( SHM ) was a publicly funded , non-profit business in Montreal , Quebec , Canada .
It was created in 2002 to oversee the redevelopment of Montreal &amp; apos ; s harbourfront via the reconstruction of the Bonaventure Expressway .
In January 2013 , the city of Montreal announced that it would take over the SHM &amp; apos ; s responsibilities , and it was wound down by the end of April . The SHM was established in 2002 to design a plan for the redevelopment of Montreal &amp; apos ; s harbourfront .
The organization initially received funding from the municipal , Quebec provincial , and Canadian federal governments .
In 2007 , it presented a final report entitled &amp; quot ; Vision 2025 &amp; quot ; ; the provincial and federal governments withdrew their funding shortly thereafter . The SHM was criticized by opposition municipal parties , which accused it of financial mismanagement , unaccountability , and having a conflict-of-interest situation in its leadership .
City councillor Véronique Fournier said in 2013 , &amp; quot ; We always believed the SHM was a recipe for disaster .
Because it &amp; apos ; s a private corporation , it isn &amp; apos ; t bound to the same kind of access to information laws as the city .
So while I &amp; apos ; m not saying there was ever anything criminal happening at the SHM , the ingredients were definitely there . &amp; quot ; Montreal &amp; apos ; s auditor-general , Jacques Bergeron , indicated that it was almost impossible to ascertain the real costs of the SHM &amp; apos ; s studies and consultations in the absence of a reliable paper trail . Montreal mayor Michael Applebaum announced on January 24 , 2013 that the city of Montreal would take over responsibility for the Bonaventure Expressway from the SHM , citing the need for transparency .
The SHM would then be dismantled by April 30 .

Although outside groups participated extensively in support of either candidate in the election , the flood of money that had been expected to be spent on behalf of Gomez did not materialize .
Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas , the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , indicated that Gomez would run again for the seat in the November 2014 regular election , in an attempt to win a full six-year term .
Gomez later decided not to seek elected office during the 2014 election cycle , but has stated he may return to politics in the future .

Robert BernerRobert Arbuckle Berner ( November 25 , 1935 – January 10 , 2015 ) was an American scientist known for his contributions to the modeling of the carbon cycle .
He taught Geology and Geophysics from 1965 to 2007 at Yale University , where he latterly served as Professor Emeritus until his death .
His work on sedimentary rocks led to the co-founding of the BLAG model of atmospheric carbon dioxide , which takes into account both geochemical and biological contributions to the carbon cycle . Berner was born on November 25 , 1935 in Erie , Pennsylvania to Paul Nau Berner and Priscilla ( Arbuckle ) Berner .
He was encouraged to develop an interest in geology by his older brother ( and now retired geologist ) Paul .
Bob initially attended Purdue University but soon transferred to the University of Michigan , where he earned his bachelor &amp; apos ; s degree in 1958 and his master &amp; apos ; s degree in 1959 .
Next he attended Harvard University where in 1962 he earned his Ph . D .
in Geology . In 1962 , Berner won a fellowship to do research at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego , California .
From 1963 until 1965 , he worked as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago .
Beginning in 1965 , he taught at Yale University where he became the Alan M .
Bateman Professor in 1987 , a position he held until his retirement in 2007 . Berner &amp; apos ; s early research focused on the application of chemical thermodynamics and kinetics on sediments and sedimentary rocks .
Results from these experiments led to his 1971 book &amp; quot ; Principles of Chemical Sedimentology . &amp; quot ; In 1980 , Berner authored &amp; quot ; Early Diagenesis : A Theoretical Approach &amp; quot ; which was quoted so often that the Institute for Scientific Information declared it a Science Citation Classic .
Noting the role that sedimentary rocks at or near the Earth &amp; apos ; s surface play in the carbon cycle , Berner , along with Tony Lasaga , and Bob Garrels put forth the BLAG model of the carbon cycle in 1983 ( BLAG from the letters of their last names ) .
BLAG attempts to model variations of atmospheric carbon dioxide back through geologic time to the Cretaceous using both Geochemical and Biological carbon cycles .

For much of that time , his program , &amp; quot ; The Art of Jazz , &amp; quot ; aired on FM radio stations in New Jersey and was heard throughout the New York metropolitan area .
Vincent was known for his smooth , resonant voice and encyclopedic knowledge of jazz .
He championed jazz as a unique American art form on a par with western classical music . A popular part of Vincent &amp; apos ; s radio broadcasts were his interviews with jazz greats , including Louis Armstrong , Count Basie , Dave Brubeck , Ray Charles , Roy Eldridge , Duke Ellington , Tal Farlow , Art Farmer , Dizzie Gillespie , Jimmy Hamilton , Woody Herman , Richard &amp; quot ; Groove &amp; quot ; Holmes , Kenyon Hopkins , Stan Kenton , Gerry Mulligan , Peter Nero , Anita O &amp; apos ; Day , Houston Person , Arthur Prysock , Lou Rawls , Don Sebesky , Jimmy Smith , Maxine Sullivan , Dr .

Vincent became the station &amp; apos ; s chief engineer .
Around 1960 , Vincent hosted his first broadcast on WFHA , a short-lived country music show .
In 1961 he debuted his show , &amp; quot ; The Art of Jazz . &amp; quot ; Vincent broadcast a wide range of jazz recordings , from obscure to popular , including all genres , such as blues , Dixieland , manouche , bebop , contemporary , avant garde , etc .
His shows often included contests and topical call-in segments .
Jazz musicians were frequent in-studio guests , and Vincent would often play interviews he had recorded on-location .
Through this rich and varied format , he strove to give his audience a quality listening experience . Vincent was a maverick , refusing to follow some of the commercial broadcasting conventions of his day .
He wouldn &amp; apos ; t speak over the beginning or end of a track , as was the norm for most DJs of the time .
He would play several tracks in sequence , talk-free and without commercials .
He declined to use management-endorsed playlists , instead developing unique playlists for each broadcast , based on his personal taste and feedback from listeners and musicians . In 1967 Vincent moved his show to WJLK and then to WRLB in 1969 .
He was popular in the NY area jazz community , and developed close relationships with fans and musicians alike .
In 1972 , he was a guest on the WOR television program , &amp; quot ; The Joe Franklin Show , &amp; quot ; along with flutist Bobbi Humphrey .
Vincent also appeared on the Franklin show in the late 1960s or early 1970s , with his longtime friend , guitarist Tal Farlow .
Additionally , Farlow composed theme music for the &amp; quot ; Art of Jazz , &amp; quot ; writing two iterations of the theme : &amp; quot ; Blue Art &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Blue Art , Too . &amp; quot ; Farlow released the latter version on LP in 1981 , much to the delight of Vincent and his fans . Throughout his career , Vincent served as master of ceremonies for jazz concerts in New Jersey and elsewhere .
In 1972 , he was instrumental in starting what became a long-running jazz performance series at the Monmouth County Library in New Jersey .
Vincent proposed the idea , and worked with library management to plan the first jazz concerts held in a U . S .
public library reading room .
He served as MC for the initial three years of the series .
Vincent also produced dozens of jazz concerts , at various venues , featuring performers such as Ruth Brown , Tal Farlow , Jimmy Heath , Etta Jones , Hank Jones , Wynton Marsalis , Ray Nance , Zoot Simms , Grady Tate , Teddy Wilson and other top players .
( Vincent can be heard as MC on the final track of guitarist Eddie Hazell &amp; apos ; s 1976 album &amp; quot ; Take Your Shoes Off , Baby . &amp; quot ; ) In the mid 1970s , with friends and colleagues , he started the AOJ &amp; amp ; Company , a non-profit organization devoted to the promotion of jazz through live concerts , lectures and member networking . In 1979 the &amp; quot ; Art of Jazz &amp; quot ; show moved to NPR affiliate WBGO .
That same year , Vincent was heard on NPR hosting the EBU &amp; apos ; s French Jazz Festival ( and again in 1981 ) .
In 1980 , Vincent co-hosted the &amp; quot ; Kool Jazz Festival &amp; quot ; on NPR , live from Gracie Mansion in New York City .
For the 1980-81 Golden Apple Awards , NYC Jazz Magazine readers nominated Vincent as the best DJ in the local jazz community .
Vincent left WBGO in 1981 , but continued to be active in the New York area jazz scene .
In the mid-1980s he was heard on WBJB . In the late 1980s , Vincent recorded a series of jazz musician interviews for Florida-based &amp; quot ; Backstage America , &amp; quot ; a nationally syndicated program of arts-related news and commentary .
Vincent &amp; apos ; s 15 minute &amp; quot ; Jazzcast &amp; quot ; segments were heard on radio stations in 17 states .
He interviewed over 75 musicians for this series , including Toshiko Akiyoshi , Betty Carter , Buck Clayton , Panama Francis , Chico Hamilton , Milt Hinton , Clifford Jordan , Branford Marsalis , David &amp; quot ; Fathead &amp; quot ; Newman , and Sun Ra , to name a few . Vincent &amp; apos ; s radio show received a mention in Batt Johnson &amp; apos ; s book , &amp; quot ; What is This Thing Called Jazz ? &amp; quot ; ( iUniverse , 2000 ) .
Part of Vincent &amp; apos ; s 1973 interview with bassist Gene Ramey is quoted in Richard Lawn &amp; apos ; s textbook , &amp; quot ; Experiencing Jazz &amp; quot ; ( McGraw-Hill , 2006 ; Routledge , 2nd ed .

John Dewey Academy of LearningThe John Dewey Academy of Learning ( JDAL ) is a charter school of the Green Bay Area Public School District .
It is the Green Bay Area Public School District &amp; apos ; s first and only charter school .
The school &amp; apos ; s street address is 1420 Harvey Street , Green Bay , WI 54302 . John Dewey was formed by contract with the Green Bay Area Public School District .
It operates on a five-year contractual term , the maximum allowed by Wisconsin state law .
The next school year in which the contract will be again up for discussion is 2020-21 . Unlike most schools , JDAL ( John Dewey Academy of Learning ) operates largely without a principal , relying mainly on the lead adviser Jen Agamaite ( who is also the Green Bay Area Public School &amp; apos ; s Director of Charter Schools ) and a parent and community Governance Council for leadership . JDAL utilizes Project Based Learning , ALEKS ( for mathematics ) , Achieve3000 ( for Language Arts ) , and a series of seminars taught by community members , parents , students , and staff .
JDAL differs in operation from what is commonly found in high schools within the United States , instead employing a classroom approach similar to an elementary or primary school , in which students remain in a single room for the majority of the school day .
As of July , 2018 there are four of such classrooms , colloquially referred to as &amp; apos ; advisories &amp; apos ; .
Within each advisory , a staff member familiar with a subject , or a series of subjects is found .
Students are assigned to the advisories with some degree of randomness , and generally remain within the same advisory until there senior year , at which point they move to an advisory dedicated entirely to seniors . As a conjunctive to projects , students often sign up for Seminars , a limited term engagement varying from a few weeks to an entire semester , these credit bearing classes offer students a wide variety of choices .
Previously existing seminars are Practical Psychology , Abnormal Psychology , Crime Scene Investigations , Branding and Marketing , Genocide , Human Sexuality and Development , among others .
These courses are taught by existing staff , students , parents , and community members , under the supervision of one or more advisers . By Senior Year , students often have few credits left to earn before meeting the Board of Education &amp; apos ; s requirements for graduation .
As such , seniors spend most of there time conducting a Capstone project which exists as a culmination of there learning , and typically involves over 500 hours of work .
Capstone projects often have major effects on the school as a whole , and often impact the community in general .

Some major campaigns are recurring , while others have since ended .
Beginning in 2013 and ending in 2016 , a now graduated student led a school partnership with Dosomthing . org through which they collected jeans for homeless teens at various collection points throughout the city of Green Bay , including at the school , at the Downtown YWCA in Green Bay , and at the Kavarna Coffee House .
In the three years the program operated , the school collected around 500 pairs of jeans .
In 2016 , the program was ended due to a loss of support from the sponsoring organization ( Dosomthing . org ) From 2012 until 2016 , JDAL partnered with the Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary in a yearly school wide competition to aide in the removal and destruction of the invasive Garlic Mustard .
Beginning in 2013-14 school year , students took collected garlic mustard and made and served a meal to homeless citizens of Green Bay at the NEW Homeless Shelter in a program called From Pest to Pesto .
In 2016 , due to administrative changes at the shelter , the event became a community dinner .
In the 2016-17 school year , the event was canceled due to repeating inclement weather , and the event has not occurred since .
JDAL hosts a bi-yearly &amp; quot ; Event Night &amp; quot ; where students show one of there favorite projects from that year to the community in a Science Fair Style Event .
Green Bay Mayor Jim Schmitt regularly attends these events , in addition to members of the Board of Education for the City of Green Bay .
Mirza Muhammad IsmailMirza Muhammad Ismail Qandahari ( c 1813-1912 ) , usually known as Mirza Muhammad Ismail , was an Afghan religious scholar and the first convert to the Ahmadiyya faith among the Pashtons of the North West Frontier Province of India . He was an ethnic Turk , born about 1813 at Qandahar , Afghanistan .
His father was a Qazi in the city of Qandahar , as well as being a some-time minister during the reign of Shah Shujah Durrani ( 1785-1842 ) , King of Afghanistan .
He was a scholar of Arabic , Persian and Pashto , a good poet and a calligrapher . He was a Pashto and Persian teacher to Captain ( later Major ) Henry George Raverty ( 1825-1906 ) , assisting him in many of his works on the Pashto language .
He converted to Ahmadiyya Islam in response to a vision in 1887 . Ismail died on September 18 , 1912 , at Peshawar . Ismail was born in the house of a renowned religious scholar , a Qazi , in the city of Qandahar . Raised speaking Pashto , he became a scholar of Arabic , Persian and his native language , as well as being an Islamic jurist who was able to assist his father in his profession as a Qazi .
According to his biographer , Qazi Muhammad Yousaf , he never marriedHe had an interest in Pashto and Persian poetry , writing his own poetry .
Henry George Raverty mentioned his skill as both a poet and scholarAt the age of 32 , Ismail left Afghanistan and traveled to India .
Leaving Qandahar , he passed through Chaman , Pashin , Quetta , Sibi , Shikarpur and Sind .
He stayed in these places and continued his intellectual pursuits .
Qazi Muhammad Yousaf has recorded his discussion of Shia and Sunni differences with a scholar at Shikarpur .
He ended his journey in Bombay , where he was appointed tutor in Pashto and Persian to Captain Henry George Raverty of the 3rd Bombay Native Infantry , accompanying him on military campaigns , and ending up in Peshawar in 1852 . Henry George Raverty makes clear reference to Ismail &amp; apos ; s contribution to his various works .
In the introduction to Raverty &amp; apos ; s &amp; apos ; Dictionary of the Pashto Language &amp; apos ; he writes : A similar comment about Ismail is found in Raverty &amp; apos ; s &amp; apos ; Preface &amp; apos ; to the &amp; quot ; Grammar of the Afghan language , Pakhtu &amp; quot ; . In 1852 , Mirza Muhammad Ismail was appointed District Inspector of Schools in the Peshawar and Hazara districts to look after the newly established schooling system in this region .
He served in this position until his retirement in 1884 .
He travelled widely in the region to inspect schools in the villages of the North West Frontier . Molvi Muhammad Ismail made a contribution to Pashto literature and to the learning of Pashto as a foreign language , publishing handbooks such as &amp; quot ; Pashto Tutor &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Khazana-i-Afghani &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Sawal-o-Jawa &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Pushto Guide &amp; quot ; .
Tariq Rahman writes : While in Peshawar , Ismail was requested by T . P .
Hughes and Worthington Jukes to translate parts of the Bible into Pashto .
This translation work assisted his understanding the works of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and his claims . In 1887 , he had a vision , which he reported to Qazi Muhammad Yousaf . Ismail would always say he had taken his Bay &amp; apos ; ah in that Vision in 1887 .
Yousaf named him as the first Ahmadi among the Pashtoons of the North West Frontier . He was a subscriber to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad &amp; apos ; s Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya . When the Founder of the Ahmadiyya Community published his claim to be the promised Messiah in his books &amp; quot ; Fatah Islam &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Tauzi Muram &amp; quot ; in 1891 , Ismail commented that &amp; quot ; The writer speaks like the Messengers of Bani Israel &amp; quot ; ; his Bible translation work had made him acquainted with the Biblical prophets . He became a spiritual disciple of the Syed Amir of &amp; quot ; Kotah &amp; quot ; ( Swabi ) , and claimed to have had a vision of the Syed in which he had &amp; apos ; seen &amp; apos ; the ushering in of the era of the Mahdi of the End time . In &amp; quot ; Tohfa e Golariya &amp; quot ; , Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote : Muhammad Ismail lived in Peshawar from 1852 to 1912 , dying on September 18 , 1912 .

Dryas integrifoliaDryas integrifolia is a species of flowering plant in the rose family known by the common names entireleaf mountain-avens , white mountain-avens , northern white mountain avens , and mountain avens .
It is native to northern parts of North America , where it occurs from Alaska across Canada to Greenland .
It is a common species of the Arctic and it is probably the most common flowering plant on some of the western Arctic islands . This plant is a shrub , often a dwarf shrub .
It forms a prostrate mat up to 10 to 17 centimeters tall , the stems branching horizontally along the ground .
The leaves are borne on petioles that are covered in long , silky or woolly hairs .
The leaf blades are linear to lance-shaped and measure up to 2 . 2 centimeters long .
The blades have smooth upper surfaces and densely hairy undersides .
The flowering stem has no leaves on it but is covered in long woolly hairs .
It bears a single flower with up to 11 petals which are usually white but may be shades of yellow or cream .
In the middle are many stamens tipped with yellow anthers .
The styles start small and enlarge as the attached fruits mature , becoming up to 2 . 5 centimeters long and sporting a plumelike coat of long , fluffy hairs .
These plumes tangle together , and clumps of fruits fall away from the plant to be borne away on the wind . Some flowers exhibit heliotropism , changing orientation to follow the sun .
Others grow toward the position of the sun at noon .
As the flower faces the sun it provides a resting spot for a variety of insects , being slightly warmer than surrounding surfaces . This species is actinorhizal , able to live in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria .
It can also form a symbiosis with the mushroom &amp; quot ; Hebeloma cylindrosporum &amp; quot ; via an ectomycorrhiza . This plant is common in many Arctic regions , growing in several types of cold , wet habitat .
It can be found in tundra , meadows , river valleys , and scree slopes .
It anchors well in rocky and gravelly substrates , and it thrives in soils with low organic content .
It is a pioneer species in rough terrain .
It likely colonized wide areas of the Arctic as ice sheets receded .
This species dominates several Arctic habitat types , being the first plant to take hold in the scoured substrate and becoming the most abundant species in the area .
It dominates a dwarf heath plant community along with sedges such as &amp; quot ; Carex rupestris &amp; quot ; in Montana .
In parts of northern Alaska it codominates bare , cryoturbated soils with the lichen &amp; quot ; Ochrolechia frigida &amp; quot ; , and moist coastal flats with &amp; quot ; Carex aquatilis &amp; quot ; , a sedge . The plant &amp; apos ; s ability to colonize denuded Arctic landscapes makes it a useful tool in revegetation efforts , particularly in habitat altered by mining .
Once the plant takes hold , its dense , matlike form tends to accumulate organic matter .
Increasing the organic cover in a barren mining zone is considered an important goal in revegetation efforts . The Inuit have many names for the species , including &amp; quot ; malikkaat &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; isuqtannguat &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; isurramuat &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; piluit &amp; quot ; .
They monitored the status of the plant in order to track the seasons .

His father , Ed , sometimes played harmonica for his own enjoyment , and his mother , Marcella , sang in school and church . Murphy &amp; apos ; s formative years were spent in the Indiana towns of Peru , Wabash and Sweetser , all in adjoining counties .
He graduated from Oak Hill High School , Marion College ( now Indiana Wesleyan University ) and Indiana University , where he earned an MBA . When Murphy was in the 4th grade , his family moved to Wabash , Indiana .
His first instrument was an Arthur Godfrey plastic ukulele with a plastic box on the fretboard that allowed a chord to be played by pushing one button .
Murphy took it off and figured out which strings to push to play his own chords .
When he was in junior high at Chippewa school in 1958 , he saved his newspaper money and bought a $ 25 tangerine and white Harmony Caribbean H-1005 flat top from the local music store .
It had a strip of aluminum cabinet trim to divide the colors on the front and the strings were not the easiest to press down , but it was a start . When he was a sophomore , the family moved to Sweetser in Grant County , close to the larger city of Marion , where his father worked at the local Fisher Body plant .
He began to take guitar lessons at Butler &amp; apos ; s music store from an old vaudeville performer , Art Oliver , and later Sy Cantrell , a local barber by trade .
Murphy started playing rhythm guitar and was lead singer in a rock and roll band he helped form , and later used his guitar for song writing . Two of his earliest influences were Ritchie Valens and Buddy Holly , who both tragically died on February 3 , 1959 in a plane crash .
His first band was The Torkays , formed after he answered a newspaper ad placed by Jim Aguilar , looking for a guitarist , and met with him at Venable ’ s café in Sweetser , Indiana on Monday , January 30 , 1961 .
Aguilar had a 1960 Gibson Les Paul Standard cherry sunburst guitar .
Murphy bought an identical one from Aguilar &amp; apos ; s former guitarist , serial number 0-1485 , and these guitars years later were valued at around $ 250,000 each .
Their first paying gig was Saturday , April 22 , 1961 at the Van Buren , Indiana Conservation Club .
They were hired by Bill Rock Sr .
for $ 25 each to play at a party to celebrate the 15th birthday of his sister , Brenda Rock , who Murphy married six years later . Aguilar and Murphy wanted to be recording artists , so they wrote some songs , recorded them on a small home tape recorder with one microphone , and took the demo tape around to several record companies .
Their first trip was to Nashville and Memphis where they auditioned the songs with such companies as Decca , and the famous Sun Records , without success . Next they drove to Chicago toward the end of 1962 , where they scored a contract with Stacy Records , after John Dolan heard their teen age tragedy song &amp; quot ; Little Loved One &amp; quot ; .
The song describes a marriage and a car accident on the way home from the honeymoon , in which the bride dies .
Stacy Records was a small but well-funded label owned by Gaylord Products , who made Gayla hair accessories and advertised on &amp; quot ; American Bandstand &amp; quot ; .
Their biggest artist was Al Casey , who had records on the charts and was a member of Duane Eddy and Lee Hazlewood groups . Since band members Murphy and Aguilar &amp; apos ; s brother Frank were underage , John Dolan came down from Chicago by train to Murphy &amp; apos ; s home .
The parents met and signed contracts on January 17 , 1963 .
There were several musicians who came into and out of the Torkays , but the three constant core members and who were on the record were Keith ( O ’ Conner ) Murphy on lead vocals and rhythm guitar , and the brothers Jim Aguilar on lead guitar and vocals , and Frank Aguilar on vocals .
The four Stacy songs were recorded in a three-hour session in the Sam Phillips studio in Nashville , from 2 : 00pm to 5 : 00pm on Saturday , February 23 , 1963 .
The other musicians on the record were the Nashville pros they called the &amp; quot ; A &amp; quot ; team : The first two songs released on Stacy were &amp; quot ; Little Loved One &amp; quot ; , which originally landed the band &amp; apos ; s contract , and &amp; quot ; Cindy Lou ! &amp; quot ; ( Stacy 958 ) .
These were released in early March , 1963 .
The company decided to release the first record under Murphy &amp; apos ; s name and not the Torkays .
For reasons never explained , they changed his name to &amp; quot ; Keith O &amp; apos ; Conner &amp; quot ; . The central US east of the Mississippi and the northeast was playing &amp; quot ; Little Loved One &amp; quot ; .
In April 1963 the song was in the top 10 on the WABY Albany , New York list , and number 16 on the WISH hit list in Indianapolis .
Murphy appeared on TV in several Indiana cities .
Meanwhile , the South was playing &amp; quot ; Cindy Lou &amp; quot ; .
Aguilar and Murphy went on a promotional tour to New Orleans where &amp; quot ; Cindy Lou &amp; quot ; was listed as &amp; quot ; best of the new releases &amp; quot ; , and made an appearance on regional TV with The Champs , who played &amp; quot ; Tequila &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Limbo Rock &amp; quot ; .
Columbia Records took notice and offered to buy the contract from Stacy for around $ 20,000 , but Stacy declined , sensing a hit and not needing the money . In 2002 Murphy was inductee number 200 into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame on the strength of &amp; quot ; Cindy Lou &amp; quot ; , which is collected worldwide and is considered one of the final original era of rockabilly songs issued before the British invasion .
Jim and Frank Aguilar were also recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame for their contributions to the recordings . The next two sides were &amp; quot ; Karate &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; I Don &amp; apos ; t Like It &amp; quot ; ( Stacy 960 ) by The torkays , released in late April , 1963 .
Stacy thought both records would be hits , and they wanted to own two acts .
To make sure no one caught on that these were the same performers , they changed the songwriter credits on the Torkays &amp; apos ; record to Angus ( Aguilar ) and O &amp; apos ; Neil ( Murphy ) .
&amp; quot ; Karate &amp; quot ; was a novelty rocker and marked the first time in the US that a vocal had used martial arts as a theme .
After playing from 1961 through 1963 , the Torkays amicably disbanded .
Murphy did some work at Jan Hutchens &amp; apos ; Tigre Records studio in Indianapolis for the next few years , and gave guidance to local Grant County groups .
Murphy &amp; apos ; s next band was The Daze .
The lineup never changed from 1965 to 1968 , and consisted of the following members : The Daze played at many venues throughout Indiana and surrounding states , and was one of the more popular groups in the area .
They often performed in the greater Detroit area , including at the Roostertail , as their manager Ray Skop lived there . In 1967 they landed a contract with the iconic King Records based in Cincinnati , which was known mostly for rhythm and blues acts such as James Brown , Hank Ballard , Bill Doggett , Wynonie Harris , and Little Willie John .
In May 1968 they recorded two of Murphy &amp; apos ; s songs , which were released on the King label September 19 , 1968 ( King 45-6171 ) .
The songs were &amp; quot ; Slightly Reminiscent of Her &amp; quot ; and its flip side , &amp; quot ; Dirty Ol &amp; apos ; Sam &amp; quot ; .
The band members were the only musicians on the record . Around this time period the owner of King Records , Syd Nathan , died March 2 , 1968 , and promotion efforts were in chaos .
This was likely one of the last records released that Nathan approved .
It was one of the last 50 or so that was released by King , before the label was purchased by Starday in October 1968 , and the records noted &amp; quot ; Distributed by Starday-King Records &amp; quot ; .
King historian Chris Richardson noted &amp; quot ; Keith Murphy &amp; amp ; the Daze would help King Records expand its popular reach into the emerging “ psychedelic ” rock market May of 1968 would find the recording of King ’ s first “ psych ” 45 with “ Slightly Reminiscent of Her ” , perhaps the only Psychedelic release .
The single ’ s recording , however , would take place against the backdrop of ( 1 ) label founder Syd Nathan ‘ s passing two months prior in March , ( 2 ) followed , in April , by civil unrest in the neighborhoods adjacent to Cincinnati ’ s Evanston neighborhood – King ’ s home base – when Martin Luther King , Jr .
was assassinated in Memphis &amp; quot ; .
The King Records headquarters and studio were designated in 2009 with a marker as the second Rock and Roll Hall of Fame historical landmark site . The record later became a valuable record to collectors , priced up to $ 1,000 in record books .
Again , as in the case of Stacy Records , King decided to release it with Murphy headlining as &amp; quot ; Keith Murphy and The Daze &amp; quot ; .
In England Polydor Records released the recordings ( Polydor 56542 ) with a slightly longer end on &amp; quot ; Slightly Reminiscent of Her &amp; quot ; and designated the &amp; quot ; A &amp; quot ; side as &amp; quot ; Dirty Ol &amp; apos ; Sam &amp; quot ; . The band was together from about 1965 through 1968 .
The Vietnam War was heating up and Murphy enrolled in the local Marion College , now called Indiana Wesleyan University .
He later received an MBA from Indiana University .
In later years ( 1999 ) he wrote and recorded the theme song for a television series &amp; quot ; Outdoor USA &amp; quot ; .
In 2008 he wrote the song &amp; quot ; Tiddlywink &amp; quot ; featured on the &amp; quot ; Rock In Threes ! &amp; quot ; album by the noted German rockabilly group Black Raven .
At least three of Murphy &amp; apos ; s recordings have been re-released on US and European compilation albums .
In June 2012 he recorded and released a CD and digital album , &amp; quot ; The Class of 1962 &amp; quot ; , as &amp; quot ; Keith O &amp; apos ; Conner Murphy &amp; quot ; , for his Oak Hill High School 50th class reunion .
The album included a new song by the same name , which he wrote and sang , and which was reviewed by the Recording Academy for a Grammy nomination in 2013 in the Americana category .
The album also included his original 1960s songs .
In June 2017 , Keith recorded &amp; quot ; Tiddlywink &amp; quot ; , the song he had written for Germany &amp; apos ; s Black Raven and replaced their version with his own in a reissued &amp; quot ; The Class of 1962 &amp; quot ; .
It was reviewed by the Recording Academy for a Grammy nomination in 2018 in the Best Rock Performance category .
In April 2018 Black Raven of Germany , again featured one of Keith &amp; apos ; s songs from the 60 &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Karate ! &amp; quot ; on their album in CD , Vinyl , and even Cassette tape , titled &amp; quot ; Rockbox Revival &amp; quot ; .
Black Raven was Kris Kristofferson &amp; apos ; s band for his European tour , and along with Keith , provided one of the few non-band songs on the album . Murphy married Brenda Rock , the girl whose 15th birthday party was his first paying gig .
They have two daughters , Michelle and Monica .
He is Top Pop at his marketing research firm Lollipop Research Company .

Cape Race LighthouseCape Race Lighthouse is an active lighthouse located in Avalon Peninsula , Newfoundland .
The light &amp; apos ; s characteristic is a single white flash every 7 . 5 seconds , additionally a foghorn may sound a signal of two blasts every 60 seconds .
It is located on one of Canada &amp; apos ; s busiest shipping lanes .
The lighthouse is also a tourist attraction . In 1856 , the first lighthouse was installed by the British Government &amp; apos ; s Trinity House .
It was a cast iron tower with a coal oil lamp turned by clockwork .
In 1872 the lighthouse keeper was Patrick Myrick ; members of his family continued to operate the lighthouse for more than 100 years .
In 1886 responsibility for operation of the lighthouse was transferred to the Dominion of Canada . In 1904 the &amp; # 91 ; Guglielmo Marconi &amp; # 124 ; Marconi Company &amp; # 93 ; set up a wireless radio station at the lighthouse .
The cast iron tower was replaced in 1907 by a tall concrete tower and a light with a massive hyperradiant Fresnel lens made by Chance Brothers in England .
It &amp; apos ; s optic emitted a one million candle power flash .
Great landfall lights like those at Cape Race provided the first sight of land for Atlantic travelers . After the new tower was built , the original lighthouse was moved to Cape North ; it now stands in front of the National Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa . The Cape Race Lighthouse was in the news in April 1912 , when it received the &amp; quot ; Titanic &amp; quot ; distress call , an unusual event for radio technology of the era . The lighthouse was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1975 . In 2006 , David Myrick , with help from Noel and Liam Myrick - part of a lineage of Myrick lighthouse keepers at Cape Race , contributed wood from the cabinet housing the motor driving the Fresnel to the Six String Nation project .
Part of this material serves as the heel brace at the joint of the neck and body of &amp; quot ; Voyageur &amp; quot ; , the guitar at the heart of the project .

Koppers Co . , Inc .
( KCI ) Superfund SiteThe Koppers Co . , Inc .
( KCI ) Superfund Site is one of three Superfund sites in Oroville , California , along with Louisiana Pacific Sawmill and Western Pacific Railyard .
The KCI Superfund Site is a 200-acre site which served as a wood treatment plant for 50 years .
Wood was treated with many chemicals to prevent wood deterioration .
The accumulation of these chemicals from spills , fires , and uses has caused this site to be contaminated with the hazardous waste material .
Due to soil and groundwater contamination , the site was placed on the National Priorities List in 1984 for remedial action plans to clean up the site to protect surrounding residential areas concerning environmental and human health risks . The KCI Superfund site was originally a mining operation in the 1900s .
The Hutchinson Lumber Mill operated from 1920 to 1948 .
In 1955 , Koppers Co . , Inc .
purchased the property from National Wood Treatment Company .
Koppers later sold the company to Beazer East , Inc . , which then later re-sold it to Koppers Industries , Inc .
The company closed down the wood treatment facility in 2001 .
Beazer East , Inc .
again bought out the company and sold the land with its contaminated soils into two landfills to Gold Line Express Inc .
Beazer East Inc .
is known to be the responsible party for the outcome of the site . From 1948 to 2001 , the Oroville Plant conducted the wood treatment operations to prevent wood from deteriorating .
In 1963 , an on-site fire released 20,000 gallons of pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) from tanks onto the soil .
Another fire was documented in 1987 releasing high levels of dioxins .
With many orders and remedial actions to clean up the site , KCI Superfund Site is under monitored recovery to clean the affected groundwater and soil contamination .
The goal is to return the original source of groundwater to the 10,650 people living in the surrounding area . The process of wood treatment requires many chemicals such as pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) , dioxins , dibenzofuran , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) , and heavy metals such as copper , chromium , and arsenic .
PCP was first discovered in groundwater and in nearby residential wells in 1971 .
The most abundant of these chemicals present at the superfund site is PCP .
Long-term exposure to low levels of PCP , through soil exposure or water exposure , can lead to carcinogenic , renal , and neurological effects .
The Environmental Protection Agency &amp; apos ; s maximum contaminant level in water is 1 parts per billion ( ppb ) .
Some wells most recently measured at the site in 2007 still had concentrations of PCP above 15 ppb . All of these hazardous chemicals can cause liver damage , reproductive effects , neurobehavioral effects , immunotoxic effects , and developmental effects .
Orders for cleanup were issued two years after PCP was first discovered and no serious human effects were reported .
Many preventive actions have been implemented from the state and federal districts .
From 1984 to 1986 , bottled water was supplied to residential areas whose drinking supply was impacted .
Thirty-four private residences were also connected with alternate water supply from the Oroville-Wyandotte Irrigation District .
As of 2008 , of those initial thirty-four residences , seven are still supplied the alternate water supply , compensated by Beazer East Inc .
for their annual water bill .
Groundwater has been monitored since 1985 for on and off sites .
The site has been under surveillance , and federal intervention has kept many further human health risks from escalating . In 1973 , the Regional Water Quality Control Board ( RWQCB ) first discovered PCP in nearby ground-water wells used as a source of residential drinking water .
The control board issued several orders from 1973 to 1982 for cleanup of all contaminated groundwater , installation of groundwater recovery wells , and construction of wastewater treatment processes to end the use of unlined ponds and excavation of debris from the site 1963 fire .
Koppers installed two recovery wells to recover PCP from local groundwater in accordance with the RWQCB .
The RWQCB order was retracted after PCP concentrations decreased in off-site wells in 1974 .
However , in 1982 , Koppers was issued a cease-and-desist order by the RWQCB to end the discharge of PCP into soil and ground water at the wood treatment plant and ordered a plan for mitigating the source , future prevention of chemical contamination , and remediation of contaminants . The EPA created the National Priorities List in 1982 to identify and prioritize hazardous waste sites and facilities that warrant remedial actions .
On September 8 , 1983 , the site was first proposed for placement on the National Priorities List .
The site was designated as a Superfund site on September 21 , 1984 .
Groundwater monitoring was initiated in September 1984 , and then in June 1985 , the use of PCP in wood treatment was phased out .
In April 1987 , the EPA issued a unilateral removal order to conduct the cleanup , removal of contaminated soil .
A temporary chip-seal cap was constructed in order to stop leaking of contaminants through the soil and into the groundwater .
In May 1989 a record of decision for cleanup of groundwater and soil was issued for the site .
Four specified soil units were removed and landfilled .
Extraction wells and treatment plants were installed to treat contaminated groundwater by carbon adsorption for both on and off-property sites .
In March 1993 groundwater remediation began .
Treatment of groundwater was augmented to include bioremediation to treat PCP .
Contaminated soil removal began in 1995 and completed in 2002 .
The second five-year review was completed in February 2003 .
The remedial actions were deemed protective and was stated in the third five-year report released in 2008 .
The next five-year review was expected to be released in July 2013 .
The site is still on the National Priorities List due to contaminated groundwater .
The estimated date of cleanup completion and removal from the National Priorities List is September 2025 .

Manitoba Provincial Road 586Manitoba Provincial Road 586 is a former provincial road in the Canadian province of Manitoba .
It is sometimes called &amp; quot ; Alpine Road . &amp; quot ; The route began at PTH 83 north of Durban , and met PR 486 just south of the village .
From there , it ascends into the Duck Mountains .
Near Alpine , the road curves towards the west and meets PTH 83 again .
The route was mostly gravel , with a very small paved portion from PTH 83 to PR 486 near Durban . In the early 1990s , the Manitoba government decommissioned a number of provincial secondary roads and returned the maintenance of these roads back to the rural municipalities ; PR 586 was one of these roads .
The route is now maintained by the Rural Municipality of Swan River . When PR 586 was decommissioned , the paved portion of the route became part of PR 486 .
Thus PR 486 now terminates at PTH 83 rather than in Durban .
The rest of the route still sees a moderate amount of traffic and is wider than most municipal roads .
Several provincial roadsigns still remain along the route .

United States presidential election in New York , 1980The 1980 United States presidential election in New York took place on November 4 , 1980 .
All fifty states and The District of Columbia , were part of the 1980 United States presidential election .
New York voters chose forty one electors to the Electoral College , which voted for President and Vice President . New York was won by former California Governor Ronald Reagan , in a narrow victory against President of the United States Jimmy Carter , who failed to gain reelection against Reagan .
Also in the running was Independent candidate Congressman John B .
Anderson of Illinois , who ran in New York as the Liberal Party candidate .
Reagan won the state with a plurality of 46 . 66 percent of the vote to Carter ’ s 43 . 99 percent , a margin of 2 . 67 percentage points .
Anderson finished in third , with 7 . 54 percent .
New York &amp; apos ; s election results reflect the Republican Party &amp; apos ; s re-consolidation of base under what is popularly called the “ Reagan Revolution , ” which sounded various overwhelming conservative electoral victories across the United States throughout the 1980s - and most evidently against the relatively unpopular President Carter during the 1980 presidential election .
New York weighed in for this election as more Democratic than the national average by about 7 percentage points .
This election is notable in that , while the highly populated regions of New York City , Buffalo , and Albany turned out for Carter , the election in the state was tipped by the majority of less-populated upstate counties , combined with heavily populated suburban counties around NYC , most of which were won by Reagan .
Carter actually picked up plurality wins in two counties which he had lost in 1976 : Monroe County , home to the city of Rochester , and Niagara County .
A major contributing factor to Reagan ’ s victory over Carter was the relatively strong third party showing by independent candidate John B .
Anderson , a former liberal Republican congressman who garnered 8 % of the vote in the State – twice the 4 percentage point margin by which Carter had won New York in 1976 .
Running on the ballot line of New York ’ s Liberal Party , Anderson attracted the votes of many liberals and moderates who normally leaned Democratic but were dissatisfied with the policies of the Carter Administration , thus splitting the left-leaning vote in New York State .
In the heavily populated , and very liberal , five boroughs of New York City , Carter still won overall , and Reagan made only modest gains in vote share over Gerald Ford ’ s 1976 showing of 33 percent , taking 37 % in the city in 1980 .
However , although still winning 4 out of 5 boroughs , Carter bled a considerable support in the city to Anderson , dropping from 66 percent in 1976 to only 55 percent .
Since Democratic victories in New York State in that era depended on running up massive margins in New York City to overcome the rest of the state ’ s Republican lean , the reduced margin in the city from vote-splitting would prove fatal to Carter ’ s chances in 1980 .
While Reagan only bled about one percent off Republican base support in the state ( winning a plurality in a 3-way-race with 46 . 66 percent while Gerald Ford had lost the state in a two-man race with 47 . 52 percent in 1976 ) , Carter bled nearly eight percent off his 1976 support , falling from a 51 . 95 percent majority win in 1976 to a losing 43 . 99 percent in 1980 , most of those lost Democratic base votes going to Anderson instead .
This remains the last election in which a Republican presidential nominee has won traditionally rock-ribbed GOP Tompkins County in upstate New York , home to the college town of Ithaca , where Cornell University and Ithaca College are located .
At this point , Tompkins County had gone Democratic since the Civil War only in the landslides of 1912 and 1964 , with FDR never topping 40 percent .
Reagan narrowly won the county with a plurality of 42 percent to Carter ’ s 40 percent , while Anderson took nearly fourteen percent , making it Anderson ’ s strongest county in the state .
In 1984 , Tompkins County would vote against Reagan and in the following years it would become the most Democratic county in upstate New York , giving Barack Obama over seventy percent of the vote in 2008 .

She posted a FINA A-standard of 2 : 13 . 01 ( 200 m butterfly ) from the European Championships in Madrid , Spain , allowing her to include 200 and 400 m freestyle in her event line-up .
On the second day of the Games , Stojanovska placed twenty-seventh overall in the 400 m freestyle .
Swimming in heat two , she cleared a 4 : 20 barrier by posting a time of 4 : 19 . 39 to take a fourth seed over Jamaica &amp; apos ; s Janelle Atkinson .

Swimming in heat three , she rounded out a field of eight swimmers to last place with a time of 2 : 16 . 51 , nearly four seconds off the national record held by Mirjana Boševska . Shortly after her second Olympics , Stojanovska took a break from international swimming to focus on her studies .
In 2007 , she graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a bachelor &amp; apos ; s degree in aerospace engineering , effectively ending her sporting career .
Stojanovska also admitted that mathematics and science were her favorite subjects in high school , prompting her to pursue a college degree .
Oil mistOil mist refers to oil droplets suspended in the air in the size range 1 ~ 10 µm . Oil mist may form when high pressure fuel oil , lubricating oil , hydraulic oil , or other oil is sprayed through a narrow crack , or when leaked oil connects with a high temperature surface vaporizes and comes in contact with low air temperature . This happens while the fluids interact with the moving parts during machining . Smaller oil droplets than oil mist are difficult to generate under normal circumstances . Bigger oil droplets than oil mist remain in spray form ; this has the advantage of a higher ignition temperature .
It sinks easily , reducing fire hazard .
Oil mist inside the crankcase can cause a bigger problem . When the concentration of oil mist increases and reaches the lowest explosion level ( LEL ; 50 mg / ℓ , as defined by the IACS ) , explosion may occur when the mist contacts surfaces of over or a spark . The International Association of Classification Societies ( IACS ) mandates that all ships with a cylinder diameter greater than 300mm or engine power over 2,250 kW must be equipped with either bearing temperature detectors or oil mist detectors .

Arbuthnot Bank crashThe Arbuthnot Bank crash is the fall of Arbuthnot Bank , a premier British-owned financial institution in Madras Presidency , British India in October 1906 .
The incident is considered to be one of the key events which influenced the Indian independence movement in Tamil Nadu . In the last quarter of 1906 , Madras ( now Chennai ) was hit by the worst financial crisis the city was ever to suffer .
Of the three best-known British commercial names in 19th-century Madras , one crashed ; a second had to be resurrected by a distress sale ; and the third had to be bailed out by a benevolent benefactor .
Macfadyen , one of the partners , engaged in speculation , in the process losing huge amounts of the firm &amp; apos ; s money .
Prior to its collapse , Arbuthnots employed between 11,000 and 12,000 people , had 7,000 creditors and £ 1,000,000 in liabilities .
It was ascertained that the liabilities of Macfadyen &amp; apos ; s were £ 400,000 and there were 1,000 creditors .
It was agreed by the English trustee in bankruptcy and the official assignee in Madras that the assets of the two insolvent firms were to be treated as one and the same business , all creditors were to be entitled to share rateably in the pooled assets . Macfadyen committed suicide by throwing himself under a train in 1906 , and both firms had to close their doors .
Both Macfadyen and Arbuthnot were consistently over-optimistic concerning their speculations .
Arbuthnot was tried for the fraudulent activities the collapse revealed , and received a sentence of &amp; quot ; 18 months rigorous imprisonment &amp; quot ; . The depositors approached eminent lawyer V .
Krishnaswami Iyer who fought Arbuthnot Bank on their behalf and obtained a compensation for them .
Later , he was one of the founder-directors of Indian Bank which was founded upon the ruins of Arbuthnot Bank .

Canals in AustraliaCanals in Australia are particularly rare although there are a few navigable waterways or other types of canals in the country .
The following list provides a summary of known navigable waterways and other types of constructed or artificial waterways in Australia . Alexandra Canal is a tributary of the Cooks River , in southern Sydney , which was constructed along a route from the inner Sydney suburb of Alexandria , through the St Peters and Mascot , past Sydney &amp; apos ; s Sydney Airport to the Cooks River at Tempe , eventually discharging into Botany Bay .
The canal is wide , increasing to at its mouth and is one of only two navigable canals constructed in New South Wales . Hawthorne Canal is an artificial waterway on a southern tributary of the Parramatta River , west of Sydney Harbour .
It was constructed from January 1890 to improve drainage and provide ferry access operated by the Drummoyne – Leichhardt Ferry Company . Berry &amp; apos ; s Canal was Australia &amp; apos ; s first transport canal .
In June 1822 , Alexander Berry sailed his 15-tonne cutter Blanche from Sydney 150 km down the south coast to the Shoalhaven loaded with tools and provisions .
Hamilton Hume , who later became a well-known explorer , was also on board .
On 21 June 1822 , the entrance to Shoalhaven Heads appeared dangerous and four men volunteered to test it in the cutter &amp; apos ; s boat .
The boat capsized drowning two of the men .
Berry then sailed up the Crookhaven River but was stopped by a sand spit .
Undaunted , the crew hauled the Blanche across the spit .
Four days later Hamilton Hume was left with three men at the isthmus to cut a passage using only hand tools .
The canal , which was 191 m long , was completed in 12 days .
This was the first transport canal to be cut in Australia .
The river has since cut the passage wider and deeper to its present dimensions , making it now the real entrance to the Shoalhaven River . Schulz Canal is an artificial waterway in Nundah , Queensland that enters Moreton Bay .
It was constructed in the 1940s as a flood mitigation measure and is named after Toombul shire alderman William Schulz . The Denison Canal is a man-made waterway at Dunalley in southern Tasmania across the East Bay Neck of the Tasman Peninsula .
It was constructed in 1905 to shorten the fishing and trade routes between the east coast and Hobart .
It is named after Governor William Denison . The Coode Canal was constructed in 1886-92 , to designs for Sir John Coode by the Melbourne Harbour Trust to shorten and straighten the route up the Yarra River to Melbourne &amp; apos ; s docks . The Sale Canal was commenced in the 1880s , to a design of Sir John Coode linking the town via the Thomson River and the Gippsland Lakes to the open sea .
It was completed in 1890 , with the Sale Swing Bridge built in 1883 across the canal along with a high wharf , and a launching ramp .
It is longest true canal in Australia at about 5 km long . The Coal Canal was constructed in the 1870s and 80s , initially as part of the drainage works for reclaiming the West Melbourne Swamp , and was enlarged to allow coal barges to unload imported coal for the North Melbourne Locomotive Depot . The Elwood Canal began construction in May 1889 under the supervsion of municipal engineer Carlo Catani ( 22 April 1852 – 20 July 1918 ) .
The Elwood area was originally low-lying wetlands surrounding Elster Creek until the canal was constructed to drain the wetlands and make it a habitable area .
Construction commenced in May 1889 , with the contractors , Messrs Hendon , Clarke &amp; amp ; Anderson , engaging sixty workmen at a cost of £ 14,000 . The Marbyrnong Explosives Magazine Canal was constructed in 1875-76 and opened in 1878 , as part of the large Victorian government explosives reserve , known as &amp; quot ; Jack &amp; apos ; s Magazine &amp; quot ; .
The magazine was intended for bonded storage of all gunpowder coming into the colony , and was used for both military and industry , in particular the growing hard rock mining industry .
Barges transferred explosives from ships in Hobsons Bay up the Maribyrnong River and into the 400m long canal then , offload at the canal dock just outside the magazine walls .
A tramway also ran along the length of the canal , with another section going from the loading dock into the magazine proper . Burswood Canal was constructed in the 1830s across a meander bend of the Swan River at Burswood .
It was made to shorten the journey on the Swan river , between Fremantle and Guildford . It is bridged by the south western railway .

The Egg Salad Equivalency &amp; quot ; The Egg Salad Equivalency &amp; quot ; is the twelfth episode of the sixth season of the American comedy television series &amp; quot ; The Big Bang Theory &amp; quot ; .
The episode was originally aired the CBS television network on January 3 , 2013 .
The story was created by Chuck Lorre , Eric Kaplan and Jim Reynolds , then turned into teleplay by Steven Molaro , Bill Prady and Steve Holland .
Mark Cendrowski directed the episode . &amp; quot ; The Egg Salad Equivalency &amp; quot ; received positive reviews from critics .
In the United States , this episode was watched by 19 . 25 million viewers and received 6 . 1 / 18 percent rating among adults between 18 and 49 , ranking first in both its timeslot and the night . Sheldon ’ s assistant , Alex , flirts with Leonard a little more openly , and he finally picks up on it .
Leonard is intrigued by the prospect of being liked by two women at the same time , but he has no feelings for Alex whatsoever ; he just likes the attention .
When he discusses how to handle this issue with the guys , Sheldon immediately voices his displeasure with the scenario , feeling that Alex should focus on him alone .
Sheldon covertly tries to get advice from Penny , Amy , and Bernadette about what to do using a thinly disguised scenario , but Penny figures out that he is referring to Leonard and Alex and gets irritated , even being more upset when Sheldon off-handedly reveals that Leonard enjoys Alex &amp; apos ; s flirtation .
Sheldon tries to talk to Alex about it directly , but his graphic suggestions and inappropriate comments about women cause her to file a sexual harassment complaint .
Sheldon has the same problem with the Human Resources Administrator , calling black woman Jeanine a &amp; quot ; slave &amp; quot ; to her biological urges , and tries to explain himself discussing a woman &amp; apos ; s menstrual cycle .
Frustrated , Sheldon dishes out dirt on some of the inappropriate things the other guys have done in the past .
Near the end of the episode , Raj , Howard , and Leonard are waiting after calls to report to HR .
Sheldon appears and he tells her that he is filing a sexual harassment complaint because she made him feel uncomfortable .
She calls them all into her office .
Apparently , Sheldon is required to take an online sexual harassment course , which he of course assigns to Alex after explaining to her why he has to take it , but deeming his time &amp; quot ; much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this . &amp; quot ; Leonard gives Penny a musical apology about Alex &amp; apos ; s hitting on him .
He also discovers that Penny can be insecure about their relationship though they make up after Leonard tells her that Alex means nothing to him .
At the end of the episode , Penny decides to get over her insecurities by wearing a pair of eyeglasses to look smarter , which makes Leonard feel turned on . &amp; quot ; The Egg Salad Equivalency &amp; quot ; originally aired on CBS on January 3 , 2013 .
The episode was watched 19 . 25 million viewers and received 6 . 1 / 18 percent rating among adults between 18 and 49 .
It was top in its timeslot , ahead of the Fox Network &amp; apos ; s reality television show &amp; quot ; Mobbed &amp; quot ; , and the repeat of National Broadcasting Company &amp; apos ; s comedy series &amp; quot ; 30 Rock &amp; quot ; , American Broadcasting Company &amp; apos ; s musical series &amp; quot ; Nashville &amp; quot ; , and The CW Television Network &amp; apos ; s drama &amp; quot ; The Vampire Diaries &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; The Big Bang Theory &amp; quot ; was also the highest rated show of the night . Jesse Schedeen from IGN gave this episode an 8 . 4 / 10 and called this episode &amp; quot ; very Sheldon-focused &amp; quot ; .
He praised the episode for &amp; quot ; plenty of Sheldon-centric humor &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; sparing but effective use of the supporting characters &amp; quot ; .
However , she also said that &amp; quot ; the final HR showdown was too brief &amp; quot ; , and Alex is useless in this episode . Oliver Sara from The A . V .
Club gave this episode an A , calling it &amp; quot ; one of the strongest episodes of &amp; quot ; The Big Bang Theory &amp; quot ; ’ s six seasons &amp; quot ; , in which Sheldon &amp; apos ; s comments to women reached &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Curb Your Enthusiasm &amp; quot ; levels of awkwardness &amp; quot ; .

Circular arc hullThe circular arc hull is a design for boat hulls created by Swedish engineer Fredrik Ljungström .
In the 1930s and 1940s Ljungström designed and built sailboats , commonly called the Ljungström sailboat . The frames , or ribs , of a circular arc hull all have the same radius .
On Fredrik Ljungström &amp; apos ; s first models , frames were a cross-section ( a single arc ) , but he soon realized that he needed a slightly narrower profile to cope with the sea .
The result was that two arcs met at the bottom so that a slightly pointed bottom was created .
The frames are tilted toward the mast so that the stern and bow lean while standing straight up . Ljungström &amp; apos ; s yachts lack a traditional keel stock .
The lower plank is twice as wide .
Its curvature is a circular arc with its radius approximately equal to the length of the mast . The table planks consist entirely of parallel ribs that begin and end at the rail .
The bottom ( longest ) plank runs from stem to stern and the top two ( shortest ) are located amidships at the railing on the port and starboard sides of the boat . The circular arc hull &amp; apos ; s advantages are mainly in flow and manufacturing / engineering fields .
Ljungström was an expert technical designer and knew that every surface and curvature change causes impaired flow .
Constant radii worked the best .
The consistent use of arcs in a hull shape provides maximum stiffness and strength , with which thinner skins can be used . For boat builders , the circular arc hull has several advantages : The completed hull has relatively small surface area for its size , this reduced wetted area also reducing skin friction .
Moreover , there are no plank ends that suck water into the wood . The circular arc hull is very well suited for so-called strip building , where the hull is built of thin , wooden slats as a distance material between fiberglass and epoxy . The circular arc hull , as a shallow , V-shaped hull , is not ideal for a rough sea as it does not cleave the waves .
However , it can have a tendency to swage . This lightweight construction has a large number of thin ribs and planks .
Thus , there may be more movement within the hull than in sturdier designs .

Königswinter stationKönigswinter station is a station on the East Rhine Railway ( ) in the city of Königswinter in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis district of North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany .
It is a protected as a monument .
The station was opened on 11 July 1870 as part of the extension of the East Rhine Railway from Neuwied to Oberkassel . At its core the entrance building , which was built in 1869 / 70 , is a -storey stucco building with neoclassical influences .
It has an avant-corps with three portals , covered by a gable with an oeil-de-boeuf .
The station is particularly notable for an iron and glass structure that provides covered access to the island platform .
In the 1950s , a glass-enclosed porch and extensions were built on both sides the station building , which were designed as the station restaurant and for the handling of freight .
At the same time the interior was also redesigned . The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station .
The station building belonged to the city from 2004 and was sold at the end of 2012 to a real estate company .
In 2013 , it is to be adapted to be used for , among other things , a restaurant , including outdoor eating .
The underpass connects the platform with Königswinter ’ s old town to the west and to the premises of the Hayes Lemmerz company to the east .
Jimmy Forsyth ( photographer ) Jimmy Forsyth ( 15 August 1913 – 11 July 2009 ) was a British amateur photographer , who in his later life became celebrated for his portrayal of the working class communities of Tyneside and received wide recognition for this achievement prior to his death aged 95 .
He was equally accomplished in showcasing both the people and the environment of his chosen locality . Forsyth was born on 15 August 1913 at 24 Trinity Street Barry , South Wales the son of John and Bertha Forsyth .
The family had originally hailed from Garmouth in Morayshire .
Forsyth was educated at High Street School Barry . He left school at 14 without any formal qualifications and became an apprentice fitter .
After completing his apprenticeship in 1934 he found it hard to find regular work .
Through 1936 – 37 he was in the Merchant Navy .
During World War Two fitters were valued tradesmen and Forsyth came to Newcastle aged 30 in 1943 .
He found digs in Elswick off Scotswood Road , near the great Elswick Ordnance Factory .
His war work however took him to a new ICI factory a few miles up the Tyne Valley at Prudhoe .
The next few years proved complicated .
Only a few days into the job at Prudhoe an industrial accident blinded him for life in one eye .
He was able to work at the ICI factory until he was dismissed in 1946 .
His subsequent attempts at gaining paid employment proved frustrating and included a further industrial accident . Forsyth &amp; apos ; s photographic career started a while before 1954 .
As an unemployed man he started to photograph the city surrounding him and when he could sell the results .
That he combined an unusual ability coupled with overcoming financial and physical impairment was remarkable although recognition of this took time .
His presence in the west end of Newcastle also coincided with major social change as terraced housing and heavy industry gave way to high rise flats and green space .
Although he had no formal training Forsyth developed a systematic approach , indexing his images and carefully identifying their subjects .
Recognition started with a first exhibition in 1979 and then the Side Gallery mounting an exhibition in 1981 .
It accelerated with a combination of a TV documentary and a Bloodaxe Books volume &amp; quot ; Scotswood Road &amp; quot ; in 1986 .
Thereafter an Open University Honorary Degree and two more books prepared in his lifetime followed .
As time passed Forsyth worked in both monochrome and colour . His collection was safeguarded at his death and is now in public ownership in Newcastle .
The work towards this end had started with Jimmy &amp; apos ; s full co-operation and a grant from Northern Arts in the early 1990s .
A fourth book of his work &amp; quot ; An Innocent Eye &amp; quot ; was published in May 2013 .
For camera equipment he started with a Coronet Camera Company 127 &amp; quot ; box &amp; quot ; camera .
This was followed with a Rolleiflex bought secondhand for the relatively immense sum of £ 20 . Forsyth never married .
Having moved to Tyneside he lived in a succession of digs and apartments .
An early abode he called &amp; quot ; a half brothel &amp; quot ; .
From 1952 he was in a Tyneside flat at 353 Scotswood Road and this was home until the bulldozers called in 1963 .
The conclusion to his life from 1983 was spent in the development known as The Cedars .
By the very end his last months were spent in Elswick Hall care home . Exhibitions have been held firstly with &amp; quot ; Scotswood Road with a Box Camera &amp; quot ; in January 1979 and then at the Side Gallery Newcastle in 1981 .
There were other exhibitions in the West End of Newcastle .
He participated in the 2001 Gerhard Stromberg curated exhibition &amp; quot ; The Sleep of Reason &amp; quot ; . Newcastle Evening Chronicle ? ? October 1961 Jimmy Forsyth &amp; apos ; s first media appearance ( with portrait photo ) . No Fancy Shades ITV Tyne Tees Documentary . Stormy Monday Mike Figgis film in which he ( Forsyth ) was cast as a newspaper seller .
Bert StreckfussAlbert Streckfuss ( 22 September 1888 – 23 June 1974 ) was an Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League ( VFL ) . Streckfuss , a Beverley recruit , made two appearances for South Melbourne in the 1909 VFL season .
He wasn &amp; apos ; t selected in South Melbourne &amp; apos ; s premiership team but was a member of the side which defeated West Adelaide to win the Championship of Australia . In 1910 he played more regularly , making 16 appearances , two of them in the finals series .
He was involved in a controversial incident that year in a game against Carlton , knocked unconscious by a George Topping king-hit , which resulted in a field invasion .
The Carlton player was banned for 35 matches , but Streckfuss was fined ( £ 10 ) as well , after it was later revealed in court that he had earlier struck Carlton &amp; apos ; s Andrew McDonald . Streckfuss went to Williamstown in 1911 . During the 1920s , Streckfuss worked as a VFL boundary umpire .
The 109 games that he umpired includes a stint as a goal umpire in 1930 .
He officiated in eight finals .

Calculation of ZakātZakāt ( &amp; quot ; zakāt &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; that which purifies &amp; quot ; , also Zakat al-mal , &amp; quot ; zakat on wealth &amp; quot ; ) is a form of alms-giving treated as a religious tax and / or religious obligation in Islam for all Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth , and one of the Five Pillars of Islam .
Beneficiaries of zakat include zakat collectors , poor Muslims , new converts to Islam , Islamic clergy .
Zakat is prescribed to cleanse the individual &amp; apos ; s wealth , heart , and baser characteristics in general , and to replace them with virtues . Zakat is based on income and the type and value of one &amp; apos ; s assets / possessions above a minimum amount known as &amp; quot ; nisab &amp; quot ; .
The Quran does not provide specific guidelines on which types of wealth are taxable under the &amp; quot ; zakat &amp; quot ; , nor how much is to be donated , and Islamic scholars differ on how much nisab is and other aspects of zakat .
However , the amount of zakat paid on capital assets ( e . g .
money ) and stock-in-trade and jewelry is customarily 2 . 5 % ( 1 / 40 ) .
Zakat is also payable on agricultural goods , precious metals , minerals , and livestock at a rate varying between 2 . 5 and 20 percent , depending on the type of goods . Income from business , salaries and other means are traditionally exempt . While the Quran talks about the importance of zakat ( ) and gives general guidance on who should receive it ( ) , it does not specify which types of wealth are &amp; quot ; zakatable &amp; quot ; , nor how much is to be given in zakat . While some kinds of stores of wealth are mentioned in &amp; quot ; hadith &amp; quot ; in regards to zakat ( for example wheat , rye , date , raisin , camels , silver ) , many others are not .
Consequently , noted scholar of &amp; quot ; fiqh &amp; quot ; Yusuf al-Qaradawi emphasizes the importance in zakat regulation of the use of &amp; quot ; ijma &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; ( the agreement of scholars ) , and &amp; quot ; qiyas &amp; quot ; ( analogy or applying to a case the same ruling given to a similar case because of common reason ( &amp; quot ; `illah &amp; quot ; ) ) .
An example of use of &amp; quot ; ijma &amp; quot ; is the rule that zakah is &amp; quot ; obligatory on golden assets at the same rate as it is on silver &amp; quot ; , ( i . e .
one fourth of a tenth ) despite the fact that only silver had zakat ordered upon it by a hadith of Muhammad .
Zakat regulations on silver and gold are also an example of &amp; quot ; qiyas &amp; quot ; as both metals are being &amp; quot ; used in several countries as measures and store of value &amp; quot ; , and so are analogous . According to Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui , the ulema ( Islamic scholars ) are &amp; quot ; unanimous in regarding the rates of Zakat as permanently fixed by Islamic law &amp; quot ; , but &amp; quot ; a number &amp; quot ; of recent writers , &amp; quot ; mostly economists , argue in favour of making these rates amendable to modification &amp; quot ; . Al-Qaradawi quotes Imam Al-Shafi ‘ i in his &amp; quot ; Al Risalah &amp; quot ; about zakah on gold : &amp; quot ; The Prophet of God ordered zakah on silver currency and Muslims after him collected zakah on gold .
They were either depending on a saying of the Prophet that never reached our times or applying analogy because of the similarities between gold and silver as money , since both were used in several countries as measures and store of value . &amp; quot ; Jewellery and precious metals — such as gold and silver — come under Zakat even if they are used merely for decorative purposes . According to al-Qardawi , the grains and fruits mentioned in hadith on zakah are limited to wheat , rye , date and raisin .
However , the majority of scholars applied zakah on different kinds of grains and fruits by analogy to those grains and fruits mentioned by the Prophet , ( p ) l instead of restricting zakah to the items stated in the sayings .
. . .
By the same token we apply analogy on silk , milk and other animal products because they are similar to honey , which is mentioned in the Traditions .
. . .
It is reported that &amp; apos ; Umar used analogy with respect to zakah when he ordered zakah on horses after he realized that they had become high in value , saying , &amp; quot ; Should we only take one sheep out of every forty sheep and leave horses with nothing ? &amp; quot ; &amp; apos ; Umar was followed in that respect by Abu Hanifah13 . The classic &amp; quot ; fiqh &amp; quot ; nisab for dates or grain is five &amp; quot ; wasq &amp; quot ; ( 609 . 84 kg ) , so that no zakat is due if the amount of dates or grain possessed is less than that .
Zakah is payable on the gross yield of land for each crop . &amp; quot ; Zakāt &amp; quot ; on Livestock or cattle , &amp; quot ; Al-An &amp; apos ; am &amp; quot ; According to &amp; quot ; Fiqh az-Zakat &amp; quot ; by al-Qaradawi and other traditional handbooks of zakat fiqh ( such as one issued by IslamKotob , ) zakat on livestock such as sheep , cows and camels should be paid in-kind according to a detailed schedule . Livestock ( &amp; quot ; Al-An &amp; apos ; am &amp; quot ; ) and how God created them is mentioned in the Quran in Surat Al-An &amp; apos ; am ( 136 ) , and Surat An-Nahl ( 5 ) . Flocks and feeding the poor are mentioned in Surat Al-Hajj ( 28 ) . Livestock and how they will punish sinners who have not paid zakat when they reach Jahannam ( hell ) is mentioned in Hadith : Narrated Abu Dhar : Once I went to him ( the Prophet ) and he said , &amp; quot ; By Allah in Whose Hands my life is ( or probably said , &amp; apos ; By Allah , except Whom none has the right to be worshipped ) , whoever had camels or cows or sheep and did not pay their Zakat , those animals will be brought on the Day of Resurrection far bigger and fatter than before and they will tread him under their hooves , and will butt him with their horns , and ( those animals will come in circle ) : When the last does its turn , the first will start again , and this punishment will go on till Allah has finished the judgments amongst the people . &amp; quot ; ( Bukhari , Vol . 2 , Book 24 , No .
539 ) If the number of camels exceeds 120 , for each 40 more there is one she-camel two to three years old , and for each 50 additional there is one she-camel three to four years old . According to al-Qaradawi there are no prescribed nisab limits in ahadith for cows : There is no correct saying that provides us with the nisab and rates of zakah on cows as we have seen on camels .
This may be because cows were rare in the area of Hijaz ( around Makkah and Madinah ) ; it may be also because cows are close in size and value to camels , so the Prophet did not determine their rates on the assumption of their obvious similarity .
But the fact that there is no correct saying on the issue left the jurists with varying views on the determination of nisab and rates . However , the &amp; quot ; reputed position upheld by the four schools of jurisprudence &amp; quot ; is that nisab is &amp; quot ; 30 cows &amp; quot ; , and so that for 30 cows , a &amp; quot ; one-year oldcow is due &amp; quot ; , and for 40 to 59 cows a two years old cow is due , and so on ( see below ) .
There is no zakat on sheep and goats until their number reaches forty .
&amp; # 91 ; Neither male or female is specified &amp; # 93 ; . As of 2010 , Zakat was mandatory by state law and collected by the state in six Muslim majority countries : Libya , Malaysia , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , and Yemen , according to researcher Russell Powell . There were government-run but voluntary Zakat contribution programs in Bahrain , Bangladesh , Egypt , Indonesia , Iran , Jordan , Kuwait , Lebanon , and the United Arab Emirates . The states where zakat is compulsory differ in their definition of what assets ( and sometimes income ) are &amp; quot ; zakatable &amp; quot ; — eligible for contributing zakat .
A 1995 study by Fouad Abdullah al-Omar found many differences .

The vehicle had permanent four-wheel drive , Kegelraddifferenziale front and rear .
Many parts corresponded to the execution of the M6 and M8 Saurer 6x6 and 8x8 military trucks .
The engine was almost identical , but had two fewer cylinders . The model 1946 Saurer had a CR1DM four-cylinder engine with 70 horsepower .
The newer model CR2DM from 1952 had an engine with 75 HP .
All were equipped with M4 front winch , pulling 2500 kg , cable length 70 meters .

The five-speed transmission remained unchanged , as is the steering .
Since the engine was installed behind a relatively light steering and a good survey showed ahead . The close seating arrangement at 4MH was also by design .
To achieve the lowest possible car silhouette , the seats were within and not located on the wheel arches .
Consequently , there was only space in center of the vehicle .

Regarding off-road capability , he stood by his multi-wheeled brothers M6 and M8 in nothing .
While pulling heavy trailer loads in the grounds of the rear engine also played out his trump card . One is on display at the Schweizerische Militärmuseum Full and one in the Zuger Depot Technikgeschichte .

Such A Pretty GirlSuch A Pretty Girl is a 2007 young adult novel by American author Laura Wiess .
The book was first published on January 2 , 2007 through MTV Books and deals with the subject matter of a teenage girl that must deal with the reality that the father that molested and sexually abused her and several others is getting an early release from jail . After &amp; quot ; Such A Pretty Girl &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; release in 2007 , Weiss has received several letters from people of various ages relating their experiences with sexual abuse .
Weiss stated that she was inspired to write the novel after viewing a news program about sexual abuse that used the term &amp; quot ; offenders &amp; quot ; , which she felt &amp; quot ; minimized the abuse perpetrated &amp; quot ; . The story takes place over a time span of 3 days , and set in Estertown , a fictional town in New Jersey .
The story begins with Charles , Merideth &amp; apos ; s father in jail for molesting children .
Though he was sentenced to nine years , he is released after only three .
Though her mother , Sharon is thrilled , Meredith is horrified because she knows he will molest her again .
Meredith &amp; apos ; s mother , Sharon , pretends that Charles simply made a mistake and arranges for them to live near him .
The whole town avoids Merideth &amp; apos ; s family because they know Charles may try to hurt their children , with some businesses even refusing them service .
In order to escape Charles , Merideth attempts to run away several times .
The first time , she ran away to her boyfriend Andy &amp; apos ; s house .
Andy is 19 and is paralyzed since the night he graduated High School .
He and his religious mother are planning to go to Iowa to meet the victim &amp; apos ; s soul to cleanse him in the next couple of days .
The second time , she went to her Mothers mom &amp; apos ; s house , who is Mayor .
Later in the book , Meredith and Nigel , one of her friends who is a police officer , plan to catch her father .
They set cameras all around the house , especially in her room .
This is a very big help because Meredith &amp; apos ; s father tried to hurt her while her mother left them alone together .
To save herself , Meredith takes a Virgin Mary statue and hits her father with it .
Her father becomes unconscious . In the aftermath of the attack , her mom is confirmed pregnant and spent the following days by Charles &amp; apos ; side in the hospital .
Meredith is safe again and now lives at her grandmother &amp; apos ; s . Critical reception for &amp; quot ; Such A Pretty Girl &amp; quot ; has been positive .
The novel was named as one of the ALA &amp; apos ; s 2008 &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Best Books for Young Adults &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; and YALSA &amp; apos ; s 2008 &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
Trade reviews from School Library Journal , Kirkus Reviews , and Booklist praised the book &amp; apos ; s content and handling of the theme of sexual abuse .
&amp; quot ; Such A Pretty Girl &amp; quot ; also received several reviews from &amp; quot ; Kliatt &amp; quot ; , which also praised the book &amp; apos ; s themes .
Beatnik ( Buggles song ) &amp; quot ; Beatnik &amp; quot ; is a synthpop song by the British synthpop group The Buggles released in 1982 as the album &amp; apos ; s fifth single from their second and final album &amp; quot ; Adventures in Modern Recording &amp; quot ; .
It was to be both the final single from the album as well as the final single from the group as a whole .
The song was written by Trevor Horn and was produced by Horn and John Sinclair . &amp; quot ; Beatnik &amp; quot ; is a progressive rock-influenced song that is 3 minutes and 36 seconds long , and is played at a BPM of 104 .
Horn has stated that &amp; quot ; Things like &amp; apos ; Beatnik &amp; apos ; were me just messing around with gear and just having a silly idea .
I was quite fascinated by Fairlight brass and all of those kind of things that Geoffrey and I had started messing around with before he went off to join Asia . &amp; quot ; With limited involvement by Buggles member Geoff Downes , the &amp; quot ; Adventures in Modern Recording &amp; quot ; album featured much more involvement from Horn .
However , Downes contributed to four songs on the album ; &amp; quot ; Beatnik &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Vermillion Sands &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; I Am a Camera &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Lenny &amp; quot ; .
On &amp; quot ; Beatnik &amp; quot ; , Downes played the Fairlight keyboard .
Other instrumentation includes vocals , guitars , percussion and additional keyboards by Anne Dudley . The single was not released in the UK , but in France only .
It was issued on 7 &amp; quot ; vinyl via Carrere .
The single included the B-side &amp; quot ; Fade Away &amp; quot ; which was written by Horn and Sinclair , whilst being produced solely by Horn .
The song was originally released as the B-side to the 1981 single &amp; quot ; I Am a Camera &amp; quot ; before it appeared on the &amp; quot ; Beatnik &amp; quot ; single .
It would later appear as a bonus track on the 1997 Japanese re-issue of the &amp; quot ; Adventures in Modern Recording &amp; quot ; album , and the February 2010 Salvo / ZZT re-issue of the album in the UK .
The co-writer Sinclair was the producer of most tracks on the album , alongside Horn . The single featured artwork , using a photograph of Horn with his hand on a keyboard , whilst some mannequins stand behind with part of a drum kit and a guitar . Unlike &amp; quot ; I Am a Camera &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; On TV &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Lenny &amp; quot ; , the album &amp; apos ; s other singles , the song would not be re-released on iTunes as an EP in 2012 by Trevor Horn &amp; apos ; s own ZTT label . &amp; quot ; Adventures in Modern Recording &amp; quot ; became one of Billboard &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; recommended LPs &amp; quot ; in the 20 February 1982 issue , where the review highlighted the &amp; quot ; best cuts &amp; quot ; as &amp; quot ; those mentioned plus &amp; apos ; Beatnik &amp; apos ; , &amp; apos ; Adventures in Modern Recording &amp; apos ; , &amp; apos ; On T . V . &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; On 16 April 2010 , Chris Roberts reviewed the album for BBC Music , where he stated &amp; quot ; There &amp; apos ; s dazzling range to Vermillion Sands which makes Bohemian Rhapsody resemble T . V .
Eye , while Beatnik and On TV take the bustling 1970s brains of 10cc and use them as Play-Doh for Horn &amp; apos ; s desk of tricks . &amp; quot ; The Bolton News writer Martin Hutchinson reviewed the album on 4 March 2010 upon its re-issue .
He stated &amp; quot ; The title track and &amp; apos ; Beatnik &amp; apos ; are strong openers for the album . &amp; quot ; On 22 April 2010 , Soundslike Jazz reviewed the album and described &amp; quot ; Beatnik &amp; quot ; as &amp; quot ; frivolous &amp; quot ; .
Don Ignacio reviewed the album for his site , where he gave the song an &amp; quot ; A- &amp; quot ; grade and stated the song to be &amp; quot ; a mid-paced shuffle with a fun melody and quirky instrumentation .
( Maybe I should stop using &amp; apos ; quirky &amp; apos ; to describe these songs .
All of them are quirky . ) &amp; quot ;

John LawleyCommissioner John Lawley ( 31 December 1859 – 9 September 1922 ) was a Commissioner in The Salvation Army , the second highest rank attainable by Officers in the organisation , and the highest &amp; apos ; appointed &amp; apos ; rank .
An early Salvationist , he joined The Salvation Army in 1877 when it was still called The Christian Mission .
He was aide-de-camp to General William Booth from 1890 to 1912 as well as to General Bramwell Booth from 1912 to 1921 . John &amp; quot ; Johnny &amp; quot ; Lawley was born at Foulden in Norfolk in 1859 , the youngest of four children born to John Lawley ( 1835 – 1918 ) , a farm labourer , and his wife Anne ( née Feetham ; 1836 – 1924 ) .
The father was a heavy drinker , and by 1871 the entire family were in the workhouse in Swaffham in Norfolk .
Later they moved to Bradford in search of work and where &amp; quot ; Johnny &amp; quot ; was employed in a mill firstly as bobbin ligger and later as an engine cleaner . In 1877 , aged 17 , Lawley was converted at a meeting of The Christian Mission in Bradford , and soon became the Mission &amp; apos ; s fortieth evangelist .
The young Lawley wanted to wear a dress that would declare to all that he belonged to God , so he obtained a missioner-frock coat , black necktie , a wide brimmed hat , and an umbrella which he used to wave in processions . Lawley &amp; apos ; s first command was the Spennymoor Christian Mission Station which opened on 28 April 1878 .
Here he preached fourteen sermons a week .
Aged 19 he was a Captain in The Salvation Army , and by 1891 he was a Colonel .
When sent to Jarrow with another Salvationist the two met such fierce hostility that a superintendent of the police , two sergeants , and seven constables were unable to keep order .
In one open-air meeting here &amp; quot ; Lawley was thrown to the ground , and as the mob closed upon him , things were at a serious pass .
Just then a newly converted desperado fought her way to him , hauled him up by the collar , and holding him thus , with flaming eyes and clenched fist , dared the mob to touch him &amp; quot ; . Lieutenant-Commissioner Unsworth later recalled Captain Lawley at this time : &amp; apos ; The common people heard him gladly and loved him much .
I remember him in the old days , forty long years ago , in the canny North , among the miners and iron workers .
His laugh , his shout , his friendly manner , reached the hearts of many of those rough , hard-drinking men in Jarrow , in Sunderland , and all along the banks of the Tyne and Wear .
They knew him not by any title , but by the love name they gave him in the years gone by , Johnny Lawley . &amp; quot ; He married Salvation Army officer Captain Harriett Lawley ( &amp; quot ; née &amp; quot ; Charteris ) ( born 1870 ) in 1887 in Cardiff in a ceremony conducted by General William Booth ; they had five children : John Bramwell Lawley ( 1888-1967 ) , Florence Annie Lawley ( 1890-1939 ) , Herbert Douglas Lawley ( 1892-1968 ) , Evangeline Broughall Lawley ( 1893-1989 ) , and Oswald Victor Lawley ( 1895-1964 ) .
An innovative and unrestrained preacher , on one occasion while delivering a sermon about the sea of God &amp; apos ; s love and forgiveness he dived from the platform and continued his sermon while doing the breast stroke on the floor .
On other occasions he put up an umbrella and ran around in circles to attract outdoor listeners .
At another time he tore his little Song Book in shreds in order to illustrate how the Devil tears his prey . Lawley &amp; apos ; s first song for The Salvation Army was written at Jarrow in 1879 , and by 1916 he had contributed 19 of his songs to the &amp; quot ; Salvation Army Song Book &amp; quot ; , with many more in other publications .
In all , Lawley commanded eight Corps : Mountain Ash , Hayle , West Hartlepool , Stockton-on-Tees , Sunderland , Nottingham , Bristol Circus , and Plymouth .
For a period he was Chief Divisional Officer for Wales ; during this time he was promoted to Major .
While in charge of the Ipswich Division Major Lawley was sentenced to fourteen days &amp; apos ; imprisonment for obstruction . Lawley first met William Booth in Bradford soon after The Christian Mission became The Salvation Army in 1878 .
General Booth also conducted the ceremony when Lawley married Captain Harriett Charteris in 1887 in Cardiff .
Following the death of Catherine Booth in 1890 Chief of Staff Bramwell Booth acted as his father &amp; apos ; s assistant at prayer meetings and elsewhere , but it was soon realised that a full-time Officer needed to be appointed who could accompany General Booth in both his British and overseas tours .
The choice fell on Colonel Lawley who was in Scotland when a telegram from Bramwell Booth told him to meet General Booth at Durham , where a Campaign was in progress .
&amp; quot ; &amp; apos ; Lawley arrived as the General was conducting an afternoon meeting .
Slipping into a back seat , he watched the proceedings until the prayer meeting commenced , then the General motioned to him .
&amp; apos ; Here , Lawley , &amp; apos ; he said , &amp; apos ; see what you can do to help me with this . &amp; apos ; Lawley mounted a seat in the middle of the chapel , and led his first prayer meeting with the Founder .
&amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ; Afterwards , the General took him into the vestry and continued , &amp; apos ; I want some one to help me to pull , when it comes to the prayer meeting .
Some one who will give his life up to help me to capture souls .
I believe you &amp; apos ; re the man .
Will you come ? &amp; apos ; Lawley replied , &amp; apos ; Yes , General , by the grace of God I will live to be a fisher of men - but &amp; apos ; - he added , with a sudden consciousness of the strain which the call would entail , &amp; apos ; my voice and throat are very bad just now . &amp; apos ; &amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ; &amp; apos ; A few meetings will put that right , &amp; apos ; twinkled the Founder .
They knelt , and with his hand upon Lawley &amp; apos ; s shoulder , he prayed God &amp; apos ; s blessing upon the appointment .
Then the Founder exclaimed : &amp; apos ; Lawley , I &amp; apos ; ve annexed you . &amp; apos ; From that day , except when illness forbade , for twenty-two years - until the Founder lay down his sword - Lawley was ever at his side in his world-wide labours for souls . &amp; quot ; He acted as William Booth &amp; apos ; s aide-de-camp and was his loyal companion from 1890 until Booth &amp; apos ; s death in 1912 .
During services held by General Booth Lawley would often lead the prayers and sing solos .
In the early 1900s he accompanied Booth on several motorcades around Britain and went with him on various overseas tours including visits to Europe and Asia , South Africa , Japan , Australia , Canada and the USA .
En route to Australia in 1905 they stopped at Palestine where they visited various sites connected with the life of Jesus , including Bethany and the Tomb of Lazarus .
In all he travelled 500,000 miles with General Booth . After William Booth &amp; apos ; s death Lawley continued as aide-de-camp to General Bramwell Booth , whom he had first met in 1877 .
He returned from a second tour of the United States in 1921 suffering from a continual heaviness and weariness and what felt like indigestion .
General Bramwell Booth allowed him a year away from official duties in order to get better .
Lawley and his family moved to Watford in Hertfordshire where he remained active in Salvation Army matters . Lawley was diagnosed as being terminally ill with cancer , which an operation in January 1922 failed to remove .
In an article for &amp; quot ; The War Cry &amp; quot ; at this time he wrote : &amp; quot ; My old Captain is gone from mortal sight , but he does not leave me for long together .
He comes to me in my dreams ; in them I see him so plainly .
He is just his old self , and looks as he did in the days of long ago .
His beautiful old hand with the soft silken fingers , is placed upon my brow , and I feel the nervous twitch as in the past .
I have talked to my dear wife of his coming , and she said , &amp; quot ; Yes , darling , he comes to see that you are at the old business , and not going back upon your vows ! &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ; &amp; apos ; Going back ? Why should I ? Standing as I do on the frontier of two worlds , I say , and I sayit deliberately , that I have very little in my faith and fight to regret .
Yes , without doubt my old Captain helps to hold me to it ! With him at my elbow , and his grand old face shining up at me through the vista of ten years , go back I dare not ! &amp; quot ; As he lay on his death-bed semi-conscious Lawley was visited by Chief of the Staff Edward Higgins who prayed aloud beside him , not knowing if Lawley could hear him .
After Higgins had finished his prayers he bent over Lawley and said , &amp; quot ; Goodbye , Commissioner . &amp; quot ; Lawley opened his eyes and smiled and faintly whispered , &amp; quot ; Faithful .
Faithful . &amp; quot ; Lawley died on 9 September 1922 in Watford aged 62 .
Like many prominent Salvationists , he was buried in Abney Park Cemetery .
The funeral procession on 14 September 1922 was led by eight Salvation Army bands .
His memorial service that evening at the Clapton Congress Hall was led by General Bramwell Booth who said of Lawley , &amp; quot ; He sang his way through this life and he will sing his way through Eternity . &amp; quot ; His biography &amp; quot ; Commissioner Lawley &amp; quot ; by Mrs Colonel Minnie Lindasy Rowell Carpenter , was published in 1924 .
Mrs .
Colonel Carpenter evaluated his contribution as making The Salvatory Army so attractive to the common people .
&amp; quot ; This man was enabled to do something really effective for the illumination and education of multitudes of his fellows in one Nation or another &amp; quot ; she wrote .
The biography &amp; quot ; Commissioner John Lawley &amp; quot ; was published in 2010 .

The Jewelry ExchangeThe Goldenwest Diamond Corporation which does business as The Jewelry Exchange , is one of the largest diamond importers and manufacturers in the United States .
Today , there are 14 locations nationwide each within a densely populated metropolitan areas .
Its headquarters is in Tustin , California . Bill Doddridge started his career working in his stepfather ’ s pawnshop .
He had wanted to go out on his own and so he found a location to open up a pawnshop , but did not have the financing , so he opened it up for his stepfather .
In 1977 , after saving enough money , Bill finally went out on his own buy buying Buena Park Loan &amp; amp ; Jewelry , a pawnshop located in the next town over from his . It was soon apparent that Bill was not getting enough used jewelry from pawn customers to meet the demand so he began designing his own jewelry .
He realized that in many cases he could make the jewelry for less and have more trendy designs than buying used jewelry from the pawn customers .
He also started advertising loose diamonds and was able to undercut everyone else ’ s prices by maintaining low margins .
He had so many customers coming back with appraisals 3 to 4 times more than what they had paid , that in 1984 he decided to guarantee all of his jewelry to appraise for double . This guarantee still stands today . In 1986 he moved the business to Main Street in Santa Ana , California and brought jewelry manufacturing in-house .
Previously , he used to send the jobs out for setting .
Then , in 1987 he went to Israel and started importing diamonds directly .
This provided him with savings of 25-30 % on both the cost of diamonds and the jewelry he was manufacturing .
The event was important because he was now both “ Factory Direct ” and a “ Direct Diamond Importer . ” In 1988 , the jewelry business had grown so large that he decided to discontinue the pawnshop operations and focus on the jewelry business . In 1991 , Bill opened a second store in San Diego , California and in 1993 a third store in San Francisco , California .
Although the San Diego store was eventually closed , the San Francisco store was a success and did better than he expected .
He focused on the Santa Ana and San Francisco models for his future expansions . In 1994 , a competitor ( 14k Jewelry Mart Exchange ) moved right next door to their flagship store in Santa Ana , California , and posted a sign emphasizing the words “ Jewelry Exchange ” ; the “ 14K ” and “ Mart ” appearing in small letters .
Their customers found it difficult to distinguish between the two businesses .
That forced them to move to their new headquarters to Tustin , California and seek legal action against this unscrupulous competitor .
After four years of preparation , and a two-month-long trial , the court upheld the validity of their federal trademark “ The Jewelry Exchange ” , granting permanent injunction against 14K Jewelry Mart Exchange and awarded the Jewelry Exchange damages in excess of two million dollars . Today the Jewelry Exchange is one of the largest jewelry retailers in the nation due to its low-cost / high-quality jewelry .
Also 14 locations and an online ordering site allow the Goldenwest Corporation to do business with a large variety of customers around the United States and even some in Canada .
By removing middle men , the Jewelry Exchange keeps their operating cost low and in turn is able to keep retail prices low .
The jewelry exchange is known to have many seasonal specials , a large stock of loose stones , a trademarked &amp; quot ; Create your own ring &amp; quot ; option , and thousands of other jewelry options .
Nathan ShapellNathan Shapell ( March 7 , 1922 – March 11 , 2007 ) was an American Holocaust survivor , real estate developer and philanthropist . Nathan Schapelski was born on March 7 , 1922 in Poland .
He was a teenager during Nazi Germany &amp; apos ; s Invasion of Poland .
His mother was deported to the Targowa ghetto .
He was deported to the Buchenwald and Auschwitz concentration camps , but he managed to escape .
After the war , he built housing for homeless Jews in Münchberg , Germany . Shapell moved to Los Angeles , California with his wife in 1952 , after reading about it in &amp; quot ; Life &amp; quot ; magazine , and they decided to stay .
By 1955 , together with his brother David and brother-in-law Max Webb , he co-founded Shapell Industries , a real estate development company .
He served as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer . Shapell developed the MGM ranch in Thousand Oaks , California , the residential community of Kite Hill in Laguna Niguel , California , the East Lake development in Yorba Linda , and Promenade Towers , a 510-unit project in Downtown Los Angeles .
In the late 1980s , he developed Porter Ranch , California , adding commercial buildings to the residential community . With Jona Goldrich and Sol B .
Kest , Shapell developed some buildings in the Bunker Hill area of Downtown Los Angeles , including Promenade Towers , Grand Promenade and the California Plaza . From 1969 to 1984 , Shapell Industries was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange .
He built over 65,000 houses in California . Shapell served as a past President and Executive Board Member of the Academy of Achievement .
He also served on the Little Hoover Commission from 1975 to 1994 .
He also founded and Co-Chaired Building a Better Los Angeles , which raised US $ 1 million for homeless people in Los Angeles .
In 1980 , he was Chairman of California &amp; apos ; s Task Force on Affordable Housing .
In 1987 , he became President of Drug Abuse Resistance Education , an anti-drug non-profit organization in the United States .
He served on President Ronald Reagan &amp; apos ; s Private Sector Survey on Cost Control .
In 1992 , Governor Pete Wilson appointed him to the California Competitiveness Council to help boost the economy .
In 1998 , Senate President Pro-Tem Bill Lockyer appointed him to a commission to help alleviate California &amp; apos ; s overcrowding of prisons .
He was one of the founders of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum , and was appointed by President George H .
W .
Bush and reappointed twice by President Bill Clinton to its governing council . Shapell donated to the Yad Vashem , Israel &amp; apos ; s official memorial to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust , the University of Santa Clara , the University of Southern California , as well as Tel Aviv University and Bar-Ilan University in Israel .
He also supported the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center , the D . A . R . E .
program , and the Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services .
He received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Santa Clara in 1986 and from Tel Aviv University in 1987 .
He was a strong supporter of Israel , and he traveled to the frontlines to show his support to the Israel Defense Forces during the Sinai War , the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War . Shapell resided in Beverly Hills , California .
He was married to Lilly Schreiber , who died in 1994 .
She was also an Auschwitz survivor and worked as an interpreter at several of the war crimes trials .
They had a daughter , Vera Guerin .
She married a gentile , Paul Guerin , over her father &amp; apos ; s objection .
Vera inherited her father ’ s 43 percent stake in Shapell Industries . Shapell died on March 11 , 2007 , and he was buried in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery , a Jewish cemetery in Culver City , California . In November 2013 , Toll Brothers purchased the Shapell Homes housebuilding division of Shapell Industries for $ 1 . 6 billion ; his daughter Vera &amp; apos ; s share was $ 690 million .
Vera still retains a 43 percent interest in the remainder of Shappell industries which includes over 10,000 apartments , five shopping centers , and four office buildings worth an additional $ 1 . 7 billion . The Nathan Shapell Memorial Highway in Los Angeles , California is named in his honor , along with a park in Yorba Linda and the football field of Yorba Linda High School .
Spectral line shapeSpectral line shape describes the form of a feature , observed in spectroscopy , corresponding to an energy change in an atom , molecule or ion .
Ideal line shapes include Lorentzian , Gaussian and Voigt functions , whose parameters are the line position , maximum height and half-width .
Actual line shapes are determined principally by Doppler , collision and proximity broadening .
For each system the half-width of the shape function varies with temperature , pressure ( or concentration ) and phase .
A knowledge of shape function is needed for spectroscopic curve fitting and deconvolution . An atomic transition is associated with a specific amount of energy , &amp; quot ; E &amp; quot ; .
However , when this energy is measured by means of some spectroscopic technique , the line is not infinitely sharp , but has a particular shape .
Numerous factors can contribute to the broadening of spectral lines .
Broadening can only be mitigated by the use of specialized techniques , such as Lamb dip spectroscopy .
The principal sources of broadening are : Observed spectral line shape and line width are also affected by instrumental factors .
The observed line shape is a convolution of the intrinsic line shape with the instrument transfer function . Each of these mechanisms , and others , can act in isolation or in combination .
If each effect is independent of the other , the observed line profile is a convolution of the line profiles of each mechanism .
Thus , a combination of Doppler and pressure broadening effects yields a Voigt profile . A Lorentzian line shape function can be represented aswhere &amp; quot ; L &amp; quot ; signifies a Lorentzian function standardized , for spectroscopic purposes , to a maximum value of 1 ; &amp; quot ; formula _ 3 &amp; quot ; is a subsidiary variable defined aswhere &amp; quot ; p &amp; quot ; is the position of the maximum ( corresponding to the transition energy &amp; quot ; E &amp; quot ; ) , &amp; quot ; p &amp; quot ; is a position , and &amp; quot ; w &amp; quot ; is the full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) , the width of the curve when the intensity is half the maximum intensity ( this occurs at the points &amp; quot ; p &amp; quot ; = &amp; quot ; p &amp; quot ; ± w / 2 ) .
The unit of &amp; quot ; p &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; p &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; w &amp; quot ; is typically wavenumber or frequency .
The variable &amp; quot ; x &amp; quot ; is dimensionless and is zero at &amp; quot ; p &amp; quot ; = &amp; quot ; p &amp; quot ; . The Gaussian line shape has the standardized form , The subsidiary variable , &amp; quot ; x &amp; quot ; , is defined in the same way as for a Lorentzian shape .
Both this function and the Lorentzian have a maximum value of 1 at &amp; quot ; x &amp; quot ; = 0 and a value of 1 / 2 at &amp; quot ; x &amp; quot ; = ± 1 . The third line shape that has a theoretical basis is the Voigt function , a convolution of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian , where σ and γ are half-widths .
The computation of a Voigt function and its derivatives are more complicated than a Gaussian or Lorentzian . A spectroscopic peak may be fitted to multiples of the above functions or to sums or products of functions with variable parameters .
The above functions are all symmetrical about the position of their maximum .
Asymmetric functions have also been used . For atoms in the gas phase the principal effects are Doppler and pressure broadening .
Lines are relatively sharp on the scale of measurement so that applications such as atomic absorption spectroscopy ( AAS ) and Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy ( ICP ) are used for elemental analysis .
Atoms also have distinct x-ray spectra that are attributable to the excitation of inner shell electrons to excited states .
The lines are relatively sharp because the inner electron energies are not very sensitive to the atom &amp; apos ; s environment .
This is applied to X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy of solid materials . For molecules in the gas phase , the principal effects are Doppler and pressure broadening .
This applies to rotational spectroscopy , rotational-vibrational spectroscopy and vibronic spectroscopy . For molecules in the liquid state or in solution , collision and proximity broadening predominate and lines are much broader than lines from the same molecule in the gas phase .
Line maxima may also be shifted .
Because there are many sources of broadening , the lines have a stable distribution , tending towards a Gaussian shape . The shape of lines in a nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectrum is determined by the process of free induction decay .
This decay is approximately exponential , so the line shape is Lorentzian .
This follows because the Fourier transform of an exponential function in the time domain is a Lorentzian in the frequency domain .
In NMR spectroscopy the lifetime of the excited states is relatively long , so the lines are very sharp , producing high-resolution spectra .
alter the relaxation time , and hence spectral line shape , of those protons that are in water molecules that are transiently attached to the paramagnetic atoms , resulting contrast enhancement of the MRI image .
This allows better visualisation of some brain tumours . Some spectroscopic curves can be approximated by the sum of a set of component curves .
For example , when Beer &amp; apos ; s lawapplies , the measured intensity , &amp; quot ; I &amp; quot ; , at wavelength λ , is a linear combination of the intensity due to the individual components , &amp; quot ; k &amp; quot ; , at concentration , &amp; quot ; c &amp; quot ; .
ε is an extinction coefficient .
In such cases the curve of experimental data may be decomposed into sum of component curves in a process of curve fitting .
This process is also widely called deconvolution .
Curve deconvolution and curve fitting are a completely different mathematical procedures . Curve fitting can be used in two distinct ways . Spectroscopic curves can be subjected to numerical differentiation . When the data points in a curve are equidistant from each other the Savitzky – Golay convolution method may be used .
The best convolution function to use depends primarily on the signal-to-noise-ratio of the data .
The first derivative ( slope , formula _ 8 ) of all single line shapes is zero at the position of maximum height .
This is also true of the third derivative ; odd derivatives can be used to locate the position of a peak maximum . The second derivatives , formula _ 9 , of both Gaussian and Lorentzian functions have a reduced half-width .
This can be used to apparently improve spectral resolution .
The diagram shows the second derivative of the black curve in the diagram above it .
Whereas the smaller component produces a shoulder in the spectrum , it appears as a separate peak in the 2nd .
derivative .
Fourth derivatives , formula _ 10 , can also be used , when the signal-to-noise-ratio in the spectrum is sufficiently high . Deconvolution can be used to apparently improve spectral resolution .
In the case of NMR spectra , the process is relatively straight forward , because the line shapes are Lorentzian , and the convolution of a Lorentzian with another Lorentzian is also Lorentzian .
The Fourier transform of a Lorentzian is an exponential .
In the co-domain ( time ) of the spectroscopic domain ( frequency ) convolution becomes multiplication .
Therefore , a convolution of the sum of two Lorentzians becomes a multiplication of two exponentials in the co-domain .
Since , in FT-NMR , the measurements are made in the time domain division of the data by an exponential is equivalent to deconvolution in the frequency domain .
A suitable choice of exponential results in a reduction of the half-width of a line in the frequency domain .
This technique has been rendered all but obsolete by advances in NMR technology .
A similar process has been applied for resolution enhancement of other types of spectra , with the disadvantage that the spectrum must be first Fourier transformed and then transformed back after the deconvoluting function has been applied in the spectrum &amp; apos ; s co-domain .

Entpannungspanzer 65The Entpannungspanzer 65 ( EntpPz 65 ) is a Swiss armored recovery vehicle developed by &amp; quot ; Eidgenoessische Konstruktionswerkstaette Thun &amp; quot ; in the late 1960s .
The vehicle served as a traveling workshop for the Swiss military . The prototype for the Entpannungspanzer 65 utilized the chassis system of another army vehicle called the Panzer 61 .
After successful testing , the government received approval for the production of sixty-nine ( 69 ) Entpanungspanzers . In 1961 , the Federal Construction Workshop of Thun , Switzerland began development of a recovery vehicle based on the chassis of the Panzer 61 tank .
The prototype was completed and approved after extensive testing with the chassis of the successor , ( the only slightly modified ) Panzer 68 .
With this form , the vehicle went into series production in 1970 .
The structure was reinforced with a box-shaped cabin .
Numerous storage compartments were assembled on the sides to accommodate tooling , such as cutting torches .
The motor and gear units were positioned in the rear of the vehicle , above the motor cover ; and the series featured an open back with storage boxes to accommodate a spare engine .
The driver sat in the front right of the vehicle , surrounded by three angled mirrors .
A rotating dome with multiple-angle mirrors was positioned behind the driver .
There were four Nebelwerfers ( Smoke Mortars ) behind the driver .
There was also a rotary coupling with a number of angle mirrors , and a hatch mounted on a pivot mount MG 51 . The entry and exit hatch was on the left side of the battle space above the height of the chain guide roller and the first roller .
At the front of the vehicle is a hydraulically operated dozer blade attached crane-like and winch-like operations .
It also was capable of removing obstacles , for preparing positions and the filling of trenches . At the rear of the tank , a tow rope was attached on top of the sidepod tow bars ( A-frame drawbar ) attached .
The vehicle had an NBC protection system .
The maximum tensile load of the main winch was 25 tons , which could be increased with double deflection in the triple train to 75 tons .
The cable length was 120 m .
The auxiliary winch had 240 feet of rope length .
The crane consists of an A-shaped frame , which is mounted on the front of the vehicle and stored when not in use in the rear of the structure .
The corresponding winch was located behind the crew compartment .
The crane at the time of its creation had a lifting capacity of 15 tons at a three meter radius .
The lift height was 4 . 8 m .
The crew consisted of commander , driver , observer and two tank mechanics . It entered service in 1972 with 69 vehicles for the Swiss Army .
Between 1993 and 1995 , all vehicles were updated to the status Entpannungspanzer 65 / 88 and remained with the M numbers M78631-M78699 until 2008 in the service of the Swiss Army . The prototype with the M number M0870 is in the Thun Tank Museum and a serial version is in the Military Museum Full . The Entpannungspanzer 65 has a semi-automatic powershift transmission with six forward and reverse gears .
The steering is via pedals and by hydrostatic superimposed steering system including local steering .
A four-cylinder auxiliary motor ( 38 HP ) is used to drive the hydraulic pump and the main generator .
If necessary , it can be used to drive the drive transmission or start the main motor . The communication board with wireless device is a SE 412 model .
In the crew cabin a NBC protection system and a water tank with 18-liter capacity is installed .

Calculus of conceptsThe calculus of concepts is an abstract language and theory , which was developed to simplify the reasons behind effective messaging when delivered to a specific target or set of targets .
The theory aims to maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes , by using messaging elements and techniques while analyzing the delivery mechanisms in certain scenarios .
The reduction of uncertainty , but not its elimination , is often cost effective and practical . Empowered by the internet of things ( IoT ) the framework looks at numerous device such as smart phones , tablets , laptops , hand held gaming devices , GPS devices , automobile Event Data Recorders and other electronic devices as remote sensors capable of providing data channels . By using elements , the theory discovers underlying key concepts and their relations to better understand how messages can by used to elicit desired behaviors through mental model heuristics and biases .
The framework does not serve up spam to potential consumers ; it is a new paradigm for effective messaging .
The nature of the data produced and consumed by devices in the IoT naturally lends itself to location-based awareness . Just-in-time and real-time broadcasting of key messages gives the framework an extra dimension , putting it at the forefront of behavioral methodologies .
Broadcasting can take place across a number of platforms , text , photographic , video , audio or even direct human contact . The use of anchoring-and-adjustment , framing and representativeness heuristics provides fertile grounds for “ re-wiring ” the decision making processes to include either positive or mitigating mental models of a given concept or set of related concepts .
The “ re-wiring ” will often produce results that have a significant impact on later decisions and behaviors on the target audience .
The framework analyses key factors that influence the effectiveness of messaging mechanisms and how differing approaches can lead to entirely different results . The calculus of concepts framework has been practically implemented utilizing a combination of Naive Bayes classification and Support Vector Machines ( SVM ) algorithms to actively identify the key components of a messaging campaign and its effectiveness .
The effectiveness of a communications campaign is often measured by numerous results including reach , frequency and duration . The training data set for the model implementation utilized the potential messages and delivery mechanisms with Actors , Actions , Objects , Contexts and Indicia as a few examples . Each concept within the framework is treated by the practical implementation as either an independent or dependent variable ( as applicable ) and therefore may have a meaningful effect on the outcome of any communication .
As with any machine-learning tool the Calculus of Concepts model implementation inputs can be either nominal or ordinal and depending on the particular case . Between 2005 and 2012 one of the largest oil companies in China attempted to buy the twelfth biggest oil company in Canada .
Initial proposals and takeover plans were rejected due to a number of issues surrounding political tensions . Stakeholders identified Environment , Context , Domain , Event , Condition , State , Decision , Relation , Actor , Action and Object concepts that needed to be in place to have the key decision makers utilizing the mental models needed to secure the takeover . Over the next 7 years messaging activities were fielded by the Chinese company and its authorized agents , specifically designed to elicit Ideations and Decisions that would result in the takeover going through .
In 2012 , the takeover was completed after a coordinated and concerted field messaging activity .

Feminist technoscienceFeminist technoscience is a transdisciplinary branch of science studies which emerged from decades of feminist critique on the way gender and other identity markers are entangled in the combined fields of science and technology .
The term technoscience , especially in regard to the field of feminist technoscience studies seeks to remove the distinction between scientific research and development with applied applications of technology while assuming science is entwined with the common interests of society .
As a result , science is suggested to be held to the same level of political and ethical accountability as the technologies which develop from it .
Feminist technoscience studies continue to develop new theories on how politics of gender and other identity markers are interconnected to resulting processes of technical change , and power relations of the globalized , material world . Feminist technoscience focuses less on intrapersonal relationships between men and women , and more on broader issues concerning knowledge production and how bodies manifest and are acknowledged in societies . Feminist technoscience studies are inspired by social constructionist approaches to gender , sex , intersectionalities , and science , technology and society ( STS ) .
It can also be referred to as feminist science studies , feminist STS , feminist cultural studies of science , feminist studies of science and technology , and gender and science . According to Judy Wajcman , the concept of technology has historically been bound to indigenous women .
The roles of harvesters , or caretakers of the domestic economy taken up by these women lead Wajcman to conclude they would have created tools such as the sickle and the pestle , making them the first technologists .
During the Eighteenth century , industrial engineering began to constitute the modern definition of technology .
This transformed the meaning from including useful arts technology – such as needlework , metalwork , weaving , and mining – to strictly applied science .
As a result , &amp; quot ; male machines &amp; quot ; replaced the &amp; quot ; female fabrics &amp; quot ; as identifiers of modern technology when engineering was considered as masculine profession .
Due to political movements of the 1960s and early 70s , science and technology were considered for a profit industrial , governmental , or militaristic based practice , and associated with masculinity resulting in a lack of feminist discourse .
Feminist scholarship identified the absence of women &amp; apos ; s presence in technological and scientific spheres , due the use of sex stereotyping in education and sexual discrimination in the workforce , as well as the development of technology as a masculine construct .
Examples of masculine-coded technologies under these categories included ARPANET , a precursor to the internet developed by the United States Department of Defence , and the Manhattan Project . The women &amp; apos ; s health movements of the 1970s US and UK provided momentum to the emergence of feminist politics around scientific knowledge .
During the early states of second-wave feminism , campaigns for improved birth control and abortion rights were at the forefront in challenging the consolidation of male dominated sciences and technologies at the expense of women &amp; apos ; s health .
The act of regaining knowledge and control over women &amp; apos ; s bodies was seen as a crucial component to women &amp; apos ; s liberation . Science was originally seen as an alien entity opposed to women &amp; apos ; s interests .
Sciences and technologies developed under the misconception that women &amp; apos ; s needs were universal and inferior to the needs of men , forcing women into rigid , determined sex roles .
A shift happened in the 1980s – Sandra Harding proposed &amp; quot ; the female question in science &amp; quot ; to raise &amp; quot ; the question of the science in feminism &amp; quot ; , claiming that science is involved in projects that are not only neutral and objective , but that are strongly linked to male interests .
The conceptualization of science and technology was expanded to reflect the all-pervasive ways in which technology is encountered in daily life , gaining attention of feminists out of concern for female positions in science and technological professions .
Rather than asking how women can be better treated within and by science , feminist critics instead chose to focus on how a science deeply involved in masculinity and masculine projects could be used for the emancipation of women . Today &amp; apos ; s feminist critique often uses the former demonology of technology as a point of departure to tell a story of progress from liberal to postmodern feminism .
According to Judy Wajcman , both liberal and Marxist feminists failed in the analysis of science and technology , because they considered the technology as neutral and did not pay attention to the symbolic dimension of technoscience . Feminist technoscience studies have become intrinsically linked with practices of Technofeminism and the development of feminist technologies in cultural and critical vernacular .
Feminist technoscience studies explore the coded social and historical implications of science and technology on the development of society , including how identity constructs and is constructed by these technologies .
Technofeminism emerged in the early 1980s , leaning on the different feminist movements .
Feminist scholars reanalyzed the Scientific Revolution , and stated that the resulting science was based on the masculine ideology of exploiting the Earth and control .
During this time , nature and scientific inquiry were modelled after misogynous relationships to women .
Femininity was associated with nature and considered as something passive to be objectified .
This was in contrast to culture , which was represented by objectifying masculinity .
This analysis depended on the use of gender imagery to conceptualize the nature of technoscientific masculine ideology . Judy Wajcman draws parallels between Judith Butler &amp; apos ; s theory of gender performativity and the construction of technology .
Butler conceives gender as a performative act as opposed to a naturalized condition one is born into .
Through a fluctuating process achieved in daily social interaction , gender identity is acted and constructed through relational behaviours – it is a fluid concept .
Drawing from the work of Butler and Donna Haraway , Amade M &amp; apos ; charek analyzes how objects , when linked to another object or signifier , construct identity through the use of human imagination : Differences and similarities may be stable or not , depending on the maintenance work that goes into the relations that help to produce them .
They are neither fundaments nor qualities that are always embodied … Differences are relational .
They do not always materialize in bodies ( in the flesh , genes , hormones , brains , or the skin ) .
Rather they materialize in the very relations that help to enact them .
In this theory , identity is not the byproduct of genes , but the constant upholding of hierarchical difference relations .
Differences in identity are the effect of interferences , performing and enacting and being enacted upon .
Technology too , as proposed by Wajcman , is a product of mutual alliances , not objectively given but collectively created in a process of reiteration .
To this end , technology exists as both a source and a concurrence of identity relations . Western technology and science is deeply implicated in the masculine projection and patriarchal domination of women and nature .
After the shift of feminist theory to focus more on technoscience , there was a call for new technology to be based on the needs and values of women , rather than masculine dominated technological development .
The differences between female and male needs were asserted by feminist movements , drawing attention to the exclusion of women being served by current technologies .
Reproductive technologies in particular were influenced by this movement .
During this time , household technologies , new media , and new technosciences were , for the most part , disregarded . Feminist technologies are ones that are formed from feminist social relations , but varied definitions and layers of feminism complicate the definition .
Deborah Johnson proposes four candidates for feminist technologies : The successes of certain technologies , such as the pap smear for cervical cancer testing , relied on the feminization of technician jobs .
The intervention of women outside the technological sphere , like from members of the women &amp; apos ; s health movement , and public health activists also aided in the tool &amp; apos ; s development .
However , other feminist technologies , such as birth control serve as an example of a feminist technology also shaped in part by dominant masculinity . Combined oral contraceptive pills were first approved for use in the United States in 1960 , during the time of the women &amp; apos ; s liberation movement .
The birth control pill helped make it possible for more women to enter the workforce by giving them the ability to control her own fertility .
Decades prior to this , activists such as Margaret Sanger and Katharine McCormick fought for female contraceptives , seeing it as a necessity for the emancipation of women .
However , in the 1970s feminists raised critique on male control of the medical and pharmaceutical industry .
The male domination of these fields led technologies such as oral contraceptives to be developed around what men considered to be universal , defining characteristics of women ( these being their sex and reproductive capabilities ) .
Birth control pills themselves also succeeded in perpetrating and creating this universality – shaped by moral considerations of the natural body , the length of the menstrual cycle was able to be engineered . The development of reproductive technologies blur the lines between nature and technology , allowing for the reconfiguration of life itself .
Through the advances of genetic technologies , the controlling of pregnancy , childbirth , and motherhood has become increasingly possible through intrusive means .
These advances in biotechnology are serving to develop life as a commodity and deepen monetary inequality - a link made by feminist theorists such as Donna Haraway .
Genetic engineering also brings about questions in eugenics , leading to early radical feminist analysis to declare and attempt to reclaim motherhood as a foundation of female identity .
The idea of a green , natural motherhood was popularized by eco feminists who celebrated the identification of women with nature , and natural life . Haraway instead chooses to embrace technology as feminist instead of reverting to this idea of naturalized femininity .
By embracing the image of the cyborg , an amalgamation that is neither human / animal nor machine , Haraway explores the ideas of technoscience and gender , conceptualizing a space where gender is an arbitrary , unnecessary construct . The corporatization of biology through the alteration of nature through technology is also a theme explored by Haraway .
The OncoMouse is a laboratory mouse genetically modified to carry a specific gene which increases the creature &amp; apos ; s chance of developing cancer .
Until 2005 , American conglomerate DuPoint owned the patent to the OncoMouse , reconfiguring and relegating life to a commodity .
This development in genetic engineering brings up questions about lab animal treatment , as well as ethical questions around class and race .
Increasing breast cancer rates in Black women are discussed in eco-feminist analysis of the modification of lab animals from breast cancer research to being the discussion into an ethically ambiguous space .
Haraway in particular raises the question of whether modifying and expending a live commodity like OncoMouse is ethical if it leads to the development of a cure for breast cancer . The reconfiguring of life in biotechnologies and genetic engineering allow for a precedence to be set , leading to capitalist cultural consequences .
Through these technologies technoscience becomes naturalized , and also becomes increasingly subject to the process of commodification and capital accumulation in transnational capitalist corporations .
Like presented in Marxist and Neo-Marxist analysis of sciences , biotechnologies allow for the concept of commodity to become fetishized as genes are reified to have a monetary value outside nature .
This also develops life and nature as a thing to be exploited by capitalism .

Satyagraha HouseSatyagraha House , commonly known as Gandhi House , is a museum and guest house located in Johannesburg .
The house belonged to Mahatma Gandhi : he lived and worked there between 1908 and 1909 .
It is registered as part of Johannesburg &amp; apos ; s historical heritage .
Satyagraha means insistence on truth .
The house was designed by the architect Hermann Kallenbach for Gandhi and himself . Gandhi spent 21 years in South Africa , from 1893 until 1914 , although he made visits to India and the UK during that time .
It is said that Gandhi first learnt about racial discrimination when he was arrested at Pietermaritzburg railway station for travelling in a whites only wagon .
In 1904 , Gandhi met Hermann Kallenbach , a German-Jewish architect who had arrived in the country in 1896 .
In 1907 , Kallenbach designed a house that was based on the shape of two local huts ( rondavels ) but made with European building methods .
It was named the Kraal , which means barn in English and Afrikaans .
The house had stables and a tennis court , but both of them led a life of meditation and chastity .
Gandhi slept in an attic room which he entered via a ladder , but he and Kallenbach shared the same kitchen and entertained their guests in the living room .
The houses did not have connecting doors , and it was necessary to leave one house in order to enter the other .
Kallenbach &amp; apos ; s life was transformed by their life together and the money that he spent on himself was cut to a tenth of its initial figure .
They left in 1909 , and the house had several owners before being bought in 2009 by the French travel company Voyageurs du Monde to the chagrin of the Government of India who wanted to acquire it as an Indian national monument .
The French company had it restored and opened it to the public as a museum and guest house in 2011 . The museum is managed by Lauren Segal , who also manages other museums , including the Apartheid Museum .
Satyagraha means &amp; quot ; truth force &amp; quot ; , a reference to the concept of non-violent resistance developed by Gandhi when he lived in South Africa .
Mailiao Power PlantThe Mailiao Power Plant ( ) is a coal-fired power plant in Mailiao Township , Yunlin County , Taiwan .
With a total installed capacity of 4,200 MW , the plant is Taiwan &amp; apos ; s third largest coal-fired power plant after Taichung Power Plant and Hsinta Power Plant . The groundbreaking ceremony for the power plant construction was held on 12 December 1996 .
Invited to the ceremony were Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh , Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang and President of Legislative Yuan Liu Sung-pan . Commissioned in June 1999 for its first two units , the power plant is the first independent power producer power plant after Taipower ended the electricity supply monopoly in Taiwan in 1994 . The power plant is owned by the Mai-Liao Power Corporation ( MPC ) and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation ( FPCC ) . The power plant consists of five 600 MW pulverized coal-fired units owned by the MPC and two 600 MW pulverized coal-fired co-generation units owned by the FPCC .
The plant is designed for base load service with the capability for daily startup and shutdown operation per instructions from Taipower &amp; apos ; s dispatcher center . The coal handling system of the power plant has a truck unloading station capacity of 600 tonnes / hour and its flexible sidewall conveyor capacity of 800 tonnes / hour .
The coal is stored in coal domes in which each dome is 120 meter in diameter , 60 meter in height and 180,000 tons in capacity . On 20 June 2012 at 11 : 55 am , the power plant tripped during the Tropical Storm Talim .
This caused the shut down of 54 out of 66 units of the Yunlin petrochemical complex . On 1 August 2016 , a generating unit of the power plant broke down , disrupting the supply of power . On 7 October 2017 , the no .
1 generation unit of the power plant was shut down due to pipe rupture , causing 600 MW of power loss .

Gisborne City Vintage RailwayThe Gisborne City Vintage Railway Incorporated is a railway preservation group based in Gisborne , New Zealand .
Operating on part of the northern section of the mothballed Palmerston North – Gisborne Line , the group was founded in 1985 . From 1986 , group restored Wa 165 , the first locomotive built at NZR &amp; apos ; s Hillside Workshops in 1897 .
The locomotive was returned to steam in 2000 .
The group then began running excursions from Gisborne . In 2012 KiwiRail announced that it was mothballing the Napier-Gisborne section of the Palmerston North-Gisborne Line , due to the cost of repairing storm damage to the line .
This put the future of Gisborne City Vintage Railway in question .
In 2013 the group &amp; apos ; s president , Geoff Joyce , told the Gisborne District Council that the group was preparing a business case to take over the lease of the line from KiwiRail .
The plan includes leasing 34 km of track from Gisborne to Beach Loop .

Kind ConsumerKind Consumer Limited is a UK-based healthcare company which focuses on developing novel inhalation technologies to address tobacco harm reduction .
The company was founded in 2006 by Alex Hearn , a British inventor and entrepreneur based in LondonThe development rationale of inhaler technology is to provide a novel format of nicotine delivery which offers smokers a more acceptable alternative to the tobacco cigarette to help them cut down , substitute and quit - a concept known as tobacco harm reduction . The health burden of tobacco usage and in particular tobacco smoking is very well known .
Tobacco smoking is a major global health epidemic with an estimated 1 . 3 billion individuals regularly smoking tobacco products across the world , predominantly cigarettes .
It is well established that the key pharmacological element of tobacco addiction is the delivery of nicotine to the brain , leading to the release of a range of neurotransmitters such as dopamine which yield powerful feelings of “ reward ” and “ pleasure ” to the individual .
The tobacco cigarette is a highly efficient nicotine delivery system that achieves rapid pulmonary delivery and sharp increases in the nicotine concentration in both arterial and venous blood .
Although nicotine is the predominant addictive chemical in tobacco smoke , it is the other ( approximately 4000 ) chemicals , including carcinogenic agents in the particulate phase , that lead to the well-established adverse health consequences of smoking .
The World Health Organisation estimates that tobacco usage killed around 5 . 4 million people a year and by 2030 projections estimate this figure will rise to around 8 . 3 million deaths per year . It has been argued that long-term success rates of existing NRT in smoking cessation remain low , with a recent study showing that only 6 . 75 % of smokers receiving NRT therapy attained sustained abstinence for six months , albeit twice the rate of placebo treatment . As an explanation for these findings it has been argued that the major limitation with delivery of nicotine by current nicotine replacement therapy products is that they do not provide smokers with the combination of a rapid delivery of nicotine and the unique respiratory tract sensory cues of inhaled nicotine ( particularly upper airway irritation ) which together are of primary importance in relieving craving for cigarettes .
The nicotine nasal spray does achieve rapid delivery of nicotine but lacks the inhalational cues of cigarettes and has demonstrated limited acceptability due to the local irritant effects of nicotine on the nasal mucosa .
The nicotine vapour Inhaler , although simulating the behavioural aspects of smoking and presenting some sensory cues , delivers nicotine very much slower than a cigarette . Kind Consumer &amp; apos ; s inhaler technology “ Voke ” was designed to provide the combination of a rapid delivery of nicotine and the unique respiratory tract sensory cues of inhaled nicotine which together are of primary importance in relieving craving for nicotine .
The idea took 13 years to develop and was the brainchild of Alex Hearn , an asthmatic Oxford graduate whose parents smoked and who went through more than 800 prototypes before settling on a design . The Voke Inhaler contains a micro-valve which is activated by the user inhaling , and unlike an e-cigarette , does not need electronics , batteries or heat to produce a hit of nicotine .
Since it uses inhaler technology to deliver the nicotine , the Voke administers a precise dose of the drug which does not contain the tar , tobacco or other substances found in regular cigarettes . In late 2010 , Kind Consumer agreed an exclusive development and distribution agreement with Nicoventures Limited ( later renamed Nicovations Limited ) a wholly owned subsidiary of British American Tobacco plc . In September 2014 , Voke became the first simulated cigarette to be authorised by the UK &amp; apos ; s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) as a nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) .
The device is seen as a competitor to both e-cigarettes and nicotine-replacement therapies , such as gum and patches , as well as Johnson &amp; amp ; Johnson &amp; apos ; s existing Nicorette Inhalator , which is not designed as an imitation cigarette . In January 2017 following a number of postponed and aborted launch schedules due to manufacturing failures , the development and distribution agreement with Nicovations Limited was terminated by mutual agreement with all intellectual property , manufacturing , marketing and branding rights awarded to Kind Consumer .
As of 2017 , the information is not available yet for when the product will be launched . As a medicinal product , Voke can be prescribed by doctors as a safer alternative to smoking .
It is also on the General Sales List and will also be available to buy over the counter . Voke is used to relieve and / or prevent cravings and nicotine withdrawal symptoms associated with tobacco dependence .
It is indicated to aid smokers wishing to quit or reduce prior to quitting , to assist smokers who are unwilling or unable to smoke , and as a safer alternative to smoking for smokers and those around them .
More details can be found in the product ’ s Public Assessment Report ( PAR ) on the UK ’ s MHRA . Kind Consumer has attracted investment from a large British investment trust and a number of notable high-profile angel investors :
The Last Five Years ( film ) The Last Five Years is a 2014 American musical romantic comedy-drama film starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan .
Based on Jason Robert Brown &amp; apos ; s musical of the same name , the film is written and directed by Richard Lagravenese . The film premiered on September 7 , 2014 , in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival .
The film was released in select theaters and on video on demand on February 13 , 2015 . The musical chronicles the romance between Jamie Wellerstein ( Jordan ) and Cathy Hiatt ( Kendrick ) .
It presents their relationship out of chronological order , in a non-linear narrative : Cathy &amp; apos ; s songs begin after they have separated and move backwards in time to the beginning of their courtship , while Jamie &amp; apos ; s songs start when they have first met and proceeds through their crumbling marriage . The musical , as presented on stage , is a two-person show , with no other actors besides the ones playing Jamie and Cathy .
Additionally , it consists almost exclusively of solo numbers ; Jamie and Cathy alternate songs , do not share the other &amp; apos ; s time frame , almost never sing together and frequently are not even present while the other character unburdens themselves .
This gives each character space to present their side of the story , biases and all .
In adapting for film , LaGravanese made the decision to have the other character present for each monologue , but no music was altered .
Additionally , a number of other actors appear in other parts , though Jordan and Kendrick still provide the bulk of the dialogue and all singing . Cathy sits alone with a letter from her husband Jamie declaring their marriage over ( &amp; quot ; Still Hurting &amp; quot ; ) .
She removes her wedding rings , as well as her wristwatch and bracelet . Five years earlier , Jamie is an up-and-coming Jewish writer who has just met Cathy .
He is overjoyed to be dating outside his Jewish heritage ( &amp; quot ; Shiksa Goddess &amp; quot ; ) , and declares , &amp; quot ; I could be in love with someone like you . &amp; quot ; Summer 2013 : Cathy and Jamie are in Ohio , where she is working in summer stock .
It is her birthday , and he has come to visit her .
She is anxious to fix any problems in their marriage but she becomes angry when Jamie tells her he has to go back early to New York .
She accuses him of egotism , of caring only about himself , and of being unwilling to spend time with her ( &amp; quot ; See I &amp; apos ; m Smiling &amp; quot ; ) . Jamie receives a phone call that ultimately leads to a book deal with Random House Publishing Group .
He calls Cathy and agrees to move in with her .
He comments on how lucky he feels that he is getting a book published at age 23 and that he is in a relationship with Cathy ( &amp; quot ; Moving Too Fast &amp; quot ; ) .
Elsewhere at an audition , Cathy makes a call to her disinterested agent : it seems her career isn &amp; apos ; t going the way she planned , as she does not move on to the dance audition . In late 2009 and early 2010 , Cathy attends multiple social functions for the promotion of Jamie &amp; apos ; s novel and for celebrating its success ( 63 weeks as a bestseller ) .
She sings about how his newfound fame and success in writing have changed their lives and jokes about how focused or &amp; quot ; catatonic &amp; quot ; he becomes in his writing process .
She expresses that she feels the best way to love Jamie is to focus on him and his growing career .
She chooses to &amp; quot ; follow in his stride &amp; quot ; and put herself and her dreams second to his new success .
But she believes this sacrifice is the best way to support and love Jamie ( &amp; quot ; A Part of That &amp; quot ; ) . After a horrible day working as a bartender , Cathy comes home to an excited Jamie .
He tells her a new story he has written about an old tailor named Schmuel , who had given up on his dreams but is able to turn back time , and right past wrongs with the help of a magical clock .
The story is complete with dancing and decorating the house and Cathy with Christmas decorations .
After the story Jamie compares Cathy to Schmuel and encourages her to take more risks and continue to pursue her own dreams .
For her Christmas present , Jamie gives her an appointment for new headshots , a Backstage magazine , and a wristwatch , as well as the promise to support her as she pursues acting ( &amp; quot ; The Schmuel Song &amp; quot ; ) . In summer of 2010 , Cathy is in Ohio doing summer stock and video chatting with Jamie who is still in New York .
She describes to Jamie her disappointing life in Ohio , her dysfunctional and eccentric colleagues , and her desires to be back in New York and to never return to Ohio ( &amp; quot ; A Summer in Ohio &amp; quot ; ) .
At the end of this song it is revealed that she and Jamie are married . Jamie and Cathy walk to a gazebo in Central Park , sharing a conversation , though , at first , the audience only hears Jamie &amp; apos ; s side .
Jamie proposes to her , Cathy eventually says yes , and they are then shown getting married in same location ( &amp; quot ; The Next Ten Minutes &amp; quot ; ) .
It is the only point in the film when the characters sing a duet and are in the same time and place .
Afterwards , Cathy &amp; apos ; s side of the conversation at the gazebo is heard , as Cathy &amp; apos ; s timeline continues to moves towards the beginning of their relationship . Jamie is facing and resisting temptation and advances from other women , especially now his fame as a writer has escalated ( 33 weeks as a bestseller ) .
He expresses his desires to remain faithful to Cathy , and continues to try and resist ( &amp; quot ; A Miracle Would Happen &amp; quot ; ) .
Cathy , meanwhile , is auditioning for an off-Broadway role in New York ( &amp; quot ; When You Come Home to Me &amp; quot ; ) .
The audition goes well and she calls Jamie about her hopes for landing the role and not returning to Ohio for another summer .
Another Christmas passes and Jamie gives Cathy a gold bracelet .
Cathy is back at the summer theater in Ohio for the summer of 2011 and receives a text from Jamie about his coming to see her . Cathy is shown unsuccessfully auditioning and calls Jamie to talk about her rejection and the fierce competition she has at these auditions .
We next see Cathy attending a book reading for Jamie &amp; apos ; s book &amp; quot ; Light out of Darkness . &amp; quot ; At this event Cathy realizes that she does not want to be a suburban housewife or a &amp; quot ; girl who requires a man to get by &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; Climbing Uphill &amp; quot ; ) . Jamie and Cathy are having a bitter fight .
Jamie wants Cathy to attend a party to celebrate the publishing of his book .
She states she has been to so many of them only to be neglected and ignored by her husband .
He decides he &amp; apos ; ll go but questions Cathy about why she really refuses to go with him .
He suggests that the lack of success in acting ( and having to go back to Ohio ) is the reason .
He says that he believes in her and that they would not be together if he didn &amp; apos ; t .
He asks her to be supportive of him and the fact that he &amp; apos ; s living out his dream .
He accuses her of being unsupportive of his career just because hers is failing ( &amp; quot ; If I Didn &amp; apos ; t Believe in You &amp; quot ; ) .
Cathy ultimately refuses to go with Jamie . An unmarried Cathy is in the car with Jamie , who is going to meet her parents .
She tells him about her past relationships and hopes not to end up in a small town life like her friend from high school and her parents ( &amp; quot ; I Can Do Better Than That &amp; quot ; ) .
Upon arriving to her parents &amp; apos ; house , she asks Jamie to move in with her . Near the end of the relationship , Jamie wakes up in his apartment beside multiple women , including his editor , Alise , and the receptionist at Random House ( &amp; quot ; Nobody Needs to Know &amp; quot ; ) .
About to leave for Ohio to visit Cathy , he tries to defend his actions and blames Cathy for destroying his privacy and their relationship .
Jamie promises not to lie to Alise and tells her , &amp; quot ; I could be in love with someone like you , &amp; quot ; just as he did to Cathy . Cathy is ecstatic after her first date with Jamie ( &amp; quot ; Goodbye Until Tomorrow &amp; quot ; ) .
She proclaims that she has been waiting for Jamie her whole life .
Simultaneously but five years after their first date , Jamie sits in their apartment writing a farewell letter to Cathy about how hard he tried to save her and their marriage and he couldn &amp; apos ; t find a way for them both to be happy ( &amp; quot ; I Could Never Rescue You &amp; quot ; ) . As a hopeful Cathy waits for a tomorrow with Jamie , a discouraged Jamie tells Cathy &amp; quot ; goodbye &amp; quot ; .
He leaves behind his keys and wedding ring and then exits their apartment .
Later that evening , we see Cathy return to the apartment and open the front door , which relates us back to the opening scene of the film .
As Cathy closes the door , the film cuts to black . The film &amp; apos ; s song numbers follows the musical &amp; apos ; s , alternating between Cathy and Jamie with a song or two sung by both . Principal photography began on June 17 , 2013 in New York City .
The film wrapped on July 16 , 2013 in Harlem .
It inked foreign distribution deals with countries in Eastern Europe and Asia in August 2014 . Betsy Wolfe , who played Cathy in the 2013 Off-Broadway revival , plays the former stripper that Cathy rooms with in Ohio .
Composer Brown plays one of the accompanists during Cathy &amp; apos ; s auditions in &amp; quot ; Climbing Uphill &amp; quot ; .
Sherie Rene Scott , who originated the role of Cathy in the Off-Broadway production , also appears in one of the audition scenes with her husband Kurt Deutsch . Radius-TWC announced a release date in the United States of February 13 , 2015 , simultaneously releasing it in select theatres and on VOD .
It was previously set for release in the United Kingdom on December 12 , 2014 , but was later pushed back to February 6 , in line with its US release .

Jeremy Jordan &amp; apos ; s performance was met with positive reviews .
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 59 % approval rating , based on 84 reviews , with an average rating of 6 . 2 / 10 .
The site &amp; apos ; s critical consensus states , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; The Last Five Years &amp; quot ; hits a few awkward notes in its transition from stage to screen , but its freshness and sincere charm – and well-matched stars – offer their own rewards . &amp; quot ; Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average score , calculated an average score of 60 out of 100 , based on 28 critics , indicating &amp; quot ; mixed or average reviews &amp; quot ; . In &amp; quot ; The Observer &amp; quot ; , Jonathan Romney found the film to be &amp; quot ; an enjoyable anomaly .
&amp; quot ; The Last Five Years &amp; quot ; is not just a romcom for people who hate romcoms , it ’ s also a musical – although people who devoutly hate those may not click with its literate wit and knowing , more-bitter-than-sweet poignancy &amp; quot ; .
Less positively , he wrote : &amp; quot ; It ’ s not as cinematically confident as it might be : director Richard LaGravenese isn &amp; apos ; t always the most imaginative at providing visual settings &amp; quot ; , before adding , &amp; quot ; this does feel like an organic film rather than a show forced into movie glad rags &amp; quot ; .
Romney found the songs to be &amp; quot ; unfailingly sharp , though one or two take on clunky rock colourings ; even then , they ’ re only as bad as , say , Billy Joel on one of his better days &amp; quot ; .
He concluded , &amp; quot ; It ’ s a film to bring tears to the eyes of a cynic – in fact , a cynic might relish it more than anyone , since it ’ s the counterpointing of exuberance with unashamed bleakness that makes &amp; quot ; The Last Five Years &amp; quot ; so rich .
You may even , just possibly , come out humming the tunes . &amp; quot ;

The VoicesThe Voices is a 2014 black comedy horror film .
Directed by Marjane Satrapi and written by Michael R .
Perry , the film stars Ryan Reynolds , Gemma Arterton , Anna Kendrick and Jacki Weaver .
It had its world premiere at 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 19 , 2014 .
The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on February 6 , 2015 , by Lionsgate .
It received positive reviews from critics . Jerry ( Ryan Reynolds ) is an upbeat man who works at a bathtub factory , and lives in a modified apartment above a bowling alley with his dog , Bosco , and his cat , Mr .
Whiskers .
Jerry is a schizophrenic who chooses not to take his medication and enjoys delusions and hallucinations that manifest in the form of his pets talking to him .
Bosco often represents his good intentions while Mr .
Whiskers represents his more violent nature .
One day , his manager compliments his hard work and chooses him to help organize an employee barbecue , and he gladly accepts the opportunity to work with his workplace crush , an English woman named Fiona .
The following day he asks her out on a date .
She initially agrees , though with reluctance , but then stands him up to go to a karaoke party with two other women who work with her in the accounting department at work , Lisa and Alison .
After the party , Fiona &amp; apos ; s car won &amp; apos ; t start , leading her to flag down Jerry as he drives by .
Fiona offers to take him out for a late dinner to make up for standing him up on the original date , but on the way , Jerry accidentally hits a deer which crashes through his windshield .
Jerry &amp; apos ; s hallucinations show the deer crying out in pain and begging Jerry to kill it so he slits the deer &amp; apos ; s throat .
Fiona , terrified , runs off into the woods .
Jerry pursues her and stabs her to death .
Upon returning home , Bosco suggests he has to go to the police and confess , encouraging him in saying that he &amp; apos ; s a good man and won &amp; apos ; t be punished .
On the other hand , Mr .
Whiskers says there is no shame in killing , but insists Jerry needs to dispose of the body and refrain from going to the police or else he will be severely punished and locked away .
Jerry collects Fiona &amp; apos ; s body from the forest , and returns home with it but leaves a bloody shoe and pile of organs .
He dismembers Fiona , placing her innards in numerous plastic boxes and her disembodied head inside his fridge .
After this traumatic experience , his delusions increase with now having Fiona being able to talk to him .
Her tone suggests she forgives him for his actions , but she insists he takes his medication to end his behavior .
Jerry takes his pills , and experiences nightmares of his abusive past .
When he wakes up during the night , he is groggy , but his hallucinations have ended ; his pets no longer speak to him , his apartment is a complete mess with animal waste littering the floor , garbage piling up in bags and up against the walls of his apartment and blood all over his kitchen after cutting up Fiona &amp; apos ; s body and Fiona &amp; apos ; s head is cold and rotting .
He throws away the pills in terror , and the next morning , his hallucinations resume and his happy life is back to &amp; apos ; normal &amp; apos ; .
Fiona tries to convince Jerry to kill someone else so that she has someone to talk to , but Jerry insists that he can &amp; apos ; t . Jerry asks Lisa on a date .
He develops feelings for her and takes her to his abandoned childhood home , where it is revealed his German mother had confessed to her insanity and was about to be taken away by the authorities when he was a child .
When they arrived , she tried to slit her throat , but couldn &amp; apos ; t do it herself and so she begged Jerry to finish the job to end her suffering .
The police had found Jerry standing over his dead mother with a piece of broken glass and he is committed instead .
Jerry sobs in front of Lisa , who comforts him .
They go back to her house and spend the night together .
When Jerry returns home the next morning , he still feels pressured into killing someone else by Fiona and Mr .
Whiskers , and seems unsure of what to do next . Lisa finds out Jerry &amp; apos ; s address through accounting and delivers a gift to his house .
When Jerry inadvertently locks himself out , he tries to get back in through the sky light , but Lisa manages to pick the door open using her hairpin .
She wanders in and discovers the state of the apartment , as well as the covered head of Fiona , though she doesn &amp; apos ; t immediately recognize it beneath the coat covering it .
Jerry sneaks up on her , upset that she trespassed into his home , but despite pressure from Mr .
Whiskers , he refuses to kill her .
Lisa sees for the first time the troubled , delusional man Jerry is , and , frightened , tries to run away , running to the bathroom to hide , and then into his bedroom .
Jerry comes in , genuinely trying to apologize for scaring Lisa and she , feeling cornered , attempts to put up an act , insisting they can go back to normal and forget what happened in order to make him let her leave , but when she panics and tries to escape hurriedly , Jerry grabs her by the arms to stop her and throws her backwards back onto the bed causing her to break her neck on the headboard .
After she dies , Jerry cuts her body apart and places her head in the fridge , next to Fiona &amp; apos ; s .
Other workers from accounting begin to realize Fiona and Lisa have gone missing .
When Alison goes to Jerry &amp; apos ; s house to ask if he knows where they are , Jerry immediately kills and dismembers her . Jerry confesses his killings to his counselor Dr .
Warren .
She tries to call the police , but he takes her hostage into the countryside and forces her to help him .
She calms him down and shows understanding , which makes him feel better .
Meanwhile , the other workers from accounting break into Jerry &amp; apos ; s home ( as Bosco runs away ) and discover the apartment &amp; apos ; s state as well as all the blood , and immediately retreat to call the police .
Shortly after Jerry returns home , still holding Warren hostage , the police surround his house and prepare to move in .
Jerry takes Mr .
Whiskers into the bathroom and then flees down into the basement , breaking a gas pipe while doing so .
After rescuing Dr .
Warren , the police are knocked back from a huge explosion that was caused by the gas leak . Down in the bowling alley , Jerry realizes the bowling alley is on fire and he is in grave danger .
The voices of Bosco and Mr .
Whiskers , no longer taking forms of belonging to a dog and cat no longer with him , speak to him in his own mind , Mr .
Whiskers is insisting he get out of there and find another place to live , to hide , so that he may continue killing and feeling alive , and Bosco telling him that there is no place for him in life any longer and that he should let the fire &amp; quot ; put him to sleep &amp; quot ; .
Choosing to stay and end his own misery , he lies down and waits until he blacks out from the smoke . In a white void , Bosco and Mr .
Whiskers confess that , despite their opposing beliefs , they did like each other , before going their separate ways .
Jerry then appears with his parents , Fiona , Lisa and Alison , and he apologizes to the women for killing them .
Just then Jesus appears , and they all dance and sing together . Before initial production , the script for the Voices was incredibly praised including being listed on The Black List &amp; apos ; s Best UN-produced Screenplays of 2009 .
The film originally had Mark Romanek attached to direct The Voices back in 2010 with Ben Stiller set to act as Jerry Hickfang , but was never made due to the budget issues .
The project was brought up again in August 2012 , when it was announced that Marjane Satrapi will be directing the black comedy instead .
When asked about casting Ryan Reynolds in the leading role , Satrapi stated in an interview with Digital Spy , &amp; quot ; At the beginning , the producer and myself said let &amp; apos ; s look for an actor , and then Ryan made the voices on his iPhone and he sent it over , and I was like , &amp; quot ; Who is that ? &amp; quot ; And suddenly it makes sense .
That is the voices the guy hears , so who else but him can do it ? It can only be him , so , yeah , it was an obvious choice . &amp; quot ; Principal photography began in April 2013 in Berlin , Germany . The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19 , 2014 .
on March 5 , 2014 , it was announced Lionsgate had acquired distribution rights to the film .
The film screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11 , 2014 .
The film was then released on video on demand and in limited release on February 6 , 2015 .
In the film &amp; apos ; s opening weekend the film made $ 5,000 . &amp; quot ; The Voices &amp; quot ; received generally positive reviews .
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 74 % based on 85 reviews , with an average rating of 6 . 6 / 10 .
The website &amp; apos ; s critical consensus reads , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; The Voices &amp; quot ; gives Ryan Reynolds an opportunity to deliver a highlight-reel performance — and offers an off-kilter treat for fans of black comedies . &amp; quot ; On Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating , the film has a score 58 out of 100 , based on 24 critics , indicating &amp; quot ; mixed or average reviews &amp; quot ; . Brad Wheeler of Canada &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; The Globe and Mail &amp; quot ; gave the film three out of four stars and stated that , &amp; quot ; Think of this stylish , quirky and quite grisly feature from Marjane Satrapi as a meeting of &amp; quot ; Psycho &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Dexter &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Dr .
Doolittle &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ;
Francis ParaisonFrancis Paraison ( ca .

By this time , almost 70 % of the human population , having divided itself into three factions : ARUS , JIOR and Dorssia , had migrated into space following the creation of Dyson Spheres — massive space habitats capable of sustaining human life .
This segregation created an ongoing conflict between the hostile Dorssian forces which seek to expand their territory and the allied ARUS and neutral JIOR factions .
Subsequently , the JIOR scientists developed a highly advanced weaponized mecha technology called Valvrave which possess enough power to turn the tide of the war .
With each of the hostile factions now desiring this weapon , high schoolers , Haruto Tokishima and his friends pilot the Valvrave mechs and use them to protect their Module 77 home from the Dorssian forces .

Ukraine – European Union Association AgreementThe Ukraine – European Union Association Agreement is a European Union Association Agreement between the European Union ( EU ) , Euratom , Ukraine and the EU &amp; apos ; s 28 member states ( which are separate parties in addition to the EU and Euratom ) .
It establishes a political and economic association between the parties .
The agreement entered into force on September 1 , 2017 , and previously parts had been provisionally applied .
The parties committed to co-operate and converge economic policy , legislation , and regulation across a broad range of areas , including equal rights for workers , steps towards visa-free movement of people , the exchange of information and staff in the area of justice , the modernisation of Ukraine &amp; apos ; s energy infrastructure , and access to the European Investment Bank .
The parties committed to regular summit meetings , and meetings among ministers , other officials , and experts .
The agreement furthermore establishes a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area between the parties . The agreement commits Ukraine to economic , judicial , and financial reforms to converge its policies and legislation to those of the European Union .
Ukraine commits to gradually conform to EU technical and consumer standards .
The EU agrees to provide Ukraine with political and financial support , access to research and knowledge , and preferential access to EU markets .
The agreement commits both parties to promote a gradual convergence toward the EU &amp; apos ; s Common Security and Defence Policy and European Defence Agency policies . The agreement comes after more than two decades in which both parties sought to establish closer ties with each other .
On the one hand , the European Union wants to ensure that its imports of grain and natural gas from Ukraine , as well as its exports of goods to Ukraine , are not threatened by instability in the region , believing that instability could eventually be reduced through sociopolitical and economic reforms in Ukraine .
Ukraine , on the other hand , wants to increase its exports by benefiting from free trade with the European Union while attracting desirable external investments , as well as establishing closer ties with a sociopolitical entity to which many Ukrainians feel strong cultural connection .
Western Ukraine is found to be generally more enthusiastic about EU membership than Eastern Ukraine . The political provisions of the treaty were signed on 21 March 2014 after a series of events that had stalled its ratification culminated in a revolution in Ukraine and overthrow of the then incumbent President of Ukraine , Viktor Yanukovych .
This ousting was sparked by Yanukovych &amp; apos ; s last-minute refusal to sign the agreement .
Russia , Ukraine &amp; apos ; s second largest trading partner , instead presented an association with the existing Customs Union of Russia , Belarus , and Kazakhstan as an alternative .
After 21 March 2014 matters relating to trade integration were temporarily set aside ( awaiting the results of the 25 May 2014 Ukrainian presidential elections ) until the European Union and the new Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko signed the economic part of the Ukraine – European Union Association Agreement on 27 June 2014 , and described this as Ukraine &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; first but most decisive step &amp; quot ; towards EU membership . Titles III , V , VI and VII , and the related Annexes and Protocols of the Agreement have been provisionally applied since 1 November 2014 , while Title IV has been applied from 1 January 2016 , as far as the provisions concern EU competences .
Provisions formally came into force on 1 September 2017 following ratification of the Agreement by all signatories . Beginning in the late 18th century most of Ukraine was first part of the Russian Empire .
Afterwards , Western Ukraine was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and then passed to the Second Polish Republic until the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland .
Ukraine then joined the Soviet Union ( both the Russian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR united into the Soviet Union from 1922 ) until Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union on 24 August 1991 .
Independent Ukraine originally maintained strong ties with Russia , and as such Ukraine &amp; apos ; s economy became integrated with the Russian economy . Before signing the treaty , about a third of Ukraine &amp; apos ; s foreign trade was with the European Union ( EU ) ; another third was with Russia . The European Coal and Steel Community was constituted in 1952 , consisting of six Western European countries .
This would lead to the European Union in 1992 as central powers increased , and membership increase reached 28 by 2013 .
The Union has a common market , and has amongst others the competency to conclude trade agreements .
The Union only has competence transferred to it from its member states , and thus when a treaty includes areas where it has no competence , the member states become a party to the treaty alongside the Union . On 22 July 2008 , it was announced that a &amp; quot ; Stabilisation and Association &amp; quot ; -type agreement would be signed between Ukraine and the European Union .
However , in 2011 the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs , Catherine Ashton , warned Ukraine that although talks about a European Union Association Agreement with Ukraine would continue , the ratification process of the treaty &amp; quot ; will face problems if there is no reversal in the approach of Ukrainian authorities &amp; quot ; towards the trial of former Prime Minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko .
The association agreement has to be ratified by all member states and the European Parliament for the document to take effect .
The sentencing of Tymoshenko to seven years in prison on 11 October 2011 was met with national and international protest and threatened Ukraine – European Union relations .
Tymoshenko herself stated that her imprisonment should not stop the European Union from establishing closer ties with Ukraine .
The signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the European Union , although finalised , was postponed on 19 December 2011 .
According to a joint statement by Ukraine and the EU adopted on a Ukraine-EU Summit , the ratification of the treaty depended on Ukraine &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; respect for common values and the rule of law with an independent judiciary &amp; quot ; .
The European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy , Štefan Füle , stated on 27 February 2012 that he &amp; quot ; hoped &amp; quot ; the association agreement would be initialed within a month and he &amp; quot ; saw &amp; quot ; it would be signed next autumn .
He also noted &amp; quot ; the need for action in six key areas &amp; quot ; ( mainly juridical reform and democratic freedoms ) .
On 29 February 2012 the European People &amp; apos ; s Party demanded the immediate release of Yulia Tymoshenko , Yuriy Lutsenko and other political prisoners , and insisted that the association agreement between Ukraine and the European Union should not be signed and ratified until these demands were met . The EU Association Agreement ( AA ) was initialed on 30 March 2012 in Brussels ; The treatment and sentencing ( considered by EU leaders as a politically motivated trial ) of former Prime Minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko had strained the relations between the EU and Ukraine .
The European Union and several of its member states , notably Germany , had pressured Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich and his Azarov Government to halt the detention of Tymoshenko in fear of her degrading health .
Several meetings with Yanukovich had been deserted by EU leaders , including the German president Joachim Gauck . At the request of opposition politicians in Ukraine , EU government officials boycotted the UEFA Euro 2012 championship in Ukraine .
EU leaders suggested that the AA , and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area , could not be ratified unless Ukraine addressed concerns over a &amp; quot ; stark deterioration of democracy and the rule of law &amp; quot ; , including the imprisonment of Tymoshenko and Yuriy Lutsenko in 2011 and 2012 . A 10 December 2012 statement by the EU Foreign Affairs Council &amp; quot ; reaffirms its commitment to the signing of the already initialed Association Agreement , including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area , as soon as the Ukrainian authorities demonstrate determined action and tangible progress in the three areas mentioned above , possibly by the time of the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius in November 2013 &amp; quot ; .
These three areas are : &amp; quot ; Electoral , judiciary and constitutional reforms ( in line with international standards are integral parts of it and commonly agreed priorities ) &amp; quot ; . Kostiantyn Yelisieiev , Ukraine &amp; apos ; s Ambassador to the EU , responded in February 2013 by rejecting any preconditions by the EU for signing the AA .
However , on 22 February 2013 a resolution was approved by 315 of the 349 registered members of the Verkhovna Rada stating that &amp; quot ; within its powers &amp; quot ; the parliament would ensure that the 10 December 2012 EU Foreign Affairs Council &amp; quot ; recommendations &amp; quot ; are implemented .
At the 16th EU-Ukraine summit of 25 February 2013 , The President of the European Council , Herman Van Rompuy , followed up on the December 2012 EU Foreign Affairs Council statement by reiterating the EU &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; call for determined action and tangible progress in these areas – at the latest by May , this year &amp; quot ; .
The same day President Yanukovych stated Ukraine will &amp; quot ; do its best &amp; quot ; to satisfy the EU &amp; apos ; s requirements .
At the time President Yanukovych was also in negotiations with Russia to &amp; quot ; find the right model &amp; quot ; for cooperation with the Customs Union of Belarus , Kazakhstan and Russia .
But also on 25 February 2013 President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso made it clear that &amp; quot ; one country cannot at the same time be a member of a customs union and be in a deep common free-trade area with the European Union &amp; quot ; . To coordinate preparation of Ukraine for European integration , the Government of Ukraine adopted a Plan on Priority Measures for European Integration of Ukraine for 2013 .
Successful implementation of the plan was assumed to be one of the conditions necessary for signing of the Association Agreement , planned for 29 November 2013 during the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius . In March 2013 , Stefan Fuele , the EU &amp; apos ; s Commissioner for Enlargement , informed the European Parliament that while Ukrainian authorities had given their &amp; quot ; unequivocal commitment &amp; quot ; to address the issues raised by the EU , several &amp; quot ; disturbing &amp; quot ; recent incidents , including the annulment of Tymoshenko &amp; apos ; s lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko &amp; apos ; s mandate in the Verkhovna Rada ( Ukraine &amp; apos ; s parliament ) , could delay the signing of the agreements .
However , the next day the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its optimism that they would still be signed in November .
On 7 April 2013 a decree by President Yanukovych freed Lutsenko from prison and exempted him , and his fellow Minister in the second Tymoshenko Government Heorhiy Filipchuk , from further punishment .
On 3 September 2013 , at the opening session of the Verkhovna Rada after the summer recess , President Yanukovych urged his parliament to adopt laws so that Ukraine would meet the EU criteria and be able to sign the Association Agreement in November 2013 .
On 18 September the Ukrainian cabinet unanimously approved the draft association agreement .
On 25 September 2013 Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Volodymyr Rybak stated that he was sure that his parliament would pass all the laws needed to fit the EU criteria for the Association Agreement since , except for the Communist Party of Ukraine , &amp; quot ; the Verkhovna Rada has united around these bills &amp; quot ; .
On 20 November 2013 the EU &amp; apos ; s Commissioner for Enlargement , Stefan Fuele , stated he expected that the Verkhovna Rada would the next day consider and adopt the remaining bills necessary for the signing of the association agreement , planned for 29 November 2013 . On 21 November 2013 the Verkhovna Rada failed to pass any of the six motions on allowing the former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko to receive medical treatment abroad , which was an EU demand for signing the association agreement .
The same week Tymoshenko had stated that she was ready to ask the EU to drop the demand for her freedom if it meant President Viktor Yanukovych would sign the association agreement .
The same day a Ukrainian government decree suspended preparations for signing of association agreement ; instead it proposed the creation of a three-way trade commission between Ukraine , the European Union and Russia that would resolve trade issues between the sides .
Prime Minister Mykola Azarov issued the decree in order to &amp; quot ; ensure the national security of Ukraine &amp; quot ; and in consideration of the possible ramifications of trade with Russia ( and other CIS countries ) if the agreement was signed on a 28 – 29 November summit in Vilnius .
According to Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Boyko Ukraine will resume preparing the agreement &amp; quot ; when the drop in industrial production and our relations with CIS countries are compensated by the European market , otherwise our country &amp; apos ; s economy will sustain serious damage &amp; quot ; .
Some EU diplomats were more skeptical of the reasons put forward .
Later on 21 November 2013 , the Russian presidential press secretary , Dmitry Peskov , called the Ukrainian decree &amp; quot ; a strictly internal and sovereign decision of the country , and we think we have no right to comment on it &amp; quot ; and stated that Russia was prepared to have tripartite negotiations with Ukraine and the EU on trade and economic issues .
The European Parliament &amp; apos ; s monitoring mission in Ukraine stated ( also on 21 November 2013 ) that there was still a possibility to sign the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement .
The same day Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych stated &amp; quot ; an alternative for reforms in Ukraine and an alternative for European integration do not exist . . . We are walking along this path and are not changing direction &amp; quot ; . In the following days , Euromaidan , the biggest protests since the Orange Revolution , were being held in Kyiv by opposition parties .
On 26 November 2013 the Ukrainian Government admitted that Russia had asked it to delay signing the EU association agreement and that it &amp; quot ; wanted better terms for the EU deal &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; As soon as we reach a level that is comfortable for us , when it meets our interests , when we agree on normal terms , then we will be talking about signing , &amp; quot ; President Yanukovych stated in a televised interview .
The same day Russian President Vladimir Putin called for an end to the criticism of the Ukrainian decision to delay the association agreement , and that the EU deal was bad for Russia &amp; apos ; s security interests .
Putin was responding to statements by the President of the European Council , Herman Van Rompuy , and the President of the European Commission , José Manuel Barroso , that had stated they &amp; quot ; strongly disapproved &amp; quot ; of Russia &amp; apos ; s actions .
On 26 November 2013 Prime Minister Azarov stated during a government meeting &amp; quot ; I affirm with full authority that the negotiating process over the Association Agreement is continuing , and the work on moving our country closer to European standards is not stopping for a single day &amp; quot ; .
President Yanukovych still attended the 28 – 29 November EU summit in Vilnius but the Association Agreement was not signed .
During this summit the European Union and Ukraine initialed an Air Services Agreement .
Also during the summit , President Yanukovych stated that Ukraine still wanted to sign the Association Agreement but that it needed substantial financial aid to compensate it for the threatened response from Russia , and he proposed starting three-way talks between Russia , Ukraine , and the EU .
He also urged Brussels to help Ukraine soften the terms of a possible loan from the IMF .
The EU rejected trilateral talks and asked Yanukovich to commit to sign the Association Agreement , which he refused to do .
At the end of a summit President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso stated that the EU will not tolerate &amp; quot ; a veto of a third country &amp; quot ; in their negotiations on closer integration with Ukraine .
He also stated &amp; quot ; We are embarked on a long journey , helping Ukraine to become , as others , what we call now , &amp; apos ; new member states &amp; apos ; .
But we have to set aside short-term political calculations . &amp; quot ; The President of the European Council , Herman Van Rompuy , added that &amp; quot ; we may not give in to external pressure , least of all from Russia &amp; quot ; .
Barroso reiterated that the EU &amp; apos ; s offer to Ukraine in terms of signing an Association Agreement remained on the table .
Simultaneously , President Yanukovych stated that he still intends to sign the Association Agreement at a later date &amp; quot ; once we get down to work and find solutions for economic problems , when we get the opportunity to sign a strategic partnership agreement with Russia and everything else that we need to do , so that normal relations can be established between the European Union , Russia , and Ukraine … this is our responsibility &amp; quot ; . President Viktor Yanukovych was removed from power by Ukrainian parliament majority vote after 2014 Ukrainian revolution and replaced by a new interim government in February 2014 .
At an EU summit in Brussels on 21 March 2014 , the new Ukrainian Prime Minister , Arseniy Yatseniuk , and European Union leaders Herman Van Rompuy and José Manuel Barroso , along with the 28 national political leaders or heads of state on the European Council , signed in Brussels the political provisions of the AA , with the DCFTA to be signed after the presidential election in May 2014 .
The European Union and the ( then ) new Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko signed the economic part of the Ukraine – European Union Association Agreement on 27 June 2014 , and described this as Ukraine &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; first but most decisive step &amp; quot ; towards EU membership .
President of the European Council , Herman Van Rompuy , said at the signing ceremony : &amp; quot ; In Kyiv and elsewhere , people gave their lives for this closer link to the European Union .
We will not forget this . &amp; quot ; Titles III , V , VI and VII , and the related Annexes and Protocols of the Agreement have been provisionally applied since 1 November 2014 , while Title IV has been applied from 1 January 2016 , as far as the provisions concern EU competences .
Provisions formally came into force on 1 September 2017 following ratification of the Agreement by all signatories . The ratification was performed in accordance with article 4 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the Maltese European Union Act , which reads that : &amp; quot ; Provided that with regard to treaties and international conventions which Malta may accede to as Member State of the European Union , and treaties and international conventions which Malta is bound to ratify in its own name or on behalf of the European Community by virtue of its membership within theEuropean Union , these shall come into force one month following their being submitted in order to be discussed by the Standing Committee on Foreign and European Affairs . &amp; quot ; As the treaty was submitted to the Standing Committee on Foreign and European Affairs on 21 July 2014 , the treaty came into force as part of the Maltese legislation on 21 August 2014 . Following the entry into effect of the Wet Raadgevend Referendum on 1 July 2015 , an advisory referendum is to be held for any act ( after its approval ) that is not explicitly exempted if sufficient requests are filed .
On 13 August the Kiesraad announced that 13,490 valid requests had been registered for a preliminary request for a referendum , surpassing the 10,000 threshold required .
This triggered the final phase of the referendum request , requiring 300,000 requests between 18 August and 28 September .
The Kiesraad announced on 14 October that 472,849 request had been received , 427,939 of which were held to be valid .
As the requirement was met , an advisory referendum was held on the law on 6 April 2016 .
With a turnout of 32 . 28 % , the threshold for a valid referendum was met .
61 % of votes were against the Approval Act .
As the Act was rejected , the States General has to enact a follow-up law to either repeal the Act or put it into effect after all . Following the referendum , Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte said that ratification would be put on hold during negotiations with the other parties to the treaty to find a compromise .
In December 2016 , a decision of the heads of state or government of the EU member states was approved which made legally binding interpretations of the agreement to address the concerns raised in the referendum .
In particular , it stated that it did not commit the EU to grant Ukraine EU membership candidate status , or provide security guarantees , military or financial aid , or free movement within the EU .
The decision would enter into force if the Netherlands ratified the agreement , which needed to be approved by its parliament .
In late January 2017 , the Dutch government introduced a bill to confirm approval of the agreement .
The Dutch House of Representatives approved the bill on 23 February 2017 .
The Senate approved the bill on 30 May 2017 . The ratification was based on The European Union ( Definition of Treaties ) ( Association Agreement ) ( Ukraine ) Order 2015 , made in accordance with section 1 ( 3 ) of the European Communities Act 1972 , after having been approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament . The agreement requires regular summits between the President of the European Council and the President of Ukraine .
Members of the Council of the European Union and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine must also meet regularly , as well as members of the European Parliament and the Ukrainian Parliament , and other officials and experts from both parties . The agreement also commits both parties to cooperate and converge policy , legislation , and regulation across a broad range of areas .
These include : equal rights for workers , steps towards visa-free movement of people , the exchange of information and staff in the area of justice , the modernisation of Ukraine &amp; apos ; s energy infrastructure , access to the European Investment Bank , and a variety of others . The agreement also commits Ukraine to an agenda of economic , judicial and financial reforms and to gradual approximation of its policies and legislation to those of the European Union .
Ukraine has also committed to take steps to gradually conform to technical and consumer standards upheld by the European Union .
In exchange , the European Union will provide Ukraine with political and financial support , access to research and knowledge , and preferential access to EU markets .
The agreement also commits both parties to promote a gradual convergence in the area of foreign and security policy , specifically the EU &amp; apos ; s Common Security and Defence Policy and policies set forth by the European Defence Agency . Ukraine will also ensure that its relevant national bodies participate fully in the European and international organisations for standardisation , legal and fundamental metrology , and conformity assessment including accreditation in accordance with its area of activity and the membership status available to it . Ukraine will also progressively transpose the corpus of European standards ( EN ) as national standards , including the harmonised European standards .
Simultaneously with such transposition , Ukraine will withdraw conflicting national standards , including its application of interstate standards ( GOST / ГОСТ ) , developed before 1992 .
In addition , Ukraine will progressively fulfill the other conditions for membership , in line with the requirements applicable to full members of the European Standardisation Organisations . Ukraine will approximate its sanitary and phytosanitary and animal welfare legislation to that of the EU . The parties will progressively establish a free trade area known as the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area ( DCFTA ) over a transitional period of a maximum of 10 years starting from the entry into force of the agreement . Each party will reduce or eliminate customs duties on originating goods of the other party .
Ukraine will eliminate customs duties on imports for certain worn clothing and other worn articles .
Both parties will not institute or maintain any customs duties , taxes or other measures having an equivalent effect imposed on , or in connection with , the exportation of goods to the territory of each other .
Existing customs duties or measures having equivalent effect applied by Ukraine will be phased out over a transitional period .
Each party is restricted from maintaining , introducing or reintroducing export subsidies or other measures with equivalent effect on agricultural goods destined for the territory of the other party . The parties will establish an expert-level &amp; quot ; Dialogue on Trade Remedies &amp; quot ; as a forum for cooperation in trade remedies matters .
The Dialogue will seek to enhance a party &amp; apos ; s knowledge and understanding of the other party &amp; apos ; s trade remedy laws , policies and practices ; improve cooperation between the parties &amp; apos ; authorities having responsibility for trade remedies matters ; discuss international developments in the area of trade defence ; and to cooperate on any other trade remedies matter . The parties will strengthen their cooperation in the field of technical regulations , standards , metrology , market surveillance , accreditation and conformity assessment procedures with a view to increase mutual understanding of their respective systems and facilitate access to their respective markets .
In their cooperation , the parties will seek to identify , develop and promote trade-facilitating initiatives which may include : the reinforcement of regulatory cooperation through the exchange of information , experience and data ; scientific and technical cooperation , with a view to improve the quality of their technical regulations , standards , testing , market surveillance , certification , and accreditation , and making efficient use of regulatory resources ; promote and encourage cooperation between their respective organisations , public or private , responsible for metrology , standardisation , testing , market surveillance , certification and accreditation ; foster the development of the quality infrastructure for standardisation , metrology , accreditation , conformity assessment and the market surveillance system in Ukraine ; promote Ukrainian participation in the work of related European organisations ; and seek solutions to trade barriers that may arise ; coordinate their positions in international trade and regulatory organisations such as the WTO and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ( UN-ECE ) . Ukraine will take the necessary measures in order to gradually achieve conformity with EU technical regulations and EU standardisation , metrology , accreditation , conformity assessment procedures and the market surveillance system , and undertakes to follow the principles and practices laid down in relevant EU Decisions and Regulations .
For this purpose Ukraine will : While work on signing a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement between Ukraine and the EU first began in 1999 , formal negotiations between the Ukrainian government and the EU Trade Commissioner were not launched until 18 February 2008 .
As of May 2011 there remained three outstanding issues to be resolved in the free trade deal : quotas on Ukrainian grain exports , access to the EU &amp; apos ; s services market and geographical names of Ukrainian commodities .
Aside from these issues , the deal was ready .
Despite those outstanding issues , Ukraine was ready to sign the agreement as it stood .
Although it wanted stronger wording on enlargement prospects and access to the EU market for its truckers , Ukraine had more than many other candidates at the equivalent stage of the process .
The finalised agreement was initialed on 19 July 2012 .
Ratification of the DCFTA , like the AA , has been stalled by the EU over concerns over the rule of law in Ukraine .
This includes the application of selective justice , as well as amending electoral laws .
As a result , the role of Ukrainian oligarchs in sanctioning the agreement was also questioned . If Ukraine would choose the agreement , the Eurasian Economic Commission &amp; apos ; s Customs Union of Belarus , Kazakhstan and Russia would withdraw from free trade agreements with the country , according to Russian presidential advisor Sergei Glazyev .
However , on 21 November 2013 a Ukrainian government decree suspended preparations for signing the agreement that was scheduled to be signed during a 28 – 29 November 2013 EU summit in Vilnius , and it was not signed .
The decision to put off signing the association agreement led to 2014 Ukrainian revolution . Before the final signing of the agreement on 27 June 2014 Russian officials stated Russia could very likely raise tariffs on Ukrainian imports , Russia is Ukraine &amp; apos ; s single largest export market , accounting for nearly a quarter of Ukraine &amp; apos ; s international trade .
However , after the Russian aggression against Ukraine the EU has become Ukraine &amp; apos ; s largest trading partner .
It is also its main source of Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) . According to BBC News Ukrainian free access to the EU internal market ( the world &amp; apos ; s biggest free trade area ) &amp; quot ; is supposed to bring a boost in the long term &amp; quot ; to the economy of Ukraine .
And the fact that Ukraine has agreed in the treaty to implement EU rules and stipulations should improve Ukraine &amp; apos ; s business climate as a whole &amp; quot ; The country will be required to introduce wide-ranging reforms - increasing transparency , reducing corruption and raising the quality of its output &amp; quot ; .
But it warned that &amp; quot ; in the short term , this will cause a great deal of pain and disruption &amp; quot ; . As of 2016 , tariff-free quotas for the export of most agricultural products to the EU were very small .
On 29 July 2013 Russia banned the import of chocolate products made by the Ukrainian company Roshen and asked Belarus and Kazakhstan to follow suit .
A Russian sanitary official stated that the company had not met quality and safety standards , but critics alleged that the ban was meant as a warning against Ukraine associating more closely with the EU .
The owner of Roshen , Petro Poroshenko , is the current president of Ukraine , and at the time was seen as pro-European .
On 14 August 2013 , Federal Customs Service of Russia officials began conducting more stringent inspections of cargo arriving from Ukraine than would normally be carried out .
This lasted until 20 August 2013 and was followed by statements from the Russian President &amp; apos ; s top economic advisor Sergey Glazyev arguing that the impact of Russia &amp; apos ; s response to Ukraine signing the agreement , including tariffs and trade checks , could lead to default , a decline in the standard of living and &amp; quot ; political and social unrest &amp; quot ; in Ukraine , and would violate the Russian-Ukrainian strategic partnership and friendship treaty .
The latter , he warned , would mean that Ukraine &amp; apos ; s statehood could not be guaranteed by Russia , which might intervene in the country at the request of pro-Russian regions . Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that members of the Customs Union of Belarus , Kazakhstan and Russia may impose what he called protective measures in the event of trade liberalization between Ukraine and the EU .
The EU condemned Russia &amp; apos ; s threats , calling them unacceptable .
Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov urged Russia &amp; quot ; to accept the reality of Ukraine signing the EU agreement &amp; quot ; and condemned any artificial barriers as pointless . Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich reaffirmed his commitment to the agreement during his annual Independence Day of Ukraine speech on 24 August , and called it an incentive for Ukraine to become a modern European state .
In the same speech , he also called for the preservation and deepening of ties with &amp; quot ; . . . Russia , countries of the Eurasian community , other world leaders and new centers of economic development . &amp; quot ; Ukrainian pro-European opposition politicians commented that Russian actions were consistent with a leaked document outlining a Russian Government strategy to enlarge the Customs Union of Belarus , Kazakhstan and Russia to Ukraine and to prevent its further association with Euro-Atlantic structures .
Among other things , the 14-page document lists efforts to promote pro-Russian rhetoric in the media dominated by anti-Russian opinions , sanctioning pro-European Ukrainian business owners , TV magnates and politicians , efforts to elect pro-Russian Viktor Medvedchuk as president in 2015 and a subsequent purge of pro-European civil servants .
The paper also mentions cooperation with Belarus and Kazakhstan in this regard .
Experts commenting on the &amp; quot ; leaked document &amp; quot ; argued that Medvedchuk had no chance of winning the 2015 Presidential election and could not seriously disrupt the signing of the Association Agreement . On 19 September 2013 President Putin stated that Russia would impose &amp; quot ; protectionist measures &amp; quot ; against Ukraine once the EU Association Agreement was implemented .
The next day Aleksei Pushkov , chairman of the State Duma ( Russia &amp; apos ; s main parliament ) committee on international affairs commented that Ukraine was entering into an EU &amp; quot ; semi-colonial dependence &amp; quot ; .
On 8 October 2013 President Putin stated the free trade agreement &amp; quot ; may create certain problems for trade and cooperation .
Certain damage may be done to the economic sphere but we will not have any problems in the political field , I am certain &amp; quot ; . After the economic part of the Ukraine – European Union Association Agreement was signed on 27 June 2014 ( by the new President Petro Poroshenko ) Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that making Ukraine choose between Russia and the EU would split the country in two . In trilateral talks in early September 2014 , the European Commission , the Government of Ukraine and Russia agreed on deferring the provisional implementation of the agreement until the end of 2015 .
&amp; quot ; We have agreed to postpone the application until December 31 next year , &amp; quot ; said EU - Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht on September 12 , 2014 in Brussels at the end of talks with Alexey Ulyukaev , the Russian Minister of Economic Affairs , and Pavlo Klimkin , Foreign Minister of Ukraine .
According to Interfax , the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko had advocated this decision .
Pavlo Klimkin stated Ukraine would also benefit from the postponement : &amp; quot ; This is a very important decision and we are very grateful to the EU for offering a privileged access to the European market .
This allows our companies to prepare for the further liberalization of trade . “ The approval of the EU countries is still pending .
The unilateral trade facilitation - the abolition of import duties in the EU - will remain in force - on the condition of the approval of the EU Council of Ministers .
Tariffs on EU products exported into Ukraine persist . In the background there are Russia &amp; apos ; s concerns about negative effects on the Russian economy , should EU-products get into the Russian market through Ukraine .
Therefore , the Russian government had announced new tariffs on Ukrainian products if , as planned , the Association Agreement entered into force as planned on 1 November 2014 .
The damage to the Russian economy by eliminating import tariffs in Ukraine is estimated to amount to 2 billion dollars by the Russian side .
On 1 September 2014 , Russia had put forward a list of 2370 change requests concerning the consequences for the Russian-Ukrainian trade .
The list had been requested by Karel de Gucht on July 11 , 2014 .
According to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung there was growing belief in Brussels that &amp; quot ; the economic ties between Moscow and Kyiv can not be ignored . &amp; quot ; Before entering into force &amp; quot ; thousands of exceptions are to be agreed on &amp; quot ; , informs the Süddeutsche Zeitung , referring to sources in Brussels .

Right Thoughts , Right Words , Right ActionRight Thoughts , Right Words , Right Action is the fourth studio album by Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand .
It was released through the Domino Recording Company on 26 August 2013 in the United Kingdom and on 27 August in the United States .
It was the band &amp; apos ; s first studio album since &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; , which was released four years earlier . Recorded during 2013 , the album was recorded in multiple studios in different locations .
It also features production from multiple different musicians .
Similar to &amp; quot ; Tonight &amp; quot ; , the album features more of a dance-oriented sound throughout .
The band focused on making a generally positive and uplifting album with &amp; quot ; Right Thoughts , Right Words , Right Action &amp; quot ; .
Band member Alex Kapranos , who provided production on the album , labeled it the band &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; most positive record &amp; quot ; , stating that the album title reflects the mood of the album as well as the mood of the band members during the recording of the album . The album received generally favourable reviews from music critics upon its release .
It also had a significant commercial performance , with the album charting in the top 10 in several countries , including the band &amp; apos ; s home country of Scotland , where it peaked at number 2 , and the UK , where it peaked at number 6 .
The album spawned six singles : &amp; quot ; Right Action &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Love Illumination &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Evil Eye &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Bullet &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Fresh Strawberries &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; Stand on the Horizon &amp; quot ; . The band previewed many of their new tracks at live performances over 2012 and 2013 .
The album was recorded during 2013 at Alex Kapranos &amp; apos ; Black Pudding Studio in Glasgow , Scotland , Nick McCarthy &amp; apos ; s Sausage Studios and Mark Ralph &amp; apos ; s Club Ralph in London , England , and Björn Yttling &amp; apos ; s Ingrid Studio in Stockholm , Sweden .
According to band drummer Paul Thomson , most of the material on the album had been written and demoed at Sausage Studio and Black Pudding .
The band recalled having about five or six sessions of recording .
Instead of recording all the music at once , they sought out to record different batches of songs over a period of time .
Kapranos described the album direction as &amp; quot ; forward &amp; quot ; and revealed that the band decided to keep a low profile about things as their last album was &amp; quot ; tainted &amp; quot ; by misinformation prior to its release .
Regarding the lyrics , Kapranos said : the idea of the cynic &amp; apos ; s search for optimism and the sceptic &amp; apos ; s search for a manual crop up here and there .
I &amp; apos ; ve always liked the lead character in Alasdair Gray &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; growing the hard scales to defend the soft inner-self from the world .
Socially awkward asthmatic with a self-consuming imagination .
My 19-year-old self was electrified .
Maybe the album is about how to shed those scales . &amp; quot ; Kapranos had talked about the background of the album title in a documentary about the album : I think when you name a record , you have to choose something which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs .
You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record , but the mood of the people who made it . . .
the mood of those people when they recorded it , and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas , but &amp; quot ; Right Thoughts , Right Words , Right Action &amp; quot ; seemed to sum it up best .
It &amp; apos ; s probably the most positive record we &amp; apos ; ve made , and the band have been , yeah , the most optimistic we &amp; apos ; ve been since before we had any encounter with the music industry . . .
probably because we &amp; apos ; ve been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much . The title echoes the Noble Eightfold Path which is eight practices in Buddhism . For &amp; quot ; Right Thoughts , Right Words , Right Action &amp; quot ; , Franz Ferdinand collaborated with other artists for parts of the album .
Hot Chip band members Joe Goddard and Alexis Taylor produced the opening track &amp; quot ; Right Action &amp; quot ; and co-produced the final track &amp; quot ; Goodbye Lovers and Friends &amp; quot ; , Norwegian DJ Todd Terje co-produced the tracks &amp; quot ; Evil Eye &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Stand on the Horizon &amp; quot ; , and Peter Bjorn and John band member Björn Yttling produced &amp; quot ; Treason ! Animals . &amp; quot ; and co-produced &amp; quot ; The Universe Expanded &amp; quot ; .
All tracks on the album were written by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy , with additional writing from Bob Hardy on &amp; quot ; Right Action &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; The Universe Expanded &amp; quot ; as well as Alexander Ragnew on &amp; quot ; Bullet &amp; quot ; .
Kapranos also co-produced the majority of the album under the pseudonym &amp; quot ; Prince House Rabbit &amp; quot ; , with the exception of &amp; quot ; Right Action &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Treason ! Animals . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Right Thoughts , Right Words , Right Action &amp; quot ; features indie rock , dance-punk , and disco-rock throughout .
The opening line to &amp; quot ; Right Action &amp; quot ; was inspired by a postcard Alex Kapranos had found in London , which featured the phrase &amp; quot ; Come home , practically all is nearly forgiven &amp; quot ; .
The following line &amp; quot ; Right thoughts , right words , right action &amp; quot ; was thought of as a &amp; quot ; great response &amp; quot ; to the former by Kapranos .
&amp; quot ; Evil Eye &amp; quot ; is about the evil eye and all-seeing eye , which are things that Kapranos was very interested about .
The guitar riff to &amp; quot ; Love Illumination &amp; quot ; was created by Kapranos and originally thought of as &amp; quot ; too rocky &amp; quot ; by Nick McCarthy , but he later claimed that he enjoyed playing it .
The song was fully written and recorded during a weekend session at McCarthy &amp; apos ; s Sausage Studio .
Kapranos explained the meaning of the song by stating : We all feel as sensitive to satisfaction at times .
We can look outside us and see nothing but destruction , avarice , and boredom .
So we look to find that love where we can find it .
Some people look to Hollywood , some people look to Blackpool and the bright lights of Blackpool .
That &amp; apos ; s probably where I would look . &amp; quot ; Stand on the Horizon &amp; quot ; was labeled by Kapranos as something neither Franz Ferdinand or Todd Terje , the co-producer of the song , have done before .
He also called the ending of the song &amp; quot ; a beautiful , uplifting piece of music &amp; quot ; .
For &amp; quot ; Fresh Strawberries &amp; quot ; , the band called upon Roxanne Clifford of Veronica Falls to provide additional vocals for the song .
The band originally wanted a falsetto section for the song , but they were not able to reach the necessary high notes themselves , which is why they wanted Clifford to provide vocals .
The idea for &amp; quot ; The Universe Expanded &amp; quot ; comes from the theory of universe expansion .
Kapranos calls the song both &amp; quot ; heartbreaking &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; funny &amp; quot ; at the same time .
The song also features a heartbeat for a kick drum and scratches of stubble for hi-hats . The album originally intended to feature 11 songs , including &amp; quot ; Scarlet &amp; amp ; Blue &amp; quot ; ( also known as &amp; quot ; Bring Me Your Love &amp; quot ; ) which was often played during the band &amp; apos ; s 2012 tour .
However , the band didn &amp; apos ; t manage to fit it to the final track listing and ultimately left the song unreleased . The album was announced on 14 May 2013 with a teaser trailer video along with updates from the band &amp; apos ; s social networks , revealing the cover art , the album title and the full track listing .
On the same day , the album was also made available to pre-order from Domino in various versions .

The exclusive bonus disc in both the double CD and double vinyl LP , entitled &amp; quot ; Right Notes , Right Words , Wrong Order &amp; quot ; , is a live session recording captured at Konk Studios in London .

At &amp; quot ; Digital Spy &amp; quot ; , Adam Silverstein commends that &amp; quot ; more often than not , &amp; quot ; Right Thoughts , Right Words , Right Action &amp; quot ; is this band sharpening their particular surefire indie to glittering distinction . &amp; quot ; Commenting on the band &amp; apos ; s future , he says that the &amp; quot ; half-sorry , half-bitter &amp; apos ; Goodbye Lovers &amp; amp ; Friends &amp; apos ; is probably not Franz Ferdinand &amp; apos ; s very last act , even if Kapranos proclaiming in the final seconds &amp; apos ; But this really is the end &amp; apos ; would make one awesome blowout .
Although after delivering a record as good as this , they can take as long as they want &amp; quot ; .
At &amp; quot ; The A . V .
Club &amp; quot ; , Annie Zaleski wrote positively of the musical differences between many of this album &amp; apos ; s tracks compared to the band &amp; apos ; s prior work , adding : &amp; quot ; Admittedly , these more nuanced &amp; quot ; Right Thoughts , Right Words , Right Action &amp; quot ; sounds aren &amp; apos ; t as easily accessible ; it &amp; apos ; s much easier to gravitate toward more familiar raucous post-punk ( &amp; apos ; Bullet , &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; Right Action &amp; apos ; ) or the Clash-reminiscent punk-funk of &amp; apos ; Evil Eye . &amp; apos ; But by expanding its worldview , Franz Ferdinand has very nicely settled onto a path toward career longevity . &amp; quot ; Writing for &amp; quot ; Mojo &amp; quot ; , Victoria Segal says that &amp; quot ; Franz Ferdinand remain in robust good health , athletic aesthetes who have yet to break their stride .
There &amp; apos ; s no great leap forward here but the spring in their step is unmistakable .
All present , all correct . &amp; quot ; At &amp; quot ; Alternative Press &amp; quot ; , Reed Fischer called the title &amp; quot ; resolute &amp; quot ; , and said that &amp; quot ; fortunately , his cruelty translates into charming melodies here that &amp; quot ; almost &amp; quot ; excuse the long wait for them . &amp; quot ; Conversely , Tim Stegall in &amp; quot ; The Austin Chronicle &amp; quot ; wrote : &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; T &amp; # 93 ; he satisfaction appears sonic alone : Not a song sticks .
It &amp; apos ; s sheer style that carries this disc . &amp; quot ; Caleb Caldwell for &amp; quot ; Slant Magazine &amp; quot ; wrote : More or less the Scottish answer to American bands like Interpol and the Strokes , Franz Ferdinand , with their du-jour cool and deft combination of insular art flair and dance-floor populism , was hailed by British hype machine New Musical Express as the dawn of a new rock revolution .
The band &amp; apos ; s blue-blazered appeal , however , started to slip after 2009 &amp; apos ; s overly serious concept album &amp; quot ; Tonight : Franz Ferdinand &amp; quot ; .
Four years later , the zeitgeist may prefer its rock stars with suspenders and banjos , but Franz Ferdinand &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Right Thoughts , Right Words , Right Action &amp; quot ; is an unapologetically swaggering disco-rock album that refuses to overstay its welcome .

Ulvi LiegiUlvi Liegi ( born Luigi Levi ; 1858 – 1939 ) was an Italian painter belonging to the Postmacchiaioli movement .
He is mostly notable for the cityscapes of Livorno and paintings of Livornese daily life . Luigi Levi , who signed his paintings as Ulvi Liegi ( an anagram of his real name ) , was born in Livorno in a wealthy Jewish family .
He got initial art education in Livorno , and then he moved to Florence , where he studied in the Academy of Arts under Adolfo Tommasi , Carlo Markò the Younger , and Giuseppe Ciaranfi .
While in Florence , he became friends with many artists from the Macchiaioli group , first Telemaco Signorini , and later one of the leaders of the group , Giovanni Fattori .
Liegi first exhibited his paintings in 1882 , and got positive responses .
In the 1880s , he painted in the style close to the Macchiaioli , but later started to paint in a style close to impressionism .
In 1886 – 1888 Liegi visited Paris , where he studied works of impressionists , and London ; in 1889 , two of his works were exhibited in the World &amp; apos ; s Fair in Paris . In 1882 , he exhibited at the Mostra of the Società d &amp; apos ; incoraggiamento delle Belle Arti of Florence three studies &amp; quot ; dal vero &amp; quot ; ; in 1884 , Liegi sent to Turin three landscapes : &amp; quot ; Un tramonto lungo il Mugnone &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; Una giornata grigia nei campì &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; Un effetto autunnale &amp; quot ; .
On 1887 at Venice , he exhibited : &amp; quot ; After the rain &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; Sulla strada del Romito a Florence &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; Giornata invernale &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; Sulla sera al Manzollo presso Florence &amp; quot ; .
In 1888 , he exhibited at Bologna : &amp; quot ; Nei campi , dopo the pioggia &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; Giornata d &amp; apos ; inverno , presso San Gervasio &amp; quot ; , large dal vero study .
The same year in London and in 1889 at Paris and at the Promotrice of Florence , he sent : &amp; quot ; Nel Mugnone &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; Tramonto &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; Casolari in montagna &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; Garda &amp; quot ; ; and &amp; quot ; Barche peschereccie a Riva ed altri &amp; quot ; . From 1890 to 1908 , Liegi lived in Florence , but often spent summers in Liguria .
In 1908 , he moved to Livorno , and stayed there until his death in 1939 .
He was involved with the Postmacchiaioli , of which he and Llewelyn Lloyd are considered to be the best known representatives .
In 1918 , Liegi had his first personal exhibition , in Galleria Mario Galli in Florence .
Since 1920 , he was the president of the Gruppo Labronico and promoted Livornese art .
He died in 1939 in extreme poverty . At Giovanni Fattori Civic Museum of Livorno are At the National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art of Rome :

The 3 . 8x maximum zoom of the lens is relatively limited , however , and zooming limits the aperture .
For example , at 2x optical zoom , the maximum aperture ( lowest f-stop ) is f / 1 . 8 , and at 3 . 8x zoom it is f / 2 . 3 . No lens correction is applied to files stored in RAW mode ( . RW2 extension ) .
The following table provides empirically determined lens distortion factors that can be used with the GIMP image processing software ’ s “ Lens Distortion ” plug-in to approximate the lens-correction provided by the camera in its JPEG images : The experimental estimates for the “ zoom ” value do not follow any consistent curve , and a constant “ zoom ” value of -1 . 0 may be appropriate .

Rayburn , West VirginiaRayburn is an unincorporated community in Mason County , West Virginia .
Arizona RanchoThe Arizona Rancho , also known as the Higgins House , Brunswick Hotel and Arizona Hotel , is a former hotel in Holbrook , Arizona .
It was originally built between 1881 and 1883 as a residence , the expanded as a boarding house , a hotel , and finally as a motel .
The original structure is thought to be the oldest extant structure in Holbrook . The original house was built by Pedro Montaño , probably as a single-story house , using plastered adobe .
With its dormers and steeply-pitched roof , it represents a hybrid of Hispanic and Anglo building styles .
The house was expanded about 1885 with a two-story wing of adobe bricks , the Higgins addition , after an 1884 sale of the property to James and Maggie Higgins , who established a boarding house .
After several changes of ownership , the Higgins House became the Brunswick Hotel after 1889 , operated by John and Anna Connor .
The upstairs portion of the addition was used as a dance hall and as a Masonic lodge .
After several more changes of ownership the property was bought by S .
Earle Taylor , an oil investor , to house workers .
The property has remained in the Taylor family since then .
Lloyd Taylor , a geologist , bought the hotel from his uncle . During the 1930s the west wing of the Brunswick Hotel was Holbrook &amp; apos ; s hospital .
A kitchen addition , necessitated by this change was designed in the mid-1930s by Lorimore Skidmore .
Skidmore went on to design the later additions after the hotel became the Arizona Hotel .
In the 1940s the compound was enclosed with an adobe wall , and adobe loggias were added , and the hotel &amp; apos ; s name was hanged again to the Arizona Rancho .
During World War II the hotel was leased by Fullerton Junior College to house pilot candidates training for the U . S .
Navy at Park Field in Holbrook .
The Taylor family added to the complex for their own living quarters at this time . With the end of the war , business prospered .
The hotel catered to tourists going to California on U . S .
66 , which ran through Holbrook .
However , the main road was farther north , and a new commercial district developed along 66 a few blocks to the north of the old town center , which had been oriented to the railroad line .
The construction of Interstate 40 farther away caused further decline , leading to the hotel &amp; apos ; s closure after some time as a youth hostel . The Arizona Rancho compound is located on a corner lot to the south of the present Holbrook business district , between the railroad tracks and the Little Colorado River .
The buildings are arranged on the north side of the site , facing an open , partially walled parking area .
The wall is broken by openings with decorative wagon wheels set into the spaces , echoed by round window openings in the main building with inset wagon wheels .
The complex is described as a &amp; quot ; hodgepodge &amp; quot ; of additions and styles .
It retains a general Southwestern style with an emphasis on Pueblo Revival style , mainly expressed in the motel addition .
The Montaño residence alone has a steeply-pitched roof , partly obscured by a later two-story adobe addition . The motel section is a long , low structure with projecting vigas over the fronting porch .
Windows throughout the complex are framed in heavy wood timbers that are flush with the adobe plaster exterior wall finish .
The motel wing includes a variety of wall materials , including stone , wood framing covered with stucco , and an adaptation of log-style construction with old wood posts laid up and chinked with stucco . The Arizona Rancho was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 17 , 1997 .
In 2007 plans were advanced to sell some surrounding properties and to restore the Rancho .

He came from an educated , middle-class family and studied music ( mainly piano ) locally .
Upon the first publication of his work in 1907 , he moved to Munich to study aesthetics and music theory under Franz Wiedermeyer .
He also studied composition in Leipzig with Max Reger , for whom Taltabull dedicated his &amp; quot ; Sonatina per a piano &amp; quot ; ( 1910 ) . In 1911 , after a brief stay in Barcelona , he established himself in Paris working as a composer , pianist , and arranger .
While in Paris , he continued his musical studies with André Gedalge , Charles Tournemire and Charles Koechlin .

SA Bus and Taxi Association v Cape of Good Hope BankIn SA Bus and Taxi Association v Cape of Good Hope Bank , an important case in the South African law of lease , the applicant had expressed interest in hiring certain business premises owned by the respondent , to which it had been introduced by the respondent &amp; apos ; s agents , DRE .
As a consequence , DRE forwarded to the applicant &amp; apos ; s head office a memorandum of agreement of lease for signature , accompanied by a letter dated September 18 , in which the applicant was requested to return the memorandum , duly signed , as soon as possible , together with a cheque for the first month &amp; apos ; s rental , deposit and incidental charges .
The lease was to commence on October 1 , 1986 .
In terms of clause 3 of the memorandum , rental was payable in advance on the first day of each month , failing which the lessor was entitled summarily to cancel the lease . On October 8 , the applicant sent a letter to DRE enclosing a cheque for the amount requested and advising DRE that the memorandum would be signed and returned after its executive meeting , which would be held at the end of October .
The respondent deposited the cheque . The memorandum was signed on November 4 , and was returned , together with a cheque for November rental , to DRE .
That cheque was not deposited .
Instead , it was returned to the applicant , together with a cheque for the amount previously tendered and deposited .
The applicant was informed in writing that the respondent had not regarded itself as having concluded an agreement of lease with it . The applicant applied for an interdict to prevent the respondent from leasing the premises to any other person on the grounds that a valid lease agreement had been concluded and had not been validly cancelled , and for a &amp; quot ; mandamus &amp; quot ; directing the respondent to allow the applicant free and undisturbed access to the premises . The applicant alleged that the respondent &amp; apos ; s conduct had been motivated by commercial racism , which the respondent strenuously denied .
It contended that no agreement had been concluded : DRE &amp; apos ; s letter to the applicant , enclosing the memorandum , had been no more than an invitation to the applicant to submit an offer to lease the respondent &amp; apos ; s premises , which the applicant had done by signing the memorandum .
That offer the respondent had not accepted .
It submitted , in the alternative , that , if a valid agreement had been concluded ( which was not conceded ) , it had justifiably cancelled that agreement due to non-payment of rental for October and November by the due date , being the first day of the month . The court held , as to the issue of whether or not a valid agreement of lease had been concluded , that an examination of the letter written to the applicant by DRE on September 18 , and the applicant &amp; apos ; s reply thereto , dated 8 October , made it clear that the parties had reached consensus on the essentials of the lease : Once the applicant had accepted the terms and conditions contained in the memorandum attached to DRE &amp; apos ; s letter ( which it had , by sending its cheque for the first month &amp; apos ; s rental , deposit and other charges ) , a binding agreement would have been concluded between the parties . The court held that the argument that the memorandum of agreement had to be signed , at least by the applicant , if not by both parties , before a contract of lease came into existence , could not be upheld .
There had been nothing in DRE &amp; apos ; s letter of September 18 to indicate that signature of the memorandum was a precondition for the existence of a legally valid contract .
The fact that the respondent had accepted and deposited the applicant &amp; apos ; s cheque was yet another indication that a lease had come into existence . The respondent , then , had failed to discharge the onus of proving that signature by the parties to the memorandum had been an essential prerequisite to a binding lease . As to the question of whether or not the lease had been validly cancelled , the court held that the agreement had not provided for any days of grace for the payment of rent .
The respondent had thus been entitled to terminate the lease when the applicant had submitted payment for November after November 1 .
The applicant , therefore , had no right to occupy the premises and no right to restrain the respondent from leasing them to other persons .

Eastern Cape v Contract PropsEastern Cape v Contract Props , an important case in the South African law of lease , Eastern Cape entered into a contract of lease with the respondent , without complying with or without making use of procedures prescribed by the Provincial Tender Board Act . Section 4 ( 1 ) of the Provincial Tender Board Act provides , &amp; quot ; inter alia &amp; quot ; , that the tender board established in terms of the Actshall have the sole power to procure supplies and services for the province , and , subject to the provisions of any other Act of the provincial legislature , to arrange the hiring or letting of anything or the acquisition or granting of any right for or on behalf of the province , and to dispose of movable provincial property , and may for that purpose — ( a ) on behalf of the province conclude an agreement , which shall be in writing , with a person within or outside the Republic for the furnishing of supplies and services to the province or for the hiring or letting of anything or the acquisition or granting of any right for or on behalf of the province or for the disposal of movable provincial property ; ( b ) with a view to concluding an agreement referred to in para ( a ) , in any manner it may deem fit , invite offers and determine the manner in which and the conditions subject to which such offers shall be made . These and other provisions of the Act , the court noted , show how important a role the tender board is intended to play in ensuring good governance in the field of procurement policies and procedures , and the priority accorded to fair dealing and equitable relationships among parties to provincial contracts .
It was difficult to see any room for the co-existence of a power residing in other entities or persons within the provincial administration to do , without any reference whatsoever to the tender board , that which section 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) and ( b ) empowers the tender board to do .
That the tender board &amp; quot ; acts on behalf of the province &amp; quot ; in arranging to hire premises , or in concluding a lease , could not derogate from the fact that section 4 ( 1 ) disables the province from acting autonomously in this regard . The mischief which the Act seeks to prevent was plain enough to the court : It is to eliminate patronage or worse in the awarding of contracts , to provide members of the public with opportunities to tender to fulfil provincial needs , and to ensure the fair , impartial and independent exercise of the power to award provincial contracts . If contracts were permitted to be concluded without any reference to the tender board , and without any resultant sanction of invalidity , the very mischief which the Act seeks to combat could be perpetuated .
Accordingly , the court held that leases entered into by a department of the provincial government ( as lessee ) without the tender board &amp; apos ; s having arranged the hiring of the premises in terms of section 4 ( 1 ) of the Act , are invalid .
Stanislav JungwirthStanislav Jungwirth ( 15 August 1930 - 11 April 1986 ) was a Czechoslovak middle-distance runner .
Jungwirth placed third in the 1500 metres at the 1954 European Championships and set a world record for the same distance in 1957 . Jungwirth started training seriously in 1949 .
By 1951 he was already a quality runner , clocking 3 : 48 . 8 for 1500 metres ; &amp; quot ; Track and Field News &amp; quot ; ranked him No .
8 in the world that year .
In 1952 he won the Czechoslovak championship at both 800 and 1500 metres and was selected to run the latter distance at the Olympics in Helsinki , where he survived the heats but went out in the semi-finals .
Late in October 1952 , he set a new world record at 1000 metres in Stará Boleslav , running 2 : 21 . 2 to improve Olle Åberg &amp; apos ; s time by 0 . 1 seconds .
This record was broken less than ten months later by the United States &amp; apos ; Mal Whitfield . Jungwirth continued improving and won his only international medal at the 1954 European Championships in Bern , where he placed third behind Roger Bannister and Gunnar Nielsen with a time of 3 : 45 . 4 .
At the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne he finished 6th in 3 : 42 . 6 . On 12 July 1957 - again in Stará Boleslav - Jungwirth ran 1500 metres in 3 : 38 . 1 , breaking the world record of 3 : 40 . 2 set just the previous day by Finland &amp; apos ; s Olavi Salsola and Olavi Salonen .
A week later in London , he became the first Czechoslovak to run a four-minute mile ; however , his clocking of 3 : 59 . 1 was only good enough for third place while the winner , Derek Ibbotson , ran a new world record 3 : 57 . 2 . Jungwirth suffered from health problems in 1958 and only placed 8th at the European Championships , even though his time of 3 : 44 . 4 was a second faster than his bronze medal performance in 1954 .
He lost his world record on 28 August 1958 , when Australia &amp; apos ; s Herb Elliott ran 3 : 36 . 0 in Göteborg ; Jungwirth himself placed second in that race in 3 : 39 . 0 .
Jungwirth &amp; apos ; s health problems continued in 1959 and 1960 and he was unable to take part in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome .
He retired from athletics as a result . &amp; quot ; Track and Field News &amp; quot ; ranked Jungwirth in the world &amp; apos ; s top 10 at 1500 metres a total of seven times between 1951 and 1959 , with a highest ranking of No .
3 in 1957 .
Jungwirth also made the top 10 at 800 metres in 1952 and 1953 .
Ntombikayise Priscilla KhubekaNtombikayise ( Ntombi ) Priscilla Khubeka is a former South African anti-apartheid activist and a member of the armed wing of the ANC , Umkhonto we Sizwe .
She died at the age of 41 in 1987 after being abducted and interrogated by Apartheid forces due to her role as a co-ordinator for Umkhonto we Sizwe ( MK ) .
Khubeka ’ s death was highly disputed during the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , in which Apartheid officers originally claimed they were not responsible for her death .
Her body was exhumed in May 1997 , near KwaDukuza , revealing that Khubeka had been shot by the Apartheid officers . Khubeka lived in KwaMashu , a township north of Durban .
She acted as a co-ordinator for externally and internally trained MK members living in KwaMashu .
Wanting to obtain information on the arrival of four MK members from Swaziland , Vlakplaas police officers combined their resources with the Durban security branch to infiltrate Khubeka ’ s network .
Under the command of Captain Adriaan David Baker working with the Port Natal Security Branch , two C1 / Vlakplaas askaris , Simon Radebe and Xola Frank ‘ Jimmy ’ Mbane , were tasked to make contact with her .
Pretending to be MK members , they offered to help her accommodate activists from Swaziland .
In May 1987 , Mr Mbane drove Ms Khubeka to Battery Beach from where she was abducted by the Port Natal team .
She was blindfolded , bound and taken to an abandoned shooting range at Winkelspruit , south of Durban .
Still blindfolded , she was then subjected to interrogation by the Port Natal Security Branch .
This team consisted of Colonel Andy Taylor , Captain Hentie Botha , Sergeant Laurance ‘ Laurie ’ Wasserman , Sergeant Cassie van der Westhuizen , Joe Coetzer and Warrant Officer ‘ Bossie ’ Basson . During amnesty hearings conducted by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , contrasting details surrounding Khubeka &amp; apos ; s death were given by those involved in her death .
Captain Botha stated the interrogation was conducted largely in Zulu by Colonel Taylor , during which he struck Ms Khubeka across the back with a sjambok .
According to Captain Botha , this was not a severe assault but intended to convey the gravity of the situation and persuade her to co-operate with them .
Captain Botha testified that the interrogation lasted approximately fifteen to twenty minutes and that Taylor struck her approximately ten to fifteen times with a sjambok .
Sergeant van der Westhuizen ’ s testimony suggests that the interrogation lasted an hour .
Both of these accounts were disputed by Mbane who alleged that the interrogation lasted for approximately two hours , during which he could hear her screams of pain from outside .
Botha and other applicants testified that , during the course of the interrogation , Ms Khubeka agreed to co-operate with them but that she suddenly died of a heart attack .
They claimed she grabbed her chest and fell over , experiencing a heart attack due to her being overweight . Ms Khubeka ’ s dead body was dumped near the Bhambayi informal settlement , some distance away from her home by Sergeants Wasserman and Salman Gerhardus du Preez .
Captain Botha established that her family was unaware of her death and appeared to believe that she had gone into exile .
It was subsequently rumoured that she had left the country for Mozambique because of the attentions of the Security Branch . These claims of the details surrounding Khubeka ’ s death were seriously challenged by Khubeka ’ s family .
They contended that the police shot her in the head before dumping her body , which was confirmed following the exhumation of her body .
The TRC ’ s Investigative Unit exhumed remains believed to be Ms Khubeka ’ s from a pauper ’ s grave at Charlottedale Cemetery , KwaDukuza in May 1997 .
The applicants charged that the wrong body had been exhumed .
In the post-mortem examination , a pathologist concluded that the remains matched those of Ntombi Khubeka .
A spent 7 . 65mm bullet was found in the skull , indicating that she had been shot in the head .
An attempt to use DNA testing from samples of bone and teeth failed as these had deteriorated and could not be used for DNA typing .
The skull was sent to the University of Glasgow , which made a positive facial identification of the skull .
Challenging these findings , the applicants demanded that another expert examine the skull .
A report by the South African Police Service Forensic Science Laboratory in Pretoria further confirmed that the skull belonged to Ntombi Khubeka .
The applicants did not challenge these conclusions , although they continued to contest the results of the investigation .
The six members of the Port Natal Security Branch , Radebe and Baker applied for amnesty for their role in the abduction , death and subsequent disposal of the body of Ms Khubeka .
Applicants Botha , Du Preez , Wasserman and Van de Westhuizen were refused amnesty for failing to make full disclosure .
Colonel Taylor died before his amnesty hearing .
Applicants Radebe and Baker , who had not been present during the interrogation or involved in the disposal of the body , were granted amnesty for her abduction .
Mr Mbane did not apply for amnesty .
Château de MontribloudThe Château de Montribloud is a former castle in the &amp; quot ; commune &amp; quot ; of Saint-André-de-Corcy in the Ain &amp; quot ; département &amp; quot ; of France .
It was later transformed into a Renaissance château . The castle is constructed of brick , typical of the Dombes area . The origin of Montribloud is uncertain .
Some have derived the name of Montribloud from &amp; quot ; Mons terribilis &amp; quot ; ( terrible mount ) as the site of a battle in 197 BC between Clodius Albinus and Septimius Severus to become Roman Emperor .
Others suggest a Germanic origin , citing ancient transcriptions referring to &amp; quot ; Montribloz , Montriblou , Montriblout &amp; quot ; . The first proven historical mention of Montribloud is dated to 1299 .
In 1313 , Hugues Brun , canon of Lyon Cathedral , directed his heirs to found a monastery there .
In fact , Humbert V , lord of Thoire-Villars , built a castle on a mound during the 1320s .
On 21 February 1334 , Humbert V paid homage to the Dauphin du Viennois for the &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; donjon &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( keep ) of Montribloud .
Later , his son Humbert VI , did the same Amadeus VI , Count of Savoy in 1355 , following the joining of Dauphiné to France . On 31 October 1384 , Humbert VII of Thoire-Villars exchanged the territory of Beauvoir en Bugey with Eudes de Villars , seigneur of Montellier , his cousin , for the seigneurie of Montribloud including the parishes of Saint-André-de-Corcy , Civrieux , Bussiges and Saint-Marcel-en-Dombes . At the beginning of the 15th century , after the death without heirs of Eudes de Villars , Montribloud passed in 1418 to his grand-nephews , the sons of Jeanne de la Tour and of Jean de La Baume , Count of de Montrevel and Marshal of France .
It remained in this powerful Baume-Montrevel family until Antoine , who sold it in 1590 , to Martin and Jean de Covet , seigneurs of la Mure , rich merchant drapers originally from Bresse . The Covets transformed the castle , surrounded with ditches , into a Renaissance residence with mullioned windows .
On 8 August 1660 , Antoine de Covet , marquis de Villars , had the barony of Montibould established in the county .
Deeply in debt , his grandson Jean-Baptiste de Covet , was forced to sell the seigneurie of Montribloud to his creditor , Pierre Nicolau , alderman and treasurer of the town of Lyon .
on 24 January 1754 . Inheriting the château from his father , Christophe Nicolau engaged the celebrated Lyonnais urban architect Jean-Antoine Morand to rebuild the castle to his tastes .
The mound was enlarged , the castle was given a neoclassical plan and a French formal garden was created .
But , accused of having mixed his personal funds with those of the town of Lyon , he fled to Paris .
His son , Antoine Nicolau , gave it to the Lyonnais banker Melchior Bodin in 1826 .
His son , Alexandre Bodin ( 1804-1893 ) , who became &amp; quot ; député &amp; quot ; for l &amp; apos ; Ain and a member of the Corps Législatif under the Second Empire ) , transformed the appearance of the castle by introducing slate roofs , according to the fashion of the time , and remodelled the gardens in the English landscape style .
The present château has changed very little since then and still belongs to the Bodin family . The château is normally closed to the public .
During European Heritage Days , the Bodin family open the château to visitors . Guigue , Marie-Claude , &amp; quot ; Topographie historique du département de l &amp; apos ; Ain &amp; quot ; , 1873 .

Cantab Capital PartnersCantab Capital Partners is a hedge fund based in Cambridge , England , co-founded by Dr .
Ewan Kirk and Erich Schlaikjer .
Cantab operates quantitative funds using computer models to drive investment decisions .
As of Feb 2015 Cantab had $ 4 . 5 billion in assets under management , after launching with $ 30 million in 2006 .
The firm takes its name from Cantabrigia , the medieval Latin name for Cambridge .
It is regulated in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority .
Cantab Capital Partners was acquired by GAM in 2016 and is since part of GAM Systematic .
Cantab &amp; apos ; s stated investment philosophy is that algorithmic trading can help to overcome cognitive biases inherent in human-based trading decisions , by exploiting persistent statistical relationships between markets .
Taking a multi-asset , multi-model approach , the majority of Cantab &amp; apos ; s traded instruments are liquid futures and forwards , across currencies , fixed income , equity indices and commodities . Cantab manages two investment funds : the CCP Quantitative Programme ( launched 2007 , with $ 30m ) and the CCP Core Macro Programme ( launched 2013 ) .
Both are computer-based algorithmic trading systems , also known as automated trading , black-box trading , algo trading or systematic trading . In January 2013 , Goldman Sachs became a minor investor in Cantab .
Kirk is a former Goldman partner ; Schlaikjer is a former Managing Director and European Chief Technology Officer of Goldman &amp; apos ; s Quantitative Strategies Group .
Cantab is reported to have been granted access to Goldman &amp; apos ; s technology infrastructure . At the end of December 2014 Cantab &amp; apos ; s leading fund , the CCP Quantitative Fund , had gained 39 . 3 % over the previous 12 months .
The fund gained 13 percent over January 2015 alone .
These gains brought the fund to an annualized return of 11 . 38 percent since inception in March 2007 ; the Quantitative fund now has $ 3 . 5bn in assets under management .
The &amp; quot ; Financial Times &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; The Wall Street Journal &amp; quot ; reported that Cantab &amp; apos ; s 2014 results took place in the context of renewed investor interest in computer-traded funds and commodities-based funds . Cantab ’ s Core Macro Programme is notable for its fee structure , charging a 0 . 5 per cent management fee and 10 per cent of profits .
Industry-standard fees among hedge funds are often 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits .
Although algorithm-based hedge funds tend to offer lower fees , made possible by their technological infrastructure , &amp; quot ; The New York Times &amp; quot ; reported that Cantab had &amp; quot ; . . . lowered the fees to a point that not everybody can afford to do .
Some industry experts , such as Robert Leonard of Credit Suisse , believe that such commission levels are unsustainable . Cantab is largely staffed by mathematicians and scientists , many of whom have ties to nearby University of Cambridge .
In a 2013 interview with the &amp; quot ; Financial Times &amp; quot ; , Kirk said “ We have made a commitment to investors that we have no plans to be bigger than 80 professionals . &amp; quot ; In 2015 Cantab donated £ 5 million to launch the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information at Cambridge University .
The research institute will use mathematical science techniques to analyse data for application in fields such as medicine , meteorology , urban planning and financial risk analysis .
The Institute will have six lecturers and up to 18 Ph . D .
students . The Institute was set-up in order to address the lack of philanthropic funding for data research , and to stimulate cutting-edge research in the area .
In an interview with &amp; quot ; Pensions and Investments &amp; quot ; , Kirk said &amp; quot ; . . . it is much easier to get funding for medical science or computer science &amp; # 91 ; than for &amp; # 93 ; more theoretical subjects like mathematics ” .
Kirk also characterised the donation as &amp; quot ; philanthropic ” and that the firm plans to keep its research in-house , while maintaining a &amp; quot ; rewarding dialogue &amp; quot ; with the Institute .

F ! ( Philippine TV show ) F ! was a weekly lifestyle magazine show in the Philippines , which focuses on the latest fashion trends , best dining spots and how to live a social life , originally hosted by actress Angel Aquino , interior designer and model Daphne Osena-Paez and journalist Cher Calvin .
The trio became known as the F Girls .
However , when Calvin left the show for the States , supermodel Amanda Griffin joined the cast .
It premiered on ABS-CBN from April 17 , 1999 to February 26 , 2006 , becoming the longest-running lifestyle show of the network . On April 17 , 1999 , lifestyle show Citiline , which was then hosted by Cory Quirino , had to move to the newly opened subsidiary of ABS-CBN which happened to be Studio 23 .
The management needed a solution in order to fill the show &amp; apos ; s slot .
That &amp; apos ; s when they formulated the show entitled F which focused on the life of a woman and lifestyle .
It was planned to be hosted by Daphne Osena-Paez , then working at the News and Current Affairs division , but ABS-CBN managed to add actress Angel Aquino and newcomer Cher Calvin to the roster of hosts , where they became the trio called the F Girls . After the show &amp; apos ; s pilot year , the magazine show became a huge hit to all Filipinos .
What was even better is that Osena-Paez got to host another lifestyle show A Guide to Urban Living , which is also produced by ABS-CBN , but she didn &amp; apos ; t leave the show for she was having a good time being the host of F .
From then on , F became the longest-running and award-winning lifestyle show in the country because the trio gave exquisite tips on how to live a better city life , knowledge of trends , fashion and a whole lot more . In 2003 , one of the original hosts of the show Cher Calvin leaves the country to pursue a broadcasting career in the United States .
That leaves Aquino and Osena-Paez the original hosts .
During the latter part of the year , the show welcomes supermodel Amanda Griffin as the replacement for Calvin .
Once again , the trio became a huge hit on Philippine television . The show didn &amp; apos ; t last long because ratings started to low down .
F aired its last episode on February 26 , 2006 due to this cause .
The F girls decided to part ways after 7 years of working together , bringing Filipino viewers a different view in lifestyle programming .
However , Aquino didn &amp; apos ; t leave the hosting of lifestyle show as she hosted Us Girls with actresses Cheska Garcia and Iya Villania joining her as the main hosts . After F ceased airing , the girls became successful in their careers .
Angel Aquino became a successful actress and still continuing what she started at F as a lifestyle host .
Cher Calvin became a journalist in the United States at KTLA-TV .
Daphne Osena-Paez started her own business by selling furniture , became the host of lifestyle show Urban Zone in ABS-CBN and Amanda Griffin still continues being a model . In 2009 , the F girls were reunited once again after 10 years of working together in F .
They had interviews , photoshoots and even guest appearances on TV and radio .
ABS-CBN executives decided that the original F girls would do a comeback special as they reminisce the days they had working again .
The TV special was sponsored by Olay Total Effects Cream , which is also being advertised in the show .
F &amp; apos ; s Reunion episode was premiered September 27 , 2009 , one day after the destruction done by Typhoon Ondoy .
LSE approach to econometricsThe LSE approach to econometrics , named for the London School of Economics , involves viewing econometric models as &amp; quot ; reductions &amp; quot ; from some unknown data generation process ( DGP ) .
A complex DGP is typically modelled as the starting point and this complexity allows information in the data from the real world but absent in the theory to be drawn upon .
The complexity is then reduced by the econometrician by a series of restrictions which are tested . One particular functional form , the error-correction model , is often arrived at when modelling time series .
Denis Sargan and David Forbes Hendry ( with his general-to-specific modeling ) were key figures in the development of the approach and the one way the approach has been extended is through the work on integrated and cointegrated systems by Robert F .
Engle , Clive Granger , and Søren Johansen .
Another commonly used functional form is distributed lag or autoregressive distributed lag . David F .
Hendry is considered to be the principal architect of the LSE approach .
The methodology is often referred to as general-to-specific modelling , &amp; quot ; Gets modeling &amp; quot ; or &amp; quot ; Hendry &amp; apos ; s methodology &amp; quot ; . The software package OxMetrics implements this process via the PcGive module &amp; quot ; Autometrics &amp; quot ; In the 1970s , when the LSE approach was in its infancy , Edward E .
Leamer was an early critic of model discovery methodologies . The approach evolved to include : multiple reduction path searches , indicator saturation , COMFAC testing , and cointegrated vector autoregressive structures . Economists often associated with &amp; quot ; Hendry &amp; apos ; s methodology &amp; quot ; include Clive Granger , Robert F .
Engle , Søren Johansen , Grayham Mizon , Jennifer Castle , Hans M .
Krolzig , Neil Ericsson , and Jurgen Doornik .

Robert Johnson ( artist ) Robert Johnson ( 1770 – 1796 ) was an apprentice of Thomas Bewick in his Newcastle upon Tyne workshop .
Bewick taught him wood engraving , but discovered Johnson &amp; apos ; s talent for sketching in watercolour directly from nature . Born at Shotley Bridge , near Ovingham , Northumberland , he was son of a joiner and carpenter , who shortly afterwards removed to Gateshead .
Through his mother , who was acquainted with Thomas Bewick , Johnson was in 1788 apprenticed to Ralph Beilby and Bewick in Newcastle , to learn copperplate-engraving .
Johnson mainly occupied himself in sketching from nature in water-colours .
On the expiration of his apprenticeship , he abandoned engraving , and took up painting . Johnson died at Kenmore , Perthshire , on 26 October 1796 , in his twenty-sixth year .
He was buried in Ovingham churchyard , where a monument was erected to his memory by his friends . Johnson made most of the drawings for Bewick &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Fables &amp; quot ; .
His drawings for William Bulmer &amp; apos ; s edition of Oliver Goldsmith &amp; apos ; s and Thomas Parnell &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Poems &amp; quot ; were cut by Thomas and John Bewick , and published in 1795 . A drawing by Johnson of Newcastle Cathedral was engraved in wood by Charlton Nesbit ; Johnson made a small copperplate engraving from the same drawing for the publisher , Joseph Whitfield of Newcastle .
Having fallen out with Whitfield , he engraved three caricatures of him . Johnson was employed by Messrs .
Morison of Perth to copy the portraits by George Jamesone at Taymouth Castle , the seat of the Earl of Breadalbane , for reproduction in John Pinkerton &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Iconographia Scotica &amp; quot ; .
Two drawings by him were engraved by Charles Warren , as illustrations to John Gay &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Fables &amp; quot ; and Ossian &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Poems &amp; quot ; .
Yosef MizrachiYosef Mizrachi ( ) is a Sefardi Haredi rabbi and founder of DivineInformation . com , an Orthodox Judaism outreach organization , based in Monsey , New York . Yosef Mizrachi was born in 1968 in Israel .
After his mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces he worked in finance in New York City .
In 1994 , Mizrachi began dedicating himself to Orthodox Judaism outreach , and in 1997 , Mizrachi left his professional career and began learning and teaching Torah at Yeshivat Ohr Yisrael in Monsey . Mizrachi discussed his Semikhah ( rabbinical ordination ) credentials in a January 9 , 2016 radio interview with Zev Brenner .
When asked if he has Semikhah , Mizrachi stated that he lacks such Semikhah which involves testing and is common among Synagogue rabbis .
However , Mizrachi went on to explain that he has received certification in recognition of his Torah background by Rabbi Eliyahu Ben Haim qualifying him to be a rabbi . Mizrachi founded a Kiruv organization in 1995 .
The organization provides free DVDs , Audio CDs , and MP3 CDs , sponsored by donors .
As of 2013 , the organization has handed out thousands of these audio and video disks .
Mizrachi offers an extended ethical audio and video lecture series , called &amp; quot ; The Path of the Just &amp; quot ; , based on the musar text Mesillat Yesharim composed by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto . In 2001 Mizrachi opened a Kolel and a Yeshiva in Alfandari Street , Jerusalem . In 2002 a movie called &amp; quot ; Divine Information &amp; quot ; was produced by Mizrahi and Yuval Ovadia .
Two years later , in 2004 , Mizrachi launched the &amp; quot ; DivineInformation . com &amp; quot ; website posting many of his video and audio lectures . In early 2014 , before a lecture tour in London , concern was expressed about statements by Mizrachi in his previous lectures relating to the behaviour of secular and religious Jews during the Holocaust suggesting that Down &amp; apos ; s Syndrome and autism are &amp; quot ; punishments for sins committed in a previous life &amp; quot ; and among others .
Mizrachi was criticized for his views while he explicitly maintains are &amp; quot ; Torah sourced . &amp; quot ; His views also include lectures using Bible Codes to &amp; quot ; explain &amp; quot ; the Holocaust .
As a result , at least one of his planned lectures in London was initially cancelled . In December 2015 , in one of his lectures , Mizrahi claimed that it is possible that only one million Jews died in The Holocaust as opposed to the well accepted figure of 6 million , since many of them were not Jewish according to Jewish law which requires a person &amp; apos ; s mother to be Jewish .
Mizrahi was criticized by academics and Jewish leaders including Efraim Zuroff , director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center , who said that he &amp; quot ; made up history to suit an agenda . &amp; quot ; He was also criticized by Berel Wein who stated that &amp; quot ; It is too damaging a matter to be left unanswered and unrefuted . &amp; quot ; Later Mizrahi issued an apology .
According to The Times , Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis has spoken out against the travel plans of this &amp; quot ; Jewish hate preacher &amp; quot ; ; and the UK Home Office has suggested that the Home Secretary , Amber Rudd , was considering banning Mizrahi should he apply to visit Britain . A meeting with Dr .
Katz and Rabbi Mizrachi concluded the controversy about the holocaust , when Rabbi Mizrachi met with the holocaust survivor .
Rav Mizrachi publicly apologized to Dr .
Katz , the other Jewish Nation survivors , and victims of the holocaust .
Dr .
katz told Rav Mizrachi that his apology was accepted chiefly because of the Rabbi &amp; apos ; s quick response to his invitation . In December 2016 , 16 prominent US rabbis issued an open letter about Mizrachi .
They said that Mizrachi &amp; quot ; reduce &amp; # 91 ; s &amp; # 93 ; complex issues to simplistic and misleading sound bites , &amp; quot ; and his assertions are &amp; quot ; objectionable , and even dangerous . &amp; quot ; The letter continued that institutions should be more &amp; quot ; discerning &amp; quot ; with the guests they invite .

Minister of Health v New Clicks : in re Application for Declaratory ReliefMinister of Health &amp; amp ; another v New Clicks SA ( Pty ) Ltd &amp; amp ; others : in re Application for Declaratory Relief is an important case in South African law , with significance especially in the areas of civil procedure and constitutional law . The Supreme Court of Appeal ( SCA ) had set aside regulations relating to a transparent pricing system for medicines and scheduled substances .
The Minister of Health sought leave to appeal against that decision to the Constitutional Court .
As a result of the application , both parties published conflicting statements about its effect .
Members of the Department of Health made various remarks in the media to the effect that the filing of the application for leave to appeal had the effect of suspending the order of the SCA .
Furthermore , the regulations were valid ; stakeholders were expected to comply with them .
Representatives of the pharmaceutical industry , the respondents , retaliated with a press statement to the effect that the mere lodging of an application for leave to appeal does not suspend the order of the SCA . As a result of the conflicting statements , the Minister launched this application for declaratory relief to the effect that the SCA order had been automatically suspended by the application for leave to appeal .
Together with their answering affidavit the respondents lodged a conditional counter-application .
The thrust of their opposition was that the question of declaratory relief was not incidental to the main relief sought ( that is , leave to appeal ) , and that the application should properly be considered as direct access . The court held that the application was in substance an application for direct access .
The court had stressed on more than one occasion that applications for direct access should be granted only in exceptional circumstances .
In effect the Minister was asking for an order to suspend the declaration of invalidity .
This is an order that should be made , as the Constitution contemplates in section 172 ( 1 ) ( b ) , by the court making the declaration of invalidity .
In this case , the order could have been made by the SCA .
It was best placed to determine what was just and equitable in the circumstances . The application for direct access was therefore dismissed .

Museum of Lavra SchoolThe Museum of Lavra School is an ethnographical museum located in Lavra , Portugal . The museum displays objects which were common in the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and characterizes the way of life of the population of the village in those ancient times . The museum is organized according to the production cycles and experiences .
It starts with the country house , which was the basis of all social structure , and then presents all the set of patent cores in the museum collection . The country house is a unit composed by three elements : the built part , the productive complex and the family .
People are identified by the house they own , which also defines the social status .
The status implies obligations and duties , as well as obtained benefits on the use of what is common , such as water and wastelands . In the country house , the kitchen is the place where all the family life happens .
The kitchen can be a ground or a wooden compartment , forming a separated room .
Here we can find the fireplace , receive who comes for a visit and prepare and have meals in family or with those who work for the house .
In the fireplace the boilers with meat are kept and , in the oven , bread baking is weekly prepared .
Around the fireplace , surrounded by heat and light , people spent the evenings , spinning linen or wool , while listening to songs and telling stories . Sometimes isolated , this home is structured to meet the needs of exploring the farm .
It may consist of buildings arranged around a central space , patio , made up by housing , livestock , pigsty , chicken coop , rabbit hutches and stores where farm implements and crops are kept and where there is the mill , the winery and the distillery .
The farmyard is the farming space , where are the oxen cars , the cereals cleaner , the seed drill and the agricultural implements . The linen should be sown in March , in the beginning of the Spring season .
In the Summer , the harvest is done – people pull out the linen , to make good use the textile fiber , which is found in the stalk .
Then , we must hackle the linen , which consist of taking of the seed with the “ ripo ” ( a comb made of iron ) .
The next action is to soak – the linen stays for two weeks in current but not very strong water .
Then , it will dry in a previously cut and cleaned field .
The linen balls are placed on the field .
Once dry , the linen is scutched .
This action is made in “ espadeladouro ” , with a flax-comb ( a wooden board and a hive ( cylinder made of cork ) .
The purpose is to separate the fibres .
The linters are taken out ( rough , thick and short fibre , which is also used to make some kind cloth , like mattress liners , kitchen rags and flour sacs ) .
The fibre that remains , after the separation of the linters , is put in a machine , which repeatedly tramples the linen in the river .
The linen can also be made with a maul .
In this way the linen is squeezed .
Now it is time to go to the next step , which consists of putting the fibre that remained in a machine that softens the linen and makes it glossy , separating the linen from the cotton waste ( that remains trapped inside the machine making the linen become finer ) .
The linen is now ready to be sharpened .
For its spinning , the distaff and the spinning wheel are used , turning the fibre into thread .
One of the most popular crafts in Lavra was blacksmithing craft .
Nowadays , there are few blacksmiths who still work with traditional forge and are usually old people .
This craftsmanship , as most of the offices in the old times , was transmitted from parents to children .
It was an activity that was perpetuated in the family with obvious advantages : there were workshops and tools , requiring no additional investments .
Only the art of knowing how to do … Nowadays , that art is a thing of the past as industrialization has replaced the small craftsmanship . The cereal mill , another structure once essential and widely used in Lavra , was generally of collective use and was near a watercourse , as for example , near the rio Onda . Fishing is another traditional activity strongly established in Lavra .
As a complement to the agricultural activity , the people of the household participated in this activity , either directly or indirectly : the fishermen , the gulfweeth gatherer , the carters , jobs done by women and other family members .
This was a very strong religious activity .

Anarkali Salwar SuitAnarkali Shalwar suit is a form of women &amp; apos ; s dress originating from the city of Lahore in Pakistan .
The Anarkali suit is made up of a long , frock-style top and features a slim fitted bottom .
The Anarkali suit varies in many different lengths and embroideries including floor-length Anarkali styles . Anarkali suits owe their name to the fictional Anarkali , a courtesan in the court of Mughal emperor Akbar who was legendarily murdered for her illicit relationship with the Crown Prince Salim , who would later become the Emperor Jahangir . The word Anarkali literally means the ‘ delicate bud of the pomegranate flower / tree ’ .
This name signifies the qualities of softness , vulnerability , innocence , and beauty associated with the women who wore Anarkalis . The majestic Anarkali suit ensemble is quite popular in Pakistan and many other South East Asian communities .
It generally consists of 3 separates – a fitted till waist and then flared long kurta / top-wear , a churidaar ( fitted ) bottom and a dupatta / stole .
The graceful Anarkali suit finds its roots in the Mughal and Persian cultures .
The various forms of the regal Anarakali silhouette are also related to the Indian culture in many ways .
The Indian Angarakha is very similar to Anarkali and is closely associated with the Indian classical dance form Kathak .
In fact , Anarkali tends to be the regular costume of the dancers , practicing the Kathak form of the Lucknow Gharana .
Anna Maria PicarelliAnna Maria Picarelli ( born November 4 , 1984 ) is an American-born Italian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Seattle Sounders Women and the Italian national team . Picarelli is an Italian American , born in Downey , California ; her father Angelo Picarelli and uncle Joe Picarelli both became restaurateurs in Long Beach .
Her paternal grandparents Mario and Maria Picarelli had migrated from Calabria to Downey in 1966 . As a senior in her successful four-year career playing varsity soccer at Pepperdine University , Picarelli was called into a training camp for the United States women &amp; apos ; s national under-23 soccer team .
However , coach Jill Ellis quickly deemed Picarelli too small to be an effective goalkeeper at international level . After graduating Picarelli approached Italian club Bardolino Verona who signed her after a very short trial .
She played for Bardolino in a 3 – 3 UEFA Women &amp; apos ; s Champions League draw with Arsenal Ladies and caught the eye of Italy women &amp; apos ; s national football team manager Pietro Ghedin . In January 2008 Picarelli made her debut for Italy in a 1 – 0 friendly defeat in France .

Minister of Health v New ClicksNew Clicks South Africa ( Pty ) Ltd v Tshabalala-Msimang and Another NNO ; Pharmaceutical Society of South Africa and Others v Tshabalala-Msimang and Another NNO 2005 ( 2 ) SA 530 ( C ) is an important case in South African administrative law .
However , note that this case went on appeal , first to the Supreme Court of Appeal and thereafter to the Constitutional Court , where the various judgments of Chaskalson , Ngcobo , Sachs , Moseneke and others had far-reaching effects on administrative law in South Africa .
This article discusses the first hearing of this matter in the Cape Provincial Division .
The final judgment is listed on SAFLII as &amp; quot ; Minister of Health and Another v New Clicks South Africa ( Pty ) Ltd and Others &amp; quot ; ( CCT 59 / 2004 ) &amp; # 91 ; 2005 &amp; # 93 ; ZACC 14 . The applicants sought the review and setting aside of a recommendation made by the Pricing Committee , and of regulations made pursuant to the Medicines and Related Substances Act .
The regulations dealt with a new pricing system for medicines in South Africa , as well as dispensing fees and wholesale pricing .
The Pricing Committee had taken representations on behalf of interested parties .
After this process , it made recommendations to the first respondent in the form of draft regulations .
These were then published as final regulations . The first question before the court was whether or not the conduct of the Pricing Committee constituted administrative action .
Yekiso J , for the majority , began his analysis as follows : For the conduct of the Pricing Committee to constitute an administrative action as against the applicants , there ought to exist an administrative law relationship based on authoritative power .
This relationship encompasses an element of subordination on the object of such administrative law relationship which , in the instance of these proceedings , ought to be the applicants .
Use of the authoritative power presupposes the administrative law relationship between the organ of state , as the subject of the administrative law relationship and the object , which could either be an individual or a group of individuals as the objects of such relationship . Yekiso J then referred to section 33 of the Constitution and the definition section of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act ( PAJA ) and continued as follows : In terms of this definition conduct , in order to constitute administrative action as defined , has to have a direct , external legal effect and has to adversely affect rights of the individual or a group .
On the face of it , it would appear that the definition of administrative action in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act limits the scope of administrative action in section 33 of the Constitution .
Whether such limitation conforms to the requirements of the limitation clause in section 36 of the Constitution and thus passes muster , does not call for determination in these proceedings .
From this definition , the following elements of the term administrative action emerge , namely : For the conduct of the Pricing Committee to be subject to review in terms of section 6 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act it has to embody all the elements enumerated in the preceding paragraph failing which the conduct complained of cannot be subject to review in terms of the Promotion of Just Administrative Act .
If the conduct of the Pricing Committee does not fall within the ambit of the definition of administrative action contained in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act , the issue which will then call for determination is whether the conduct of the Pricing Committee is beyond judicial review .
All these issues will be determined in the course of this judgment .
To revert to the Pricing Committee , it will be recalled that it is a committee that was appointed and established in terms of section 22G ( 1 ) of the Act .
Its mandate was to formulate recommendations which , if accepted , would enable the first respondent to make regulations relating to the introduction of a transparent pricing system for all medicines and Scheduled substances sold in the Republic and , on an appropriate dispensing fee to be charged by a pharmacist or by a person licensed in terms of section 22G ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Act .
In line with its mandate the committee did formulate the required recommendations which it submitted to the first respondent for acceptance .
It was for the first respondent to either accept or reject the recommendations as formulated .
It is these recommendations which are the subject of a challenge by the applicants on the basis that the conduct of the Pricing Committee , in going about fulfilling its functions in the formulation of the recommendations , constitutes an administrative action within the meaning of the term as contemplated in section 1 of the Promotion of Just Administrative Act . For the conduct of the Pricing Committee to constitute an administrative action within the meaning of that term in terms of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act , not only should it fall within the ambit of that definition , but , at the very least , it will have to contain those elements I have set out in paragraph &amp; # 91 ; 35 &amp; # 93 ; of this judgment .
The most important of these elements are , in my view , that the recommendations should adversely affect rights and should have a direct external legal effect .
I venture to suggest at this stage that such conduct or action should affect the rights of the person concerned directly rather than indirectly .
Once the recommendations were formulated and submitted to the first respondent for acceptance , at that stage , that is prior to acceptance thereof by the first respondent , they did not affect any one of the applicants &amp; apos ; existing rights or legitimate expectations directly .
Such recommendations did not have any force or effect on any one of the applicants .
These were mere recommendations .
They were not binding on the applicants and thus could not be construed as having had any direct , external legal effect .
The applicants did not feel any effect of the recommendations . The recommendations , prior to the acceptance thereof by the first respondent , did not impose any burden on the applicants nor did they , at that stage , remove rights from any one of the applicants .
Even if one were to accept that the Pricing Committee is an organ of state , in my view , it can hardly be conceivable that the formulation of the recommendations which can only have a final effect once promulgated into regulation could be said to constitute exercise of public power .
The direct , legal effect contemplated in the definition of administrative action cannot be conditional , in the sense of pending acceptance by the first respondent .
In my view , and on the grounds set out in this and the preceding paragraph alone , the conduct and the activities of the Pricing Committee can hardly be construed as constituting an administrative action nor do such activities fall within the ambit of the definition of administrative action as defined in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act .
Furthermore , for the activities of the Pricing Committee to constitute administrative action , such conduct , in terms of the definition of administrative action , should have , in as far as the applicants are concerned , a &amp; quot ; direct legal effect . &amp; quot ; For any action to have a direct effect , it obviously must affect the person concerned directly rather than indirectly .
Some writers , in particular , de Ville are of the view that direct effect requires finality in the administration of rights , which would exclude preliminary steps in multi-staged decisions .
This would include the making of reports prior to decisions and any conduct preparatory to the taking of a decision .
As regards the term legal effect , what this in my view would entail to is that the administrative action or decision must be a legally binding determination of individual rights .
In other words , the recommendations , to constitute an administrative action , must either establish , change or withdraw existing rights .
The recommendations of the Committee do not have any of these attributes .
The principles of administrative justice apply to administrative action only and the Committee &amp; apos ; s recommendations fall short of this . To the extent that the applicants seek to have the recommendations to be reviewed and set aside in terms of the provisions of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act , the applicants &amp; apos ; challenge on this ground cannot succeed for the simple reason that the conduct of the Committee , culminating in the recommendations , does not constitute an administrative action within the meaning of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act . Having found , however , that the recommendation could not be reviewed in terms of PAJA , Yekiso J held that the recommendation was nevertheless reviewable in terms of the common law and section 33 of the Constitution .
He then turned to consider whether the passing of the regulations themselves fell under the definition section of the PAJA : The making of regulations , which clearly is a legislative administrative action , as against judicial and pure administrative action , is not specifically referred to in the definition of the term &amp; quot ; decision &amp; quot ; in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act .
Could it therefore be said that &amp; quot ; rule making &amp; quot ; was deliberately left out of the definition of the term &amp; quot ; decision &amp; quot ; and if so , whether it was the intention of the legislature not to include &amp; quot ; rule making &amp; quot ; in the definition of administrative action ? The making of regulations , the subsequent promulgation and the enforcement of such regulations govern the general administrative law relationship as against the individual administrative law relationship .
The former is what would constitute &amp; quot ; administrative action affecting the public &amp; quot ; as contemplated in section 4 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act .
This obviously would entail the making and promulgation of such regulation by following the procedure as provided for in section 4 ( 1 ) of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act .
Following the procedure as laid down in section 4 ( 1 ) of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act would obviously be preceded by a decision to follow that procedure .
A decision to follow that procedure would constitute a decision taken in terms of section 4 ( 1 ) of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act .
Now , the taking of a decision or failure to take a decision in terms of section 4 ( 1 ) has been specifically excluded from the definition of the administrative action . Could it be that the omission to refer to legislative administrative action in the definition of the term &amp; quot ; decision &amp; quot ; in section 1 , and the specific exclusion of taking a decision or failure to take a decision in terms of section 4 ( 1 ) , is a pointer or an indication of an intention to exclude &amp; quot ; rule making &amp; quot ; from the ambit of administrative action ? In my view the legislature could not have intended otherwise .
In short , my view is that it was not the intention of the legislature to include rule making in the definition of and in the ambit of administrative action as defined in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act .
To the extent that rule making could be construed as the implementation of national legislation as contemplated in section 85 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution , the latter section of the Constitution provides &amp; quot ; in implementing national legislation except where the Constitution or an Act of Parliament provides otherwise &amp; quot ; .
In the instance of this matter the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act , which is an Act of Parliament , provides otherwise . Once again , I must re-iterate , the fact that rule making does not constitute administrative action , does not render the regulations themselves to be beyond judicial scrutiny .
The regulations are subject to review on the basis of the principle of legality , the principles of common law to the extent such common law principles are not inconsistent with the Constitution , the provisions of section 33 ( 1 ) of the Constitution and other relevant provisions of the Constitution .
I am making these observations mindful of what was said by the Constitutional Court in &amp; quot ; Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of SA and Another : In Re Ex Parte President of the Republic of South Africa and Others &amp; quot ; that the control of public power is always a constitutional matter . Yekiso J considered this question later in the judgment and said as follows : I have already determined in paragraph &amp; # 91 ; 49 &amp; # 93 ; of this judgment that the Regulations do not constitute an administrative act within the meaning of the term as defined in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act .
I made this determination well aware of the remarks by O &amp; apos ; Regan J in &amp; quot ; Bato Star Fishing ( Pty ) Ltd v The Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and Others &amp; quot ; where the learned Justice said : &amp; quot ; The grundnorm of administrative law is now to be found in the first place not in the doctrine of &amp; quot ; ultra vires &amp; quot ; , nor in the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty nor in the common law itself , but in the principles of our Constitution .
The common law informs the principles of Paja and the Constitution and derives its force from the latter .
The extent to which the common law remains relevant to administrative review will have to be developed on a case by case basis as the courts interpret and apply the provisions of PAJA and the Constitution . &amp; quot ; I made this determination also well aware of the remarks by the Constitutional Court in &amp; quot ; Minister of Home Affairs v Eisenberg &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; 2003 ( 8 ) BCLR 838 ( CC ) at paras 52 and 53 &amp; # 93 ; that , in that matter , it was not necessary to consider causes of action for judicial review of administrative action that do not fall within the scope of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act .
The Regulations which are the subject of this review , as I have already determined , do not fall within the scope of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act .
I re-iterate that the Regulations in question are susceptible to review on the basis of the principle of legality and other provisions of the Constitution in particular , the administrative justice clause . In a minority judgment , Traverso DJP also considered whether the recommendations and the regulations constituted administrative action .
Unlike Yekiso J , Traverso DJP found that the recommendation did constitute administrative action within the definition section of the PAJA .
She reasoned as follows : One of the issues raised is whether the making of recommendations by the Pricing Committee is reviewable under PAJA .
&amp; # 91 ; Counsel for the first respondent &amp; # 93 ; submitted that the recommendation of the pricing committee is not reviewable because it is neither an &amp; quot ; administrative action &amp; quot ; nor a &amp; quot ; decision &amp; quot ; as defined in PAJA .
He argued that the &amp; quot ; recommendation &amp; quot ; of the Pricing Committee is purely advisory in nature , and therefore does not fall within the definition of a decision as contained in Section 1 ( v ) of PAJA .
I agree with &amp; # 91 ; counsel for the first respondent &amp; # 93 ; that the recommendation of the Pricing Committee is not covered by those &amp; quot ; decisions &amp; quot ; listed in Section 1 ( v ) ( a ) - ( f ) of PAJA .
Section 1 ( v ) ( g ) is more problematical .
Its wording is much wider and it is a typical &amp; quot ; catch all &amp; quot ; provision .
&amp; # 91 ; Counsel for the first respondent &amp; # 93 ; however argued that the words &amp; quot ; any other act . . .
of an administrative nature &amp; quot ; should be interpreted restrictively and with reference to the kinds of decisions listed in paragraphs 1 ( v ) ( a ) - ( f ) .
For this submission he relied on the &amp; quot ; ejusdem generis &amp; quot ; principle , as there is a distinct &amp; quot ; genus &amp; quot ; of decisions listed under this definition .
I cannot agree .
Firstly the wording of this sub-section makes it plain that the actions listed in Section 1 ( v ) ( a ) - ( g ) are not exhaustive .
This was conceded by &amp; # 91 ; counsel for the first respondent &amp; # 93 ; .
Secondly , there is nothing in the wording of Section 1 ( v ) ( g ) which indicates that the words &amp; quot ; any other act or thing of an administrative nature &amp; quot ; refers to only acts or things belonging to a certain &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; genus &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
PAJA was specifically enacted to give effect to the constitutional right of citizens to just administrative action .
This relates to all forms of administrative action and not just a restrictive &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; genus &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; of acts of an administrative nature .
( See &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; , 2000 ( 2 ) SA 674 CC ; JR de Ville : Judicial Review of Administrative Action in South Africa at p .
39 . ) The Pricing Committee was appointed to make recommendations .
As I will show later it is not in dispute that these recommendations are a jurisdictional prerequisite for the making of recommendations .
It is in my view clear that the recommendations could adversely affect not only the rights of members of the pharmaceutical industry but also the rights of consumers , and therefore the public at large .
When the Committee considered the public comment in formulating their recommendations they were clearly performing a function which was of an administrative nature .
I am therefore satisfied that the word &amp; quot ; decision &amp; quot ; does not have the narrow meaning contended for by the Respondents .
The next point to consider is whether the recommendations of the Pricing Committee would have a &amp; quot ; direct external legal effect &amp; quot ; .
From the wording of Section 22G ( 2 ) , it is clear that the making of a recommendation by the Committee is a specific and separate requirement for the making of the regulations , because it is only upon the recommendation of the Pricing Committee that the Minister can make the Regulations .
That being so , and for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph , it follows that the recommendations must ultimately have a direct external legal effect .
These recommendations are not mere preliminary determinations , investigative actions or intermediate steps , which the legislature intended to exclude from the definition of administrative action .
( See Currie &amp; amp ; Klaaren : Promotion of Administrative Justice Act Benchbook at 44-45 ) On the contrary the recommendations are upon promulgation transformed into the regulations &amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; I am &amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; satisfied that a valid recommendation by the Pricing Committee is a jurisdictional requirement for valid regulations .
Valid recommendations entail at least 3 elements : ( a ) A recommendation made by the Pricing Committee , and not by any other person or entity ; ( b ) A fair procedure must be adopted and sustained by the Pricing Committee in its meetings ; ( c ) A proper application of the mind by a duly constituted Pricing Committee to all representations made to it . These are in my view all matters which fall squarely within the definition contained in Section 1 ( v ) ( g ) namely &amp; quot ; any other act of an administrative nature &amp; quot ; . Traverso DJP then turned to the question of whether or not the passing of the regulations also constituted administrative action within the definition as provided by the AJA .
She wrote , ( para 44 — 58 ) PAJA excludes the executive powers and functions of the National Executive under Section 85 ( 2 ) ( b ) - ( e ) of the Constitution from the definition of administrative action .
It is however important to note that the powers and functions of the National Executive under Section 85 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution are not excluded .
They are : &amp; quot ; 85 ( 2 ) The President exercises the executive authority , together with other members of the Cabinet by — ( a ) implementing national legislation . . . &amp; quot ; The implementation of national legislation therefore falls under the definition of administrative action .
In my view this provides a strong indication that the making of Regulations falls within the definition of administrative action as contained in PAJA .
Section 33 ( 1 ) of the Constitution provides that everyone has the right to administrative action that is lawful , reasonable and procedurally fair .
Section 33 ( 3 ) provides that national legislation must be enacted to give effect to those rights .
If the definition of administrative action in PAJA has to be given the narrow meaning contended for on behalf of the First Respondent , it would in my view follow that PAJA will not pass constitutional muster as it will then not give effect to Section 33 ( 1 ) of the Constitution .
It would rather than give effect to the Bill of Rights , and in particular to Section 33 thereof , limit an individual &amp; apos ; s right to lawful , reasonable and procedurally fair administrative action .
Such an interpretation must be avoided in favour of one which conforms to the Constitution .
See &amp; quot ; National Director of Public Prosecutions v .
Mohamed N . O &amp; quot ; , 2002 ( 4 ) SA 843 CC at 856 A-C .
I therefore conclude that both the recommendations and the Regulations are subject to judicial review .
The grounds of judicial review have now been codified by Section 6 of PAJA , and therefore if PAJA applies to the Regulations the review grounds must be located within Section 6 of PAJA ( &amp; quot ; Bato Star Fishing ( Pty ) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism &amp; quot ; 2004 ( 7 ) BCLR 687 CC at 705 B-D ) .
But as I have stated before , even if I am wrong in my conclusion that PAJA applies to the rule-making , then the Regulations may be challenged on the basis of the conventional grounds under the Constitution referred to above .
Kennett ( surname ) Kennett is a surname .
Notable people with the surname include :
RAF Amarda RoadRAF Amarda Road is a former wartime Royal Air Force ( RAF ) airfield located near Rasgovindpur village in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha , India . The Amarda Road airstrip , as it was called in war terminology , spreads across an area of nearly 600 acres .
Built in the 1940s at a cost of Rs 3 crore , it was eventually abandoned after the war .
It was probably named as Amarda Road Airfield because of the nearby Amarda Road railway station .
The airfield was used by No .
136 Squadron RAF , No .
177 Squadron RAF and No .
607 Squadron RAF .
The &amp; apos ; Air Fighting Training Unit &amp; apos ; , formed in February 1943 , was also based here . As an airfield , Amarda Road fell on the supply route for the Nationalist Armies of China in their fight against the Japanese .
Aircraft of the RAF and the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) would regularly fly from this space to China via Chabua ( Dibrugarh ) , Jorhat and Vijaynagar across the infamous hump route over Arunachal and East Tibet . Amarda Road and other neighbouring airfields - Dalbhumgarh , Dudhkundi , Salua , Digri , Salbani and Chakulia - formed a web of airfields created by the Allies to stop the impending Japanese advance in the east .
During the war , Amarda Road was , to put it simply , a battle hub .
After the war was over , most airfields , including this one , fell into disuse .
Today , only the Kalaikunda airstrip , which was declared an Air Force Station in 1954 , exists . Seven decades after the base was built , the concrete runway is still intact , though the buildings that once cluttered the edges are gone .
Sofia GiatsintovaSofia Vladimirovna Giatsintova ( , August 4 ( July 23 , o . s . ) , 1895 , - April 12 , 1982 ) was a Russian , Soviet film and theatre actress , who worked in the Moscow Art Theatre ( 1910-1937 ) , the Lenkom Theatre ( 1938-1957 , 1961-1982 , where she was the artistic director in 1951-1957 ) , and the Moscow Stanislavsky Drama Theatre ( 1958-1960 ) .
Sofia Giatsintova , the People &amp; apos ; s Artist of the USSR ( 1955 ) , received the USSR State Prize ( 1947 , for her part of Varvara Mikhaylovna in the film &amp; quot ; The Vow &amp; quot ; , 1946 ) , as well as numerous state awards , among them the Order of Lenin ( 1965 , 1975 ) .
She is the author of the book of memoirs &amp; quot ; Alone With Memories &amp; quot ; ( С памятью наедине , 1985 ) . Sofia Giatsintova was born in 1895 to a noble family from Moscow .
Her father Vladimir Giatsintov was the Moscow University professor ; after 1914 he became the director of the Moscow University Fine Arts museum .
Her mother Elizaveta Alexeyevna Giatsintova ( née Vekstern ) was connected to the renowned Chaadayev family .
Sofia remembered her childhood as a happy one .
The family adored theatre ; Vladimir Giatsintov was a member of the Moscow Shakespearean Society and an amateur playwright .
Even as a gymnasium student Sofia decided she &amp; apos ; d be an actress and started to take lessons from Elena Muratova , the actress of the Moscow Art Theatre , and in summer 1910 joined its troupe . In MAT Giatsintova became part of the active group of young actors , among them Evgeny Vakhtangov , Mikhail Chekhov , Serafima Birman , which soon became known as the MAT ’ s First Studio and later Second Moscow Art Theatre .
Among her best known parts there were those of Maria in Shakespeare &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; The Twelfth Night &amp; quot ; ( 1917 , 1933 ) , Sima ( &amp; quot ; Crank &amp; quot ; , by Alexander Afinogenov , 1929 ) , Nelly ( &amp; quot ; Humiliated and Insulted &amp; quot ; by Fyodor Dostoyevsky , 1932 ) .
In 1924 she married Ivan Bersenev , the theatre &amp; apos ; s actor and later artistic director .
In 1936 , as MAT 2 closed , Giatsintova ( along with Bersenev and Birman ) moved to the Lenkom Theatre which she became the head of in 1952 . In 1946 Giatsintova starred in Mikhail Chiaureli &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; The Vow &amp; quot ; as Varvara Petrovna , a woman who travels to Moscow on foot to give the beloved Vladimir Ilyich Lenin the letter written by common people , only to find that the great revolutionary leader has just died .
She finds herself on the Red Square and gives the letter to Iosif Stalin instead , right after he &amp; apos ; s proclaimed his allegiance to the Lenin &amp; apos ; s cause , speaking at the funeral .
The film brought Giatsintova the Stalin Prize , but hasn &amp; apos ; t been seen much of after the Soviet dictator &amp; apos ; s death in 1953 . In 1955 Giatsintova was honoured with the title People &amp; apos ; s Artist of the USSR .
Her acclaimed book of memoirs &amp; quot ; Alone With Memories &amp; quot ; ( С памятью наедине ) came out in 1985 .
Sofia Giatsintova died on April 12 , 1982 , in Moscow .
She is interred in Novodevichye Cemetery .

ADGB Trade Union SchoolThe ADGB Trade Union School ( Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes ( ADGB ) ) , is a complex of teaching and administrative buildings in Berlin bei Bernau , Germany , constructed for the former Federation of German Trade Unions .
It was designed by the Bauhaus architect Hannes Meyer with his partner Hans Wittwer between 1928 – 1930 , at which time Meyer was the director of the Bauhaus school in Dessau . The former ADGB School is a preeminent example of Bauhaus-designed architecture . Next to the Bauhaus school buildings in Dessau , it was the second largest project ever undertaken by the Bauhaus . The ADGB required a facility to educate and train members of the union in a variety of areas including labour law , industry , management and economics .
The complex included on-site accommodation and catering for trainees , and sports facilities . The architecture reflects the teachings intrinsic to the Bauhaus ideologies and is a pragmatic example of functional architecture .
The functionality taking precedence over anything else , the school was stripped back of any unnecessary decoration .
Meyer &amp; apos ; s design is composed of separate , individual structures that come together cohesively in the surrounding landscape .
The design came directly from the functional diagrams that Meyer had developed where all the lounges are oriented towards the landscape and the nearby lake . The overall complex is difficult to comprehend and can only be properly understood from the air , which is a similar execution to Walter Gropius &amp; apos ; Bauhaus in Dessau .
Each separately functioning building is positioned to form a Z-shape . The reception building bears a resemblance to the entrance of a factory site , which keeps in line with the purely functionalist design .
There are three chimneys which constitute the heating system and are accompanied by a block-like cube of the auditorium , creating a dominating entrance scene to the complex .
Immediately behind the entrance are the public buildings , positioned to create a square plan , which is exacerbated by the square auditorium in the middle .
This form is intended to create an expression of unity , the unity of a community .
The auditorium is a windowless room , the strong introversion allowing maximum concentration on the action .
Sophisticated technology supported the lecturers : A push-button would reduce the light band and dim the lights , while all three wall elements at the front hung with maps and graphs were moveable . Around the auditorium lined the administration building to the west , while south and east was the kitchen , dining room , sun room and recreation rooms together .
The restrooms were opposite to the auditorium .
All of these facilities were designed so that they allowed a digression of thought , and a relaxation of the mind . The remaining facilities can be accessed by a covered glass transition corridor , accentuated with red-coloured steel .
Five residential wings are lined to the south giving a clear view to the landscape in the north .
The course follows the terrain profile and thus has a slope of five meters .
The recessed edges of the accommodation wings form niches that serve as communication nooks and lounges .
Meyer created not only a development , but also a public space that can be used in rainy weather as a movement zone .
Each housing unit had a colour ( e . g .
red ) assigned to each floor and was then differentiated further once on the floor ( e . g . , carmine , vermilion , pink ) . In keeping with the Bauhaus philosophy of teaching via practical experience and working with industry , students were involved with this project , notably two women students . Margaretha Reichardt ( 1907 – 1984 ) , who studied in the weaving workshop under Gunta Stölzl and later set up her own weaving business , designed textiles which were used in the furnishings of the school . The school opened on 4 May 1930 .
It could accommodate 120 trainees . On 2 May 1933 the building was confiscated by the Nazis .
Until the end of World War II the site was used by the Reich Leadership School , for training leaders of the SS ( Schutzstaffel ) , SD ( Sicherheitsdienst ) and Gestapo . At the end of World War II , in spring 1945 , the site was in the Russian controlled sector of Berlin .
The Russian Army used it as a temporary hospital and for military housing . In spring 1946 the building was given to the Free German Trade Union Federation ( FDGB ) , an East German organisation .
During the Nazi period and the Russian occupation the school had been extensively damaged , so long term repair work began .
In 1947 the school opened under the name &amp; quot ; FDGB-Bundesschule &amp; quot ; Theodor Leipart &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( Theodor Leipart FDGB Trade Union School ) .
In January 1952 it was renamed again as the &amp; quot ; Gewerkschaftshochschule &amp; quot ; Fritz Heckert &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( Fritz Heckert Trade Union College ) . Prior to German reunification in October 1990 , the FDGB was disestablished ( May 1990 ) .
The school was closed in September 1990 .
The property of the former FDGB was initially managed by an asset management company which temporarily leased the complex to various organisations .
From August 1991 it was leased long term to the State of Brandenburg for use as a school of public administration , which opened in January 1992 following renovation work . In 1996 the state government took over the complex and it remained vacant for sometime .
In 2001 the Handwerkskammer Berlin ( Berlin Chamber of Skilled Crafts ) sub-leased the main historic building of the complex , the &amp; quot ; Meyer-Wittwer-Bau &amp; quot ; ( Meyer Wittwer Building ) to use as a training centre .
The centre , known in German as the &amp; quot ; Internat des Bildungszentrums der Handwerkskammer Berlin &amp; quot ; , has been in operation since 2007 when the major renovation project was completed . The building was listed as protected monument by the East German government in 1977 . In January 2001 the new lease holders , the Berlin Chamber of Skilled Crafts ( &amp; quot ; Handwerkskammer Berlin &amp; quot ; ) , made a European-wide call for tenders for a redevelopment project , to restore Hannes Meyers original architecture and to enable to building to be useable as a modern teaching facility .
There were 102 responses with the contract awarded to Brenne Gesellschaft von Architekten in July 2001 . The first phase of construction was started in February 2003 .
In early 2005 , the work in the foyer and the dormitories was completed .
The second phase was completed 2007 .
The school building has been almost completely restored to its original state , although the 1950s entrance has been retained . In 2008 the architects , Brenne Gesellschaft von Architekten , won the World Monuments Fund / Knoll Modernism prize for the restoration .
The prize is now given every two years , but this was the first time that it had been awarded . In 2012 the ADGB Trade Union School was nominated to be included on the World Heritage List , as part of the already listed Bauhaus sites in Weimar and Dessau .
A decision is still pending . The &amp; quot ; Stiftung Baudenkmal Bundeschule Bernau &amp; quot ; ( Foundation for the Preservation of the Trade Union School Landmark Bernau ) , was established in September 2011 and granted legal status by the Brandenberg State Ministry of the Interior .
Its main objective is &amp; quot ; to continue researching the building complex . . .
as a cultural and historical landmark , and to raise public awareness &amp; quot ; .

Population Control ( album ) Population Control is the fourth studio album by East Coast hip hop producer Statik Selektah .
The album was released on October 25 , 2011 .
The album features guest appearances from Sean Price , Termanology , Big K . R . I . T . , Freddie Gibbs , Mac Miller , Styles P , Saigon , Jared Evan , Action Bronson , Bun B , Talib Kweli , XV , Colin Munroe , Lil Fame , Pill , Reks , Mitchy Slick , Dom Kennedy , Strong Arm Steady , Skyzoo , Chuuwee , Nitty Scott , MC , Rapsody , Smoke DZA , Joell Ortiz , Brother Ali , Lecrae , DJ Premier , DJ Babu and Scram Jones among others .
The album debuted at number 11 on the US &amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; Top Heatseekers chart in the first week of its release . &amp; quot ; Population Control &amp; quot ; was met with positive reviews from music critics .
Edwin Ortiz of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five , saying &amp; quot ; Statik Selektah may cosign all the rappers present on &amp; quot ; Population Control &amp; quot ; , but it &amp; apos ; s evident that his approval doesn &amp; apos ; t necessarily translate to a pristine collaboration in every instance .
Still , as an artist who has built his reputation on consistency , his latest effort is a fairly solid project that likewise keeps the embers of Hip Hop glowing with passion . &amp; quot ; Jesse Gissen of &amp; quot ; XXL &amp; quot ; gave the album an L , saying &amp; quot ; The biggest problem with the album is Statik &amp; apos ; s need to include everyone in the party .
A lot of the tracks felt too cluttered with MCs that lacked chemistry together ( &amp; quot ; Sam Jack &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Down &amp; quot ; ) and with 20 tracks , the LP dragged towards the middle before picking up steam at the end .
Luckily for listeners , Statik &amp; apos ; s ability to flip a beat never disappoints , as he makes sure to keep heads nodding no matter whose turn it is on the mic .
Hopefully , next time Statik will be a little more selective on whom he decides to include in the general population . &amp; quot ; Nathan S .
of DJBooth gave the album four out of five stars , saying &amp; quot ; The explosion of wack rappers we &amp; apos ; re currently living through can often feel like it &amp; apos ; s threatening to take over , but trying to suppress them is a fool &amp; apos ; s approach .
Like a zombie rap invasion , no matter how many you kill it will never be enough .
Instead the only way to ensure the survival of the dope rap species is to strengthen from within , make the music indestructibly good .
So , without exaggeration , Statik &amp; apos ; s not only put together a nice album , he &amp; apos ; s fired a powerful shot in the war to keep truly quality music alive .
It &amp; apos ; s exactly the kind of &amp; quot ; Population Control &amp; quot ; the game so badly needs . &amp; quot ; Jon O &amp; apos ; Brien of AllMusic gave the album three and a half stars out of five , saying &amp; quot ; Of course , &amp; quot ; Population Control &amp; quot ; could have been released at any point over the last 20 years , but while it &amp; apos ; s not going to change the face of the hip-hop scene , it &amp; apos ; s a classy and authentic old-school affair which effortlessly brings together two of its very different generations . &amp; quot ; The album debuted at number 11 on the US &amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; Top Heatseekers chart in the first week of its release .

KahanismKahanism is an extremist Jewish ideology based on the views of Rabbi Meir Kahane , founder of the Jewish Defense League and the Kach party in Israel .
Kahane maintained the view that the majority of Arabs living in Israel are enemies of Jews and Israel itself , he believed that a Jewish theocratic state , where non-Jews have no voting rights , should be created .
The Kach party has been banned by the Israeli government and the U . S .
State Department has labeled it a Foreign Terrorist Organization . While it is difficult to define &amp; quot ; Kahanism &amp; quot ; in an official manner , the term has come to denote the controversial positions espoused by Rabbi Meir Kahane .
Kahane &amp; apos ; s positions spanned a broad range of subjects . The central claim of Kahanism is the belief that the vast majority of the Arabs of Israel are now , and they will continue to be , enemies of Jews and Israel itself , and that a Jewish theocratic state , governed by Halakha , absent of a voting non-Jewish population that includes Israel , Palestine , areas of modern-day Egypt , Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Iraq , should be created . According to Kahane , the term &amp; quot ; Kahanism &amp; quot ; is primarily used by those who are ignorant of Torah Judaism in order to discredit his ideology , which he asserted is rooted in Halakha and the same as Torah Judaism .
&amp; quot ; Meir Kahane did not hate the Arabs – he just loved the Jews &amp; quot ; , said his widow Libby in her November 20 , 2010 TV interview . Since 1985 , the Israeli government has outlawed political parties espousing Kahane &amp; apos ; s ideology as being &amp; quot ; racist &amp; quot ; , and it forbids their participation in the Israeli government .
The Kach party was banned from running for the Knesset in 1988 , while the existence of the two Kahanist movements formed following Kahane &amp; apos ; s assassination in 1990 were proclaimed illegal terrorist organizations in 1994 and the groups were subsequently officially disbanded .
Activities by followers with militant Kahanist beliefs continue to the present today , however , as seen below .
In 2001 , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights described the official Kahanist website , which was kahane . org at the time , as a hate site espousing prejudiced views in which &amp; apos ; Arabs generally and Palestinians in particular are vilified . &amp; apos ; The deadliest Jewish terrorist attack occurred when Dr .
Baruch Goldstein , supporter of Kach , shot and killed 29 Muslim worshipers , and wounded another 150 , at the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre in Hebron , in 1994 .
This was described as a case of Jewish religious terrorism by Mark Juergensmeyer . Goldstein was a medical doctor who grew up in Brooklyn and he was educated at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx .
He resettled in the Kiryat Arba settlement in the West Bank , and he was politically active for years – he saw Rabbi Meir Kahane as a hero , and he was Kahane &amp; apos ; s campaign manager when he ran for the Israeli parliament through Kahane &amp; apos ; s Kach party .
When Goldstein was threatened with a court-martial for refusing to treat non-Jewish soldiers in the Israeli Defence Force , he declared : &amp; quot ; I am not willing to treat any non-Jew .
I recognize as legitimate only two religious authorities : Maimonides and Kahane . &amp; quot ; Goldstein was denounced &amp; quot ; with shocked horror &amp; quot ; by Orthodox Jews , and most Israelis denounced Goldstein as insane .
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin condemned the attack , describing Goldstein as a &amp; quot ; degenerate murderer &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; a shame on Zionism and an embarrassment to Judaism &amp; quot ; .
At the same time , Goldstein &amp; apos ; s actions were praised by some extremist settlers ; Yochay Ron said that he &amp; quot ; felt good &amp; quot ; when he heard the news , and he also stated that Jews were &amp; quot ; at war with the Arabs &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; all Arabs who live here are a danger to us . . .
they threaten the very existence of the Jewish community on the West Bank . &amp; quot ; Goldstein and other religious settlers at Beit Hadassah ( both Kahanist and Gush Emunim ) believe that the biblical lands on the West Bank are sacred , that Jews are required by God to occupy them , and that the presence of Muslims desecrates the Holy Land .
After this attack , members of the Kach Party praised Goldstein &amp; apos ; s actions , and in the ensuing political turmoil , the Knesset banned Kach in Israel .
The Shamgar Commission in Israel concluded that Baruch Goldstein acted alone . In October 1982 Yoel Lerner , a member of Meir Kahane &amp; apos ; s Kach , attempted to blow up the Dome of the Rock in order to rebuild the Temple Mount site .
He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison .
Mark Juergensmeyer identified him as a Jewish religious terrorist , writing that he &amp; quot ; yearned for a Jewish society in Israel .
He hoped for the restoration of the ancient temple in Jerusalem , the exclusive right of Jews to settle on the West Bank of the Jordan River , and the creation of a state based on biblical law . &amp; quot ; Lerner had previously served a three-year sentence for heading a group that plotted to overthrow the government and establish a state based upon religious law . On August 4 , 2005 , Eden Natan-Zada , an AWOL Israel Defense Forces soldier , killed four Israeli Arab citizens and wounded several others when he opened fire on a bus in the northern Israeli town of Shfaram .
Natan-Zada had recently moved to the settlement of Tapuach , site of a Kahanist yeshiva .
Zada was handcuffed by the Israeli police who arrived to the scene but then lynched by the mob . Roadside shootings , stabbings and grenade attacks against Palestinians have been carried out in Jerusalem and the West Bank by individuals or groups suspected of having ties to the former Kach group .
Aliases such as &amp; quot ; The Committee for the Safety of the Roads &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; The Sword of David &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; The Repression of Traitors &amp; quot ; have been used .
The US government claims that these are all aliases of &amp; quot ; Kach &amp; quot ; , .
In 2002 , a Kahanist group known as &amp; quot ; Revenge of the Toddlers &amp; quot ; claimed responsibility for a bombing attack at Tzur Baher , an East Jerusalem secondary school for Arab boys , that wounded seven .
The group also claimed responsibility for the 2003 bombing of a Palestinian school in Jaba that injured 20 and it was also thought to be linked to the 2002 Zil Elementary school bombing . In the United States , Kahanist groups and organizations are largely inactive , and the bulk of their supporters have emigrated to Israel over the years .
Kahane Net , the Jewish Defense League and B &amp; apos ; nai Elim ( formed by former JDL activists ) are occasionally associated with Kahanism . James David Manning , chief pastor of ATLAH World Missionary Church , has endorsed aspects of Kahane &amp; apos ; s ideology .
Education F . C . Education was a football club from Bhutan , based at Changlimithang , who played in the inaugural Bhutan A-Division , then the top level of football in Bhutan , but since replaced by a full national league . They finished tenth and last in the inaugural season , drawing four and losing five of their nine games .
They finished as the equal lowest scorers for the season with Yangchengphug College with only five goals , but did manage to secure draws against Health School , T .

There are no records available for any competitions held between 1987 – 1995 so it is not known whether they competed again , and there is no record of them competing in any future season for which records exist .
Communist Party of Ireland ( Marxist – Leninist ) The Communist Party of Ireland ( Marxist – Leninist ) was an anti-revisionist political party based in Ireland , it had strong links with Party of Labour of Albania , Communist Party of Canada ( Marxist-Leninist ) and Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain ( Marxist-Leninist ) . CPI ( ML ) originated from the &amp; quot ; Internationalists in Ireland &amp; quot ; , a group started on 9 December 1965 by Hardial Bains , while he was working as a microbiologist at Trinity College , Dublin .
His efforts culminated in the &amp; quot ; Necessity for Change &amp; quot ; conference , at which delegates from Canada , India , Ireland and Britain pledged to build Marxist-Leninist parties in their countries .
They rejected Nikita Khrushchev &amp; apos ; s policies , which they regarded as revisionist , and followed a Marxist-Leninist course .
In 1968 , the Internationalists came to public attention as they organised a protestagainst the visit of King Baudouin of Belgium to Trinity College .
In 1969 , they renamed themselves the Irish Communist Movement ( Marxist-Leninist ) . The ICM opposed the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia . CPI ( ML ) participated in the 1974 UK parliamentary election .
It had candidates in three constituencies in Northern Ireland .
In total they got 540 votes , between 0 . 2 % -0 . 5 % in each constituency .
CPI ( ML ) member David Vipond stood in the 1973 Monaghan by-election , receiving 157 first preference votes .
Vipond later stood for election in Dublin along with other CPI ( ML ) members . CPI ( ML ) ran a bookstore in Dublin called &amp; quot ; Progressive Books and Periodicals &amp; quot ; at 25 Essex St , Dublin 8 .
At various times CPI ( ML ) had bookshops in Limerick and Cork .
In the early 1970s , the group &amp; apos ; s General Secretary was Carole Reakes . CPI ( ML ) originally upheld Mao Zedong Thought - particularly in the 1970-71 period during which entire issues of Red Patriot were dedicated to Mao Zedong but they flatly rejected Mao Zedong after the Sino-Albanian split of 1978 , after which they upheld the writings of Albanian leader Enver Hoxha . The CPI ( ML ) organised several delegations to Albania , beginningin June 1979 , ( when the delegation met Ramiz Alia ) ; CPI ( ML ) delegations there continued during the 80s .
The CPI ( ML ) also supported the communist movements of Vietnam and Cambodia .
They also expressed some support for the Gang of Four faction in China . The CPI ( ML ) were strongly critical of other Irish left-wing parties , including the Workers &amp; apos ; Party of Ireland , Irish Labour Party and the Communist Party of Ireland , whomthe CPI ( ML ) accused of being &amp; quot ; revisionist &amp; quot ; and of not supporting the IRA &amp; apos ; s campaignin the North .
They were especially hostile to Brendan Clifford and his British and Irish Communist Organisation , whose support for the Partition of Ireland and the British Army in Northern Ireland the CPI ( ML ) regarded as a complete betrayal of Maoism . The CPI ( ML ) supported armed struggle for the reunification of Ireland and initiated the Spirit of Freedom Committee to work with Irish republicans .
Other groups created by the party were the Workers and Unemployed Movement and the Communist Youth Union of Ireland ( Marxist-Leninist ) . In the early 1980s , the CPI ( ML ) was a major force in the students &amp; apos ; union movement , with member Brendan Doris becoming president of the Union of Students in Ireland ( USI ) , while members Tommy Graham and Brian Stone became president of the College of Technology ( Bolton Street ) Students &amp; apos ; Union in successive years .
Tommy Graham is the current editor of &amp; quot ; History Ireland &amp; quot ; . With the collapse of socialism in Albania , the CPI ( ML ) opened up relations with the Workers Party of Korea and signed the 1992 Pyongyang Declaration .
General Secretary Rod Eley visited North Korea in 1999 .
In 2003 CPI ( ML ) was disbanded , following a long period of passivity .
Upon dissolution , the general secretary of CPI ( ML ) was Rod Eley .
Following the group &amp; apos ; s dissolution , former leading member Brendan Doris stood in the Dublin West by-election in 2011 for An Chomhdháil Phobail / The People ’ s Convention ( CPPC ) , achieving 95 first preference votes .

Ralph Davis ( basketball ) Ralph E .
Davis Jr .
( born September 7 , 1938 ) is an American former professional basketball player who played two seasons in the NBA and was a starter on two NCAA Final Four teams at the University of Cincinnati . Davis was born in Vanceburg , Kentucky , the son of Ralph E .
Davis Sr . , a self-employed businessman , and Anna Louis ( Plummer ) Davis .
He played basketball at Lewis County High School in Vanceburg .
He scored 1,810 points for the Lions and averaged 26 . 4 points and 18 rebounds per game as a senior .
He was an all-district selection for three years .
As a senior in 1956 he was named second team all-state by Louisville &amp; quot ; Courier-Journal &amp; quot ; as he led the Lions to the Eastern Kentucky Conference title .
He was also an honor student . Davis attended the University of Cincinnati , where he was a three-year starter for the Bearcats and coach George Smith . As a sophomore in 1957 – 58 , he averaged 7 . 9points per game as the Bearcats posted a 25-1record and won the Missouri Valley Conference ( MVC ) title led by fellow sophomore and future Hall-of-Famer forward Oscar Robertson and future longtime NBA player Connie Dierking . As a junior in 1958 – 59 , Davis started at point guard alongside Carl Bouldin and averaged 15 . 5 points ( second to Robertson ) , 4 . 4 assists and 2 . 0 rebounds as the Bearcats were again MVC champions and Davis was named All-MVC .
The 26-4 Bearcats advanced to the NCAA Final Four , where they finished in third place . As a senior in 1959 – 60 , Davis posted averages of 13 . 7 points ( again second to Robertson ) , 4 . 4 assists and 2 . 0 rebounds per game while shooting 50 percent from the field as again the Bearcats won the league crown .

Childhood acquired brain injuryChildhood ( or paediatric ) acquired brain injury ( ABI ) is the term given to any injury to the brain that occurs during childhood but after birth and the immediate neonatal period .
It excludes injuries sustained as a result of genetic or congenital disorder .
It also excludes those resulting from birth traumas such as hypoxia or conditions such as foetal alcohol syndrome . It encompasses both traumatic and non-traumatic ( or atraumatic ) injuries . Traumatic injuries could include a blow to the head ; gunshot ; stabbing ; crushing and excessive vibration / oscillation .
This can be caused by shaking or sudden deceleration .
Traumatic injuries might but do not necessarily have to involve an open wound or penetration of the skull or of the meninges - an &amp; apos ; open head ’ injury . Non-traumatic injuries could include those caused by illnesses , such as tumours , encephalitis , meningitis and sinusitis .
They could also be caused by infections such as septicaemia ; events such as anoxia and hypoxia occasioned by strangulation or near drowning , lead toxicity , and substance misuse . The prevalence of ABI amongst school-aged children in the UK is estimated to be in the region of 1 in 30 , based on admissions to A &amp; amp ; E , although some professionals consider it to be much higher , as a child can be admitted to A &amp; amp ; E with another more urgent injury , which is considered to be of overriding concern at the time . It can be tempting to assume that an injury acquired in childhood is likely to have a more positive long term outcome than one acquired during adulthood .
It could be assumed that a child or adolescent could have a better chance of developing compensatory strategies whilst still at the stage where significant development and learning is taking place .
If the injury is in any way significant this is often not the case . The inherent ‘ plasticity ’ of the brain can occasionally mean that areas damaged beyond healing can relocate their function to other undamaged areas ( the so-called ‘ Kennard principle ’ ) and there are documented cases where this has indeed happened .
However , it is frequently the case that the functions associated with the damaged areas never fully develop and these deficits can present as significant disabilities or difficulties in later life . A significant proportion of the prior learning and the development of skills which has already taken place within an adult ’ s brain can often be retained post injury .
However , a brain at the earlier stages of development , if damaged , might never develop the capacity to learn those skills , leading to subsequent difficulties that could manifest themselves physically , socially , emotionally and educationally . The effects can range from the relatively mild to the catastrophic but all will , to some degree , affect the child ’ s ability to function within an educational and / or social setting .
Educational attainment and quality of life indicators for young adult survivors of childhood acquired brain injury are significantly lower than those of an uninjured peer group . Because a child ’ s brain is a ‘ work in progress ’ , deficits caused by an injury sustained at one age might not become apparent until much later , as the damaged areas become relevant to the child ’ s expected developmental milestones .
This is known as the &amp; apos ; sleeper effect &amp; apos ; and where adults observing the child are unaware either of the injury itself or of the potential effects of an ABI , this can often lead to a misattribution of the failure to achieve academically and socially as ‘ laziness ’ , ‘ teenage tantrums ’ and ‘ going off the rails ’ . It is evident that damage to specific areas of the brain can result in whole areas of knowledge , skills and abilities being lost , sometimes irrevocably .
However , it is also often the case that although some cognitive abilities can be left intact , ( including the ability to retrieve , process and manipulate information ) and much prior learning can remain , a child can be prevented from developing academically and socially because of other , more functional , deficits . There are many ways in which a child with an ABI can become socially disadvantaged and alienated from his or her peers following an injury and the following are only indicative of the problems that might follow reintroduction to their peer group . A common sequela of brain injury is a much reduced ability to process information and therefore to respond to it promptly .
This can mean that a child is unable to keep up with the conversational flow of a group of friends and can be slower than the rest of the group to pick up on jokes and ‘ banter ’ , leaving him / her feeling frustrated and left behind .
However caring and well meaning , the friends can also find it difficult to accommodate this new slowness into their usual give and take , resulting in the affected child being alienated and left out . Another effect often seen as a result of damage to the vulnerable frontal lobes of a child ’ s brain is ‘ disinhibition ’ or a reduced ability to inhibit an impulse to say or do something long enough to calculate whether it ’ s the correct or appropriate thing to say or do .
Research shows that adolescence is the time when the frontal lobe areas of the brain - the areas that govern the ability to manage one ’ s behaviours - develop enough to allow a child to begin to ‘ grow up ’ and start to inhibit their initial impulses . Disinhibition can lead to a child saying apparently hurtful or aggressive things to peers , leading to antagonism and embarrassment .
It can also be the case that because of this , a child with an ABI will be less able to inhibit their responses to other provocations , such as adult authority , resulting in apparent ‘ bad ’ behaviour , leading their friends ( or their friends ’ parents ) to view them as unsuitable companions .
Disinhibition can also lead to sexually harmful behaviour , particularly when coupled with a lowered sense of risk and danger and a child with a brain injury can often become vulnerable to exploitation by peers or by strangers . A reduced ability to access and to process language and therefore to ‘ word find ’ appropriately can result in an increased inclination to use a more readily accessible word - such as a swear word or a more aggressive word - and this can obviously alienate and concern friends , who could interpret this as anger or aggression . Everything we are , everything we are able to do and everything we feel is governed by the functioning of our brain .
What we grow to see as fundamentally ‘ me ’ is a product of our brain and the experiences that have shaped it . When a child experiences a brain injury , its effects could alter his or her academic abilities , likes and dislikes , friendship groups , talents and skills , plans for the future , relationships with parents and siblings , physical prowess - everything that made the child the person they knew themselves to be . The dissonance between the self-image pre injury and the new one post injury can be experienced as a real trauma , as the child tries to come to terms with the new ‘ me ’ , the ‘ death ’ of the old one and the limitations possibly imposed by the effects of the injury . The loss of academic or sporting status , the indifference or antagonism of their peer group , the curtailing of their developing independence because of understandable parental worry , could all be experienced by a brain injured child or adolescent as almost a bereavement . It is not unusual for a brain injured child to experience feelings of worthlessness , depression and loss . Family relationships could also suffer as a result of the injury , as parents struggle to come to terms with the same feelings of bereavement of their plans and hopes for their child , for their family unit and for the life they lived together before the injury .
Siblings also could find it hard to come to terms with the loss of the brother or sister they knew and loved and with the amount of time , attention and emotional energy their parents have expended on the injured child . A childhood acquired brain injury can have a huge variety of effects on the child , at different times during the development of their brain function .
Depending on how well informed another person is about the injury and about the nature of brain development , it can often be easy to ascribe aspects of a child ’ s behaviour ( or ‘ presentation ’ ) to the wrong underlying reason .
It is , for example , common for parents and teachers to misread the effects of a cognitive impairment for a physical issue and a physical problem for a ‘ behavioural ’ one . An example of this could be a child who has great difficulty in ‘ initiating ’ a task or in sequencing elements of a simple task .
When the child fails to respond to what appears to be a straightforward instruction , for example ‘ put away your art work then go over there and get changed for PE ’ , and is found still to be sitting at his desk five minutes later , the teacher might reach the conclusion that he is lazy or defiant . Similarly , a child who has a visual impairment as a result of her injury could be mistaken for being clumsy and uncoordinated or just thoughtless , when she knocks over the milk jug or for being scatterbrained and inattentive when she neglects to complete the math problems written on the right hand side of the board . In order to ensure that children showing the effects of a brain injury are able to fulfil their potential , it is important that these effects are taken into account when planning and delivering a child ’ s school curriculum .
It is also important that teachers are aware of the possible presence in their classroom of a child with an ABI and of what its effects are likely to be . Childhood ABI currently does not feature in the content of any UK teacher training programme , neither is it mentioned as a discrete element of any SEN specialist teaching qualification . Many children displaying the effects of an ABI have been educated in a variety of inappropriate ways , including in the lower academic streams of mainstream schools ; in a range of special schools , primarily designed for learners with other learning difficulties and in schools specialising in working with young people with social , emotional and behavioural disorders .
S v MtewtwaS v Mtewtwa is an important case in South African criminal law , dealing with the defence of compulsion .
The accused , in custody , was threatened by a warder with solitary confinement unless he committed a criminal act .
The court considered what State must prove in such circumstances in order to obtain a conviction . The court held that , where an accused &amp; apos ; s defence is one of compulsion , the onus lies on the State to show that a reasonable man would have resisted the compulsion .
There is no onus on the accused to satisfy the court that he acted under compulsion . Specifically , where a person is in custody and is threatened by a warder with solitary confinement , then , held the court , at the very least the State must show that the accused could reasonably have complained to the prison authorities of the warder &amp; apos ; s wrongful conduct and that such complaint would have averted the threatened confinement .
List of London Underground electric multiple unitsElectric multiple units have operated on the London Underground since 1898 , and exclusively since 1961 .
They are of two sizes , smaller deep-tube trains and larger sub-surface trains that are of a similar size to those on British main lines . The Waterloo &amp; amp ; City line opened in 1898 with electric multiple units , and the later tube railways followed , using trains that were known as gate stock , as access was via lattice gates at each end of each car .
The earlier railways had electrified the underground sections by 1907 .
Pneumatic sliding doors were introduced on tube trains in 1920 and sub-surface trains in the late 1930s .
Until the early 1960s an electric locomotive was exchanged for a steam locomotive on the Metropolitan line beyond Rickmansworth .
The Victoria line opened in the late 1960s using Automatic Train Operation ( ATO ) , and the last train with a guard ran in 2000 . Before 1933 the sub-surface lines were run by two companies , the District Railway and Metropolitan Railway .
As the Circle line was operated jointly , they collaborated in building a prototype in 1900 . Initially District Railway cars were compatible , except for A Stock , and trains were made up from cars of any age , until the incompatible F Stock arrived in 1920 .
The District classified its rolling stock using letters of the alphabet in 1925 , before the fleet was rebuilt , forming main line and local pools .
The H Stock designation was used in 1925 for rebuilt B Stock cars and by LT in the 1930s for the remaining cars with hand-operated doors . The Metropolitan Railway used both Westinghouse ( BWE ) and Thomson-Houston ( BTH ) control equipment , making the cars incompatible .
Originally cars had a saloon layout , but after 1906 surplus bogie compartment carriages built in 1898 and 1900 were converted .
Compartment stock was introduced on Watford services after 1927 . In 1933 the Metropolitan and District railways were merged with the other underground railways , tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board ( LTPB ) , which continued the District Railway classification system . The Great Northern &amp; amp ; City Railway ( now the Northern City Line ) was a tube built in the early 20th century with an internal diameter of to take main-line trains . The deep-level tubes use smaller trains that run in two circular tunnels with a diameter of about .

Their first joint performances were in comedy clubs in 2006 .
Later they began creating interactive art installations in Toronto public spaces . Life of a Craphead was the Art Gallery of Ontario &amp; apos ; s Artist-in-Residence from January to March 2013 .
In April they organized and curated an artistic lecture and performance event entitled Trampoline Hall at the Garrison hall in Toronto . From Oct .
29 and every Sunday until Nov .
29 , 2017 .
Life of a Craphead performed &amp; quot ; King Edward VII Equestrian Statue Floating Down the Don &amp; quot ; , floating a replica of an equestrian sculpture of King Edward VII down the Don River .
The original 15-foot bronze sculpture was erected in India in 1922 to commemorate the Edward VII ’ s reign as emperor .
Toronto businessman Harry Jackman paid to have the bronze figure moved to Toronto from India , where it had been placed in storage after the India became independent in 1947 .
It was installed in Queens Park in 1969 .

S v PretoriusIn S v Pretorius , an important case in South African criminal law , the accused had exceeded the speed limit when taking his child , whom he believed to be in mortal danger , to hospital for treatment .
The court held that the onus of proof in a defence of necessity , as in self-defence , rests on the State , which must rule out the reasonable possibility of an act of necessity .
It is not for the accused to satisfy the court that he acted from necessity .
The conviction of Pretorius was accordingly set aside .
Gary Collins ( baseball coach ) Garrett Ray Collins , known as Gary &amp; quot ; Bo &amp; quot ; Collins is a retired college head coach who coached the SIU Edwardsville Cougars baseball team from 1979 to 2012 .
His teams had 1028 career wins , making him the 56th winningest baseball coach in NCAA baseball and the seventh-highest winner among coaches in NCAA Division II . A native of East Alton , Illinois and a graduate of Roxana High School , Collins entered Southern Illinois University Edwardsville ( SIUE ) as a student just before the school initiated intercollegiate athletics .
As a junior at SIUE , he became a member of Harry Gallatin &amp; apos ; s first Cougar basketball team in 1967 – 68 and a vital member of Roy E .
Lee &amp; apos ; s inaugural baseball team in 1968 , returning to play for both teams as a senior .
His baseball play earned SIUE Baseball Player of the Year honors in 1969 and resulted in his being the first SIUE student-athlete to be drafted to play professional baseball . Collins was a 12th round pick of the St .
Louis Cardinals in the June , 1969 Major League Baseball draft as a first baseman and outfielder .
After two seasons with six clubs in the Cardinal organization , Collins returned to SIUE , becoming an assistant coach for Roy Lee . Collins spent two seasons as Lee &amp; apos ; s assistant , then moved to Lewis and Clark Community College as assistant to coach Arnold Copeland .
In 1979 , Collins returned to SIUE , replacing the retiring Roy Lee as the Cougars head coach .
Over the following 34 seasons , Collins &amp; apos ; Cougars built a record of 1,028-766-7 .
In Collins &amp; apos ; first thirty years as the Cougar coach , the school continued as the strong Division II program built by Coach Lee , earning fourteen trips to the NCAA Division II Baseball Championship tournament and advancing to the Division II College World Series five times .
In 2009 , the Cougars began the transition to NCAA Division I , joining the Ohio Valley Conference ( OVC ) .
In the team &amp; apos ; s first year of eligibility , the Cougars qualified for the 2012 OVC Tournament .
Having seen the team through its transition to Division I , in July 2012 , Collins stepped down as the Cougar &amp; apos ; s head coach , assuming new duties as SIUE &amp; apos ; s first Director of Development for Intercollegiate Athletics .
He retired from the university in February 2014 . Collins earned his bachelor &amp; apos ; s degree in Physical Education in 1970 and added a master &amp; apos ; s degree in counselor education in 1973 , both from SIUE . Total

Ben wants to go so that he can prove himself ready for detective work , but nobody believes in him , especially after the mess he just caused . At home , Ben begins to plan his wedding to Angela , but he clashes with the wedding planner Cori .
He tries to assert himself , but gets knocked out by the ceiling fan .
Later , as Angela tries to seduce Ben , he complains about not being able to go to Miami .
Angela calls James and tries to get him to take Ben , not just for himself , but so she can have him out of her hair while the wedding is planned .
James refuses , but then changes his mind when he thinks he can prove that Ben doesn &amp; apos ; t have what it takes to be a detective .
He goes to their house and officially invites Ben to Miami .
James and Ben drive down to Miami together . Ben starts his detective work by trying to blend in with the locals as they search for A . J .
but Ben gets punished by homicide detective Maya Cruz for using her computer without permission .
Later , James and Ben find the hacker , who tells them about a safe in a club that contains something important , but first they have to meet with someone there .
The guys go to the club for work , but A . J .
gets Ben to enjoy himself with an impromptu bachelor party .
However , the man they are supposed to meet is also Pope &amp; apos ; s hitman .
A . J .
causes a distraction and escapes while James engages in a brief shoot-out with the hitman .
Afterward , the two are met by Maya at the crime scene .
The safe turned out to be empty .
Before the guys can leave , James realizes a bomb was planted under his car , which goes off and destroys his car . Ben realizes he kept A . J . &amp; apos ; s phone on him , so they find his girlfriend Tasha to get a lead on his whereabouts .
Ben convinces Tasha to spill the beans when he shows her that he &amp; apos ; s been hooking up with other women and given them unique ringtones , while Tasha is left with the generic Apple ringtone .
The guys locate A . J .
once more and bring him in on the investigation .
He reveals to the team that Pope is the real crook , despite him having a public image as an entrepreneur working alongside the new port commissioner Nunez .
The team is at the home of Maya &amp; apos ; s friend / associate Alonso , whom Ben accidentally shoots after getting scared .
Despite getting shot , Alonso backs up A . J . &amp; apos ; s word that Pope is a crook . James , Ben , and Maya go to a party hosted by Pope in his mansion .
Maya distracts Pope by dancing with him while James and Ben gather info , and A . J .
is their eyes and ears .
While snooping around , Ben is attacked by Pope &amp; apos ; s pet alligator , Marcus , in the backyard .
After narrowly escaping from the jaws of Pope &amp; apos ; s pet alligator , Ben reconnects with the team and they get their information , but Pope catches them and knows they &amp; apos ; re cops , though he lets them go .
The team uses their information to locate a group of shipping trucks that may be carrying Pope &amp; apos ; s contraband .
However , when they attempt to stop the trucks at the port , they discover that the trucks are empty .
Hernandez Arturo del Puerto scolds the team , as Pope shows up and acts angry for what the team did .
Nunez then shows up and calls Hernandez over .
Brooks is informed of the screw-up and orders James to be suspended and for Ben to be fired . The team goes to a bar to think about what they did wrong .
Maya then questions as to why Nunez would have shown up so fast at the port .
A . J .
mentions that Nunez &amp; apos ; s name was on a list of guys on Pope &amp; apos ; s payroll .
James realizes that Pope knew he would have gotten caught , so he had a decoy in the trucks , and the real contraband items are being brought in somewhere else at the port .
James , Maya , and A . J .
go after Pope , but Maya handcuffs Ben to a pole after James says he wants Ben to stay so he can take care of Angela .
However , Ben breaks free and goes to Alonso &amp; apos ; s house to get the cuffs off . James , Maya , and A . J .
are at the port in the morning to catch Pope .
They have a shootout with Pope and his goons , when Ben arrives and moves a truck to knock over a container with flammable barrels , causing them to explode .
Pope runs and takes A . J .
hostage , then tries fleeing in a truck .
James goes after him , but Ben knocks a container into Pope &amp; apos ; s path , causing him to crash .
James runs to the truck and doesn &amp; apos ; t find Pope .
Pope tries to shoot James , but Ben jumps in the way and takes the bullet .
James shoots Pope a few times to bring him down , then sees that Ben was wearing a bulletproof vest .
Pope rises and shoots again , but James uses Ben as a human shield , and Maya shoots Pope once more for good measure , killing him and ending the gun battle once and for all . James and Ben are off the hook for taking down Pope and Nunez and being commended for their services .
They drive home in a yellow Lamborghini that Maya got for them to drive back to Atlanta for the wedding , with James asking Maya to be his date .
Ben and Angela are married and are ready to go off on a boat ride , but Ben wants James to make a speech .
Reluctantly , James speaks and says that while Ben has gotten him into a lot of trouble since meeting him , he has also saved his life , has made Angela very happy , and has helped James grow into a better man and cop .
He finally accepts Ben as his new family .
Ben and Angela then go on their boat ride , but Ben gets distracted and is thrown out the boat when he rides over a bump .
He is then dragged through the water by a rope as Angela tries to stop the boat , all while James laughs at this .

Ambrose CaliverAmbrose Caliver ( 1894 – 1962 ) changed the face of black education on a national scale .
Dr .
Caliver devoted much of his professional life to adult literacy , although he also took an active role in such matters as displaced persons , human rights , public affairs , aging , and professional development of adult educators . Born 1894 in Saltsville , Virginia , Caliver graduated from Austin High School in 1911 .
He attended Knoxville College in Tennessee and graduated with a B . A .
in 1915 .
He then married Everly Rosalie Rucker a year later in 1916 .
After college , Caliver began teaching at numerous high schools in Tennessee and also gained experience as a High School principal .
By 1917 he was hired to work for the historically black college in Nashville , Tennessee by the name of Fisk University , where he was in charge of their new vocational education program .
Being the motivated man that he was , Caliver also managed to then earn his M . A .
from the University of Wisconsin in 1921 .
In 1930 , he earned his Ph . D .
in Education from Columbia University ’ s Teacher ’ s College .
He was the FIRST black person in the city to earn a Ph .
D .
and the first to earn such degree in the field of education . While at Fisk , Caliver worked a variety of positions until he finally was invited to be the Dean of the University in 1927 .
Three years later , Caliver was appointed to the new position of Senior Specialist in the Education of Negroes in the U . S .
Office of Education by President Herbert Hoover .
When F . D . R was elected President two years later , he kept his post and became a member of F . D . R . ’ s “ black cabinet ” .
&amp; # 91 ; 6 &amp; # 93 ; During Caliver ’ s time in Cabinet , he was very motivated by the inequity in the education of blacks and whites and set out to raise national awareness , particularly in the rural South .
He traveled furiously to accurately document the lack of funding for public schooling . During his tenure in the U . S .
Office of Education , he published numerous articles , bulletins , and pamphlets on current topics relating to African American education and assembled conferences and committees on these matters .
A few of his most famous articles titled , “ The Education of Negro Teachers ” and “ Secondary Education for Negroes . ” In his quest to achieve higher education for African-Americans , Ambrose Caliver also created a nine part radio series , broadcast on NBC , that highlighted the history and achievements of his fellow African-Americans .
The series , “ Freedom Peoples ” , occurred from 1941 to 1942 and was the first substantial program in mass media that focuses solely on the lives and history of the African-American people .
The series included Inventions , which highlighted contributions by African-American inventors , Steal Away which used slave spirituality to show the capacity of African-Americans to turn hardships and pain into beauty and art , W . C .
Handy , which follows the story of the beginning of the blues movement , and War Work , which shows the contributions of African-Americans to World War I and World War II . Ambrose Caliver performed many duties during his tenure in the U . S .
Office of Education , but perhaps the most influential work that he did was the studies he had compiled on a national scale .
During his time in office he notably headed the National Survey of Teacher Education , the National Secondary Education Survey ( 1932 ) , the National Survey of the Vocational and Educational Guidance of Negroes ( 1939 ) , and the National Survey of the Higher Education of Negroes .
He compiled the National Statistics of the Education of Negroes from 1933-1934 and again from 1935-1936 .
These works changed the face of black education on a national scale , bringing to light the common fact that there was an overwhelming lack of secondary education for African-Americans .
Ambrose also served as an adviser for a number of national and international projects , including the U . S .
Displaced Persons Commission ( 1949 ) .
( A displaced person is the same as a forced migrant , meaning one who is forced to leave his / her own country . ) He also worked as the president of the Adult Education Association whose primary focus was in advancing and promoting adults to seek higher education , and was the organizer of the NACEN ( National Advisory on the Education of Negroes ) in which he dies during his term in 1962 . During the eighth conference of the Prairie view educational Conference in 1937 aimed to “ do for Texas what Caliver had done for the country ” The conference was the most important discussion on black higher education in Texas and cited Caliver ’ s 1932 study of black secondary education , along with Caliver ’ s study of black rural education in 1935 . In 1930 Ambrose was appointed Senior Specialist in the education of Negroes in the U . S Office of Education by President Hoover .
Years later , he is named director of the Project for Literacy Education in ( 1946 ) . Dr .
Caliver Ambrose died in 1962 in Washington , D . C , while serving out his term for the National Advisory on the Education of Negroes . &amp; quot ; Ambrose Caliver &amp; # 124 ; BlackUSA . &amp; quot ; BlackUSA .

Mineral Royalties for Citizens and MilitaryThe Mineral Royalties for Citizens and Military ( MRCM ) is a proposed Indian law draft from the Right To Recall team .
This procedure which will enable a national level officer to deposit rent of Government plots and mineral royalty directly into each citizen ’ s bank account .
This law has to be enacted by Transparent Complaint Procedure , and printer in the Gazette of India , Gazette Notification ( GN ) .
DDMRCAM - Direct Deposit of Mineral Royalty to Citizen &amp; apos ; s Account &amp; amp ; Military is the new name accepted and replacing MRCM .
( On April 2014 ) .
The land rent over Indian Institute of Management , Ahmedabad ( IIMA ) plot , Jawaharlal Neheru University ( JNU ) plot , all University Grant Commission plots , Ahmedabad airport plot , all airports plots and 10000s of such Government Of India plots and royalties from all minerals , coals and crude oil of India must go we the Citizens of India and our Military and no one else .
And royalty , rent must come directly , not via any schemes .
For example , lets say rents from Government Of India plots and mineral royalties in Apr-2013 comes as Rs 45,000 crores .
Then as per the DDMRCAM Gazette Notification proposed by Right To Recall team , Rs 15000 crores will go to the Military and about Rs 300 will go to each citizen in his post office or bank account .
If every citizen withdraws cash once or twice a month , this would need no more than 150,000 clerks all over India .
Existing nationalized banks have over 600,000 clerks .
So the distribution of cash is feasible .
The direct cash distribution DDMRCAM draft would create may translate into an income of over Rs 8000 per person per year and also lowering of land / house prices .
Per person , not just per family .
And thus DDMRCAM draft will reduce poverty , increase income and thus increase demands for goods .
The increase in demand for goods will increase local industries and thus increase employment .
The increase in local industries will improve engineering skills and this will improve weapon manufacturing So less poor Hindus will turn towards Christianity or Naxalism or both .
And one year after this law-draft passes , if 3rd child is born , then both the parents will get 33 % less rent ( those who already have third child won ’ t be effected ) .
So this law-draft will also control population . Like all other procedure drafts of Right To Recall team , DDMRCAM law also has to be enacted in Gazette notification through TCP only . Because if the pro-DDMRCAM activists insist on waiting till they get majority in Parliament and then printing DDMRCAM draft in Gazette , then there is possibility that DDMRCAM activists be waiting for ever .
First they may never get majority in Parliament .
And worse , even if they get majority , there is possibility that their own MPs will sell out and refuse to print DDMRCAM draft in Gazette .
For example , in 1977 , Janata Party MPs had promised to enact Right to Recall laws before election , and after getting elected , later they all refused to pass Right to Recall laws .
So , as pe the Right To Recall group , DDMRCAM activists should focus on creating mass movement on TCP draft , and then use TCP draft to get DDMRCAM draft passed rather than wait for election victory .
A mass movement on DDMRCAM draft is not a bad option — it will give positive feedback to mass-movement for TCP draft .
The drawback of mass movement on DDMRCAM draft is that nonintellectuals will get enough chances to raise doubts against DDMRCAM draft and thus disperse the movement .
That ’ s because DDMRCAM draft is over four pages long and nonintellectuals can raise questions on each clause .
Whereas since TCP draft is only 2 to 3 clauses , it is difficult for nonintellectuals to disperse the movement for TCP draft by raising frivolous questions . This task can be done using Universal Banking System ( described later ) in which every citizen will have exactly one citizen-account in State Bank of India ( or a Govt Bank or Post Office ) at the branch of his choice .
The amount dispatched by NLRO will be added to the citizen ’ s account and withdrawal can be done at most once a week in denominations of Rs 100 / - for free .
The account owner will need to bring his passbook with photo and the cheque with signature and thumb print to be put in front of cashier and camera inside the bank .
Later , ATM can also be used .
With this very restricted procedure a cashier can give out 30 payments per hour or about 200 persons in his 8-hour shift or about 5000 payments in a month .
So to deliver one payment a month to 120 crores citizens , the SBI would need 120cr / 5000 = about 240,000 cashiers .
Further , till a child is of 14 years , the payment will go into mothers ’ account and so the number of clerks required will reduce by about 30 % to 180,000 clerks .
According to the right to recall team , using about 180,000 cashiers India wide , some 10000 supervisors and 10000 other staff , it is possible to dispatch 120cr payments every month .
And as ATM become more widespread , the number of clerks needed will further reduce and number of cash-outs per month can be increased to 3 per month . To decrease impostering , the persons in a locality may form a group of at least 10 person and maximum of 20 persons to be referred as “ group of reciprocal witnesses ” .
If the person is member of group of 10 , then restriction is that at least 5 persons in that group must accompany him when he goes for withdrawal .
In general , all ten will go for withdrawal on the same day and same time .
If the person is part of such group , everyone in group will get the amount at together and thumb prints of five mutual witnesses will be taken on the payment receipt . One argument that the right to recall team get against DDMRCAM is that managing a network of 200,000 clerks will be impossible and so instead the money should be spent in education , health etc .
Well , to teach 25 cr kids between age of 5 and 17 , we would one teacher per 100 students at least i . e .
25 lakhs teachers .
The floor space needed in schools needed will be at least about 1 sq m per student i . e .
25 crores sq m of floor space .
To serve 100 crores citizens in Hospitals , we would need at least one doctor per 2000 citizens i . e . 500,000 doctors and about 10,00,000 nurses .
In addition , we would require 1000s of buildings for hospitals .
As per the right to recall team , providing education to 25 crores students and health to 100 crores citizens requires 20-100 times more staff than staff to dispatch 100 crores rent payments .
So while I do support education , health etc .
I see no need to cancel the “ rent dispatch ” scheme on the grounds of “ number of clerks ” needed .
The number of clerks needed to 100 crores payments every month dispatch payments is no more than 2,00,000 and is far less than alternative schemes . The 33 % of mineral royalties do go to Government ( Military ) , which can be seen as 33 % income tax on every common and his income from mineral royalties and land rent .
Now this 33 % will INCREASE after 67 % goes to citizens .
How ? Consider mineral royalties today .
Today , for a granite block that is worth Rs 100 in market , whose extraction and transportation cost is below Rs 10 , Govt gets royalties of Rs 5 or even less .
Why are the bids so low ? Because the local mining contractors hire criminals to ensure that more miners cannot come and bid in the Collectors ’ offices to submit the bids .
But the criminals are able to operate ONLY because they have support of MLAs , MPs , Ministers , CMs , PM , IPS , IAS and relative lawyers of the judges .
IOW today , using criminals , MLAs , MPs , Ministers , CMs , PM , IPS , IAS and relative lawyers of the judges ensure that lion &amp; apos ; s share of deemed royalties come into their hands via the mine contractors and criminals they bless .
Now today , I activists were to tell commons that commons should fight against these Ministers , IPS , IAS and judges ’ relative lawyers , then two key questions arise – 1 .
how can a common fight ? and2 .
why should a common risk his lives or spend time to do so ? The name DDMRCAM-Recall answers both these key questions .
DDMRCAM answers the second question : if mineral royalties are going to citizens then the citizens have reason to ensure that criminals who stop good mining contractors getting killed or imprisoned .
And the Recall answers the first question : using Right to Recall over Policemen , judges , CM etc .
the citizens can ensure that police chiefs , judges , Ministers who promote criminals are replaced ASAP by individuals who are pro-common .
So “ DDMRCAM-Recall ” will increase the mineral royalties to several fold , and that will also increase the royalties that Military gets .
Thus , the sum total of govt income from minerals will increase from DDMRCAM , NOT decrease . In the same way , consider the issue of Govt plots .
Today , PM , CMs give away a large number of GoI plots for a price fraction of market price .
The Right to Recall CMs , RTR-PM provides means by which citizens can stop this .
And DDMRCAM i . e .
giving land rent to commons and Military gives a reason to citizens to stop this .
Every time , a CM , PM rents out the land for rent below market value , the citizens will feel a loss , and when the loss exceeds some tolerance amount , they will spend Rs 3 file for an approval and replace him .
Or better , fear of replacement and subsequent punishments will put a check on CMs , PM while doling away lands for bribes .
So the net rents will increase and so the 1 / 3rd of the rent that goes to the Govt ( Military ) will also increase . So DDMRCAM-Recall proposals increase the net Govt incomes from minerals and land rent – they do not decrease it .
It also increases the incomes of the commons .
Then who loses ? The criminals and mine contractors will be small losers — the real losers will be IPS , IAS , Ministers , CMs , PM , super elitemen who own huge mine , relative lawyers of judges etc .
And those who oppose DDMRCAM-Recall proposals , are only benefiting the criminals , mineral ore contractors , IAS , IPS , relatives of judges , super elitemen who own huge mines etc .
and no own else .
Many intellectuals are on their payrolls and so vigorously oppose DDMRCAM-Recall proposals to serve their interests .

International sanctionsInternational sanctions are political and economic decisions that are part of diplomatic efforts by countries , multilateral or regional organizations against states or organizations either to protect national security interests , or to protect international law , and defend against threats to international peace and security .
These decisions principally include the temporary imposition on a target of economic , trade , diplomatic , cultural or other restrictions ( sanctions measures ) that are lifted when the motivating security concerns no longer apply , or when no new threats have arisen .
According to the Charter of the United Nations , only the UN Security Council has a mandate by the international community to apply sanctions ( Article 41 ) that must be complied with by all UN member states ( Article 2,2 ) .
They serve as the international community &amp; apos ; s most powerful peaceful means to prevent threats to international peace and security or to settle them .
Sanctions do not include the use of military force .
However , if sanctions do not lead to the diplomatic settlement of a conflict , the use of force can be authorized by the Security Council separately under Article 42 . UN sanctions should not be confused with unilateral sanctions that are imposed by individual countries in furtherance of their strategic interests .
Typically intended as strong economic coercion , measures applied under unilateral sanctions can range between coercive diplomatic efforts , economic warfare , or as preludes to war .
There are several types of sanctions . Economic sanctions are distinguished from trade sanctions , which are applied for purely economic reasons , and typically take the form of tariffs or similar measures , rather than bans on trade . Sanctions formulations are designed into three categories .
The categories are used to differentiate between the political contexts due to the global nature of the act . First category involves such sanctions that are designed to force cooperation with international law .
This can be seen in the sanctions placed on Iraq in Resolution No .
661 on August 6 , 1990 , after the initial invasion of neighboring Kuwait .
The United Nations placed an embargo on the nation in an attempt to prevent armed conflict .
Resolution 665 and Resolution 670 were further added creating both naval and air blockade on Iraq .
The purpose of the initial sanctions was to coerce Iraq into following international law , which included the recognized sovereignty of Kuwait . The second category of design is those sanctions with the purpose to contain a threat to peace within a geographical boundary .
The 2010 Iran nuclear proliferation debate is a contemporary example .
The current United Nations Security Council passed on June 9 , Resolution 1929 providing restrictions on missile and weaponry materials that could be used for the creation of destructive weapons .
This principle of restriction is to contain the possibility of Iranian aggression within the neighboring region . The third category involves the United Nations Security Councils condemnation of actions of a specific action or policy of a member / non-member nation .
The white minority declared a declaration of Rhodesian Independence on November 11 , 1965 .
The General assemble and United Nations in a 107 to 2 vote took to condemning Rhodesia on all military , economic , as well as oil and petroleum products .
The international display of disapproval forced sanctions onto the Rhodesian people , but without a clear goal as to a remedy for the economic sanctions . The three categories are a blanket explanation on the reasons sanctions are applied to nations , but it does not go as far as to say that voting members share the same political reasons for imposing them .
It is often the case for many nations to be driven by self-interests in one or more categories when voting on whether or not to implement sanctions . Diplomatic sanctions are political measures taken to express disapproval or displeasure at a certain action through diplomatic and political means , rather than affecting economic or military relations .
Measures include limitations or cancellations of high-level government visits or expelling or withdrawing diplomatic missions or staff . Economic sanctions can vary from imposing import duties on goods to , or blocking the export of certain goods from the target country , to a full naval blockade of the target &amp; apos ; s ports in an effort to verify , and curb or block specified imported goods . Well known examples of economic sanctions include : Since 1993 many countries have imposed trade sanctions on Burma ( Myanmar ) . The case of South Africa gives rise to the typical example used for arguing for the effectiveness of sanctions , though that alleged effectiveness remains a matter of debate . On May 13 , 1998 , the United States and Japan imposed economic sanctions on India following that country &amp; apos ; s second round of nuclear tests .
Japan lifted its sanctions against India three years later .
The US lifted its sanctions against India in 2001 . In 2001 / 2002 the United States imposed economic sanctions against the state of Zimbabwe , through the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 or ZDERA , , vetoing or voting against access to financing , debt relief and rescheduling , and forcing the Zimbabwean government to operate on a cash-only basis . Similarly military sanctions can range from carefully targeted military strikes to degrade a nation &amp; apos ; s conventional or non-conventional capabilities , to the less aggressive form of an arms embargo to cut off supplies of arms or dual-use items . Sport sanctions are used as a way of psychological warfare , intended to crush the morale of the general population of the target country .
The only instance where sports sanctions were used were the international sanctions against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , 1992 – 1995 , enacted by UN Security Council by resolution 757 .
The Gleneagles Agreement approved by the Commonwealth of Nations in 1977 , committed member nations to discourage contact and competition between their sportsmen and sporting organisations , teams or individuals from South Africa .
However , it was not binding and unable to stop events such as the 1980 British Lions tour to South Africa or the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand . The United Nations Security Council can implement sanctions on political leaders or economic individuals .
These persons usually find ways of evading their sanction because of political connections within their nation . The sanctions on environment include both economic and political issues such as trade since these are all interdependent .
The trade barriers and restrictions on trade are the key factors since they are engaged with the problems of endangered species , ozone-depleting chemicals and environmental laws .
Although the sanctions and laws regarding the environment are relatively new , recent concerns over the environmental issues encouraged individuals and governments to actively cooperate in dealing the problems . Entities favorable to the target of another government &amp; apos ; s sanctions may claim that sanctions imposed by single countries or by an intergovernmental body like the United Nations are &amp; quot ; illegal &amp; quot ; or &amp; quot ; criminal &amp; quot ; due to , in the case of economic sanctions , the right to development or , in the case of military sanctions , the Right of self-defense . A 1996 report by International Progress Organization criticized sanctions as &amp; quot ; an illegitimate form of collective punishment of the weakest and poorest members of society , the infants , the children , the chronically ill , and the elderly . &amp; quot ; Sanctions have long been the subject of controversy as scholars question their effects on citizens , the level of ethnocentrism involved when designing and implementing sanctions , and the possibility of ineffectiveness .
Supporters of sanctions argue that regardless of sanctions &amp; apos ; effects on a group of people , those citizens were most likely already being oppressed by their government .
Supporters also argue that sanctions are the best alternative international tool , as opposed to taking no action , and that in the absence of sanctions , oppressive regimes have no incentive to reform . On the side of opposition , it is asserted that sanctions are a way to promote American values and diminish the culture of a state .
In a counterargument , support is argued on the basis that something must be done and democratic peace theory is cited , as sound reasoning for any possible traces of cultural insensitivity .
It is also noted that the US has little to lose , in regards to public perception , as many around the world already have a distaste for American policies and actions . In regards to the effectiveness of the outcomes of sanction implementation , supporters concede that multilateral sanctions have been found to work 33 % of the time .
However , it is argued that while sanctions are not a hundred percent effective , it is not the case that they are never effective . Dissolution of sanctions . . . There are several ways to remove and dissolve sanctions that have been implemented on a nation ( s ) .
In some cases such as those implemented on Iraq in 1990 , only a reverse resolution can be used to remove the sanctions .
This is done when no provision is put in the resolution for the removal of sanctions .
This is generally only done if the sanctioned party has shown willingness to adopt certain conditions of the Security Council .
Another way sanctions can be removed is when time limits are implemented with the initial sanction .
After an extended duration the sanction will eventually be lifted off the nation despite cooperation .
Additional sanctions may be placed however if the Security Council deems it necessary .
The practice of time limitations has grown over the years and allows for gradual removal of restrictions on nations conforming to at least partial conditions imposed by the Security Council .

Socialist Party ( England and Wales ) The Socialist Party is a Trotskyist political party in England and Wales which adopted its current name in 1997 after being formerly known as Militant , an entryist group in the Labour Party from 1964 until it abandoned that tactic in 1991 .
The party stands under the electoral banner of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition ( TUSC ) . The Socialist Party has sister parties in Scotland and Ireland and is a member of the Committee for a Workers &amp; apos ; International and the European Anti-Capitalist Left . The Socialist Party was formerly the Militant group ( also known as the Militant tendency ) which practised entryist tactics in the Labour Party and organised around the &amp; quot ; Militant &amp; quot ; newspaper .
Founded in 1964 , the &amp; quot ; Militant &amp; quot ; newspaper described itself as the &amp; quot ; Marxist voice of Labour and Youth &amp; quot ; .
In the 1980s , prominent Militant supporters Dave Nellist , Pat Wall and Terry Fields were elected to the House of Commons as Labour MPs .
In 1982 , the Liverpool District Labour Party adopted Militant &amp; apos ; s policies for Liverpool City Council in its battle against cuts in the rate support grant from government , and adopted the slogan &amp; quot ; Better to break the law than break the poor &amp; quot ; .
It came into conflict with the Conservative government . In 1989 – 1990 , Militant led the All-Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation , which organized a successful non-payment campaign against the Community Charge , commonly called the poll tax .
Militant &amp; apos ; s battles in Liverpool and against the poll tax involved defiance of what it regarded as iniquitous laws .
Militant supporting Labour MP Terry Fields was jailed for refusing to pay the poll tax and expelled from the Labour Party for defying the law .
The Labour Party had earlier found Militant guilty of operating as an entryist group with a programme and organisation entirely separate from that of the Labour Party running contrary to the party &amp; apos ; s constitution .
Militant rejected these findings , claiming it stood for Labour &amp; apos ; s core socialist policies , whilst the &amp; apos ; right-wing &amp; apos ; leadership were the real infiltrators , intent on changing the Labour Party into a capitalist party . In 1991 , there was a debate within Militant as to whether to continue working within the Labour Party .
The debate centred around whether Militant could still effectively operate in the Labour Party following the expulsions , whereas previously , under a more left-wing National Executive Committee ( NEC ) , the Labour Party had not been inclined to support expulsions .
Furthermore , the ferment and anger the poll tax had generated suggested that there was more to be gained as an open organisation than inside a Labour Party which opposed the Anti-Poll Tax Unions &amp; apos ; tactic of non-payment of the tax .
At a special conference 93 % of delegates voted for the &amp; apos ; Open Turn &amp; apos ; .
A minority around Ted Grant broke away to form Socialist Appeal and remain in the Labour Party . This debate ran alongside a parallel debate on the future of Scottish politics .
The result was that the experiment of operating as an &amp; quot ; open party &amp; quot ; was first undertaken in Scotland under the name of Scottish Militant Labour , standing Tommy Sheridan for election from his jail cell .
The Militant tendency became Militant Labour in 1991 , after leaving the Labour Party .
The journal &amp; quot ; Militant International Review &amp; quot ; , founded in 1969 , became a monthly publication and was renamed &amp; quot ; Socialism Today &amp; quot ; in 1995 .
In 1997 , Militant Labour changed its name to the Socialist Party , and the Militant newspaper was renamed &amp; quot ; The Socialist &amp; quot ; in the same year . Obtaining higher wages for workers is a central policy objective of the Socialist Party .
In 2014 , 17 front-page headlines of &amp; quot ; The Socialist &amp; quot ; focused on wages . On 16 July 2014 , &amp; quot ; The Socialist &amp; quot ; front-page headline stated &amp; quot ; Raise the minimum wage : £ 10 NOW &amp; quot ; .
The front page quoted the General Secretary of the Bakers , Food and Allied Workers Union , Ronnie Draper , calling for &amp; apos ; a minimum wage of £ 10 now &amp; apos ; .
The call for a £ 10 an hour minimum wage , the front page explains through a second quote , was inspired by the &amp; apos ; historic victory of the $ 15 minimum wage in Seattle . &amp; apos ; On 24 September 2014 the front page , carrying the slogan &amp; apos ; We need £ 10 an hour now ! &amp; apos ; states that &amp; apos ; As a result of a Bakers &amp; apos ; Union motion , the Trades Union Congress ( TUC ) adopted the £ 10 demand at its recent conference . &amp; apos ; In 2011 , the Socialist Party gave prominent support to the Jarrow March for Jobs , a 330-mile march from Jarrow in South Tyneside to London to highlight youth unemployment , supported by several MPs , eight trade unions and the &amp; quot ; Daily Mirror &amp; quot ; newspaper .
Kevin Maguire , associate editor of the Mirror , spoke at the Jarrow launch rally , following the Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s Coventry councillor Dave Nellist , as featured on a number of Socialist Party videos about the event .
The Jarrow march featured prominently at the Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s Socialism 2011 weekend event in November 2011 , which coincided with the marchers &amp; apos ; arrival in London . The Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s first issue of 2010 , headlined &amp; quot ; Rage Against Unemployment &amp; quot ; and written by Youth Fight for Jobs national organiser Sean Figg , who took part in the Jarrow March for Jobs , argues that young people are likely to suffer &amp; apos ; permanent psychological scars &amp; apos ; from unemployment .
Figg calls for the right to a &amp; quot ; decent job for all &amp; quot ; , with a &amp; quot ; living wage &amp; quot ; of at least £ 8 an hour , and an end to university fees .
Figg demands that the government &amp; quot ; bail out young people &amp; quot ; as it had the banks , stating that &amp; quot ; capitalist politicians &amp; quot ; will claim the cost would be &amp; apos ; too high &amp; apos ; . The National Union of Students ’ NEC voted &amp; quot ; to stand in complete solidarity with workers taking strike action &amp; quot ; in the 3 December strike in higher and further education as a result of an Emergency Motion passed by NUS NEC , which was moved by Socialist Party and Socialist Students NUS NEC member , Edmund Schluessel . Former Socialist Party councillor Dave Nellist calls climate change &amp; quot ; the outcome of a gigantic market failure &amp; quot ; citing a United Nations report .
He places the blame for climate change on &amp; quot ; big business &amp; quot ; .
In an issue of &amp; quot ; The Socialist &amp; quot ; headlined &amp; quot ; Climate change : &amp; apos ; gigantic market failure &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; , the Socialist Party calls for &amp; quot ; green job creation &amp; quot ; , proposing that unemployed construction workers be employed to build &amp; quot ; new and affordable housing , insulating existing properties and installing solar panels &amp; quot ; .
It also suggests retooling the car industry for the production of lower emission vehicles and demands a &amp; quot ; massive investment into renewable and sustainable energy sources &amp; quot ; with the &amp; quot ; profit motive eliminated &amp; quot ; . The Socialist Party opposes the British government &amp; apos ; s military interventions around the world , such as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and called for the withdrawal of troops .
It opposes both terrorism and also the war on terror .
It joined the protests against the Group of Eight ( G8 ) meetings as part of the Committee for a Workers &amp; apos ; International . In the aftermath of the 9 / 11 attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York in September 2001 , Peter Taaffe , the Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s general secretary , writing in the Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s newspaper &amp; quot ; The Socialist &amp; quot ; , states : In December 2009 , the Socialist Party demanded what it called &amp; quot ; socialist nationalisation &amp; quot ; as the only way to save the manufacturing industry .
This marks a response by the Socialist Party to the nationalisation of major banks by the Labour Government , beginning with the nationalisation of Northern Rock in February 2008 . In the &amp; apos ; What we stand for &amp; apos ; column of &amp; quot ; The Socialist &amp; quot ; , its weekly paper , the Socialist Party calls for &amp; quot ; a socialist government to take into public ownership the top 150 companies and banks that dominate the British economy , and run them under democratic working-class control and management .
Compensation to be paid only on the basis of proven need . &amp; quot ; The Socialist Party thus defines its &amp; quot ; socialist &amp; quot ; nationalisation to include at least three distinct features : no compensation except on the basis of proven need ; democratic workers &amp; apos ; control and management , and that the nationalised industries should be part of a &amp; quot ; plan of production &amp; quot ; . In an end of year statement on the December 2009 Pre-budget , an article under the name of the Socialist Party deputy general secretary , Hannah Sell , indicated the Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s response to the banking nationalisations .
Sell argued that the trade unions should demand &amp; quot ; nationalisation of all the major financial institutions &amp; quot ; , with compensation paid only to small shareholders and depositors on the basis of proven need .
However Sell added that this should be just a first step to the &amp; quot ; unification of all the banks into one democratically controlled financial system &amp; quot ; and called for the introduction of a state monopoly of foreign trade . On workers &amp; apos ; control and management , Sell argues that a nationalised finance sector could be &amp; quot ; run by and for the mass of the population &amp; quot ; .
She suggests that this could be done through &amp; quot ; majority representation &amp; quot ; at all levels .
Representatives are to be drawn from workers in the banking unions , &amp; quot ; and the wider working class and labour movement &amp; quot ; , and some also the government . The Socialist Party believes that socialism can only be realised on an international basis : In accordance with a perceived need for internationalism , the Socialist Party is a member of the Committee for a Workers &amp; apos ; International , an organisation of Trotskyist political parties from across the globe . The Socialist Party argues that the Soviet Union was not socialist : &amp; quot ; the regimes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were not genuinely socialist , but a grotesque caricature . &amp; quot ; Its analysis follows that of Leon Trotsky , who , with Vladimir Lenin and others , led the October 1917 Russian revolution . The Socialist Party argues that neither Lenin nor Trotsky wished to establish an isolated socialist state .
They argue that Lenin , Trotsky and the Bolsheviks defended and advanced the gains of the revolution of February 1917 by carrying through the October revolution .
They emphasise Lenin and Trotsky &amp; apos ; s call on workers in the advanced capitalist countries to carry through the socialist transformation of society .
This , they say , would have been a step towards the goal of a world socialist federation and would have seen those countries come to the aid of the economically and industrially underdeveloped Russia .
However , this was not successful and the advanced capitalist countries invaded , blockaded and imposed trade sanctions on the young workers &amp; apos ; state .
The Socialist Party agrees with Trotsky that the isolated Russian revolution inevitably &amp; quot ; degenerated &amp; quot ; under Stalin into a bureaucratic dictatorship .
In this and many other ways , the Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s policies may therefore be termed orthodox Trotskyism . The Socialist Party argues that the Labour Party under the leadership of Tony Blair and since &amp; quot ; has deprived the working people in Britain of any kind of political representation &amp; quot ; and campaigns for a new mass party of the working class based on the trade unions and the working class movement .
It argues that political representatives such as Members of Parliament should only receive the &amp; quot ; average workers wage &amp; quot ; , and its parliamentary candidates would only take the average wage of a skilled worker , if elected , in the same way that Labour MPs who supported Militant ( the forerunner of the Socialist Party ) -Terry Fields , Dave Nellist and Pat Wall – did in the 1980s .
In elections , when not standing as part of an alliance , the Socialist Party fields candidates as &amp; quot ; Socialist Alternative &amp; quot ; .
The right to stand under the name &amp; quot ; Socialist Party &amp; quot ; was won by the Socialist Party of Great Britain , which was founded in 1904 . In the 1990s , the Socialist Party was one of the founders of the local Socialist Alliance groups , which joined together as a national network in 1999 .
In 2001 , the organisation was transformed from a federal body into a one-member-one-vote political party .
The Socialist Party opposed this change in structure , arguing that it allowed the single largest group in the alliance , the SWP , to control it .
It could also mean that local Social Alliances affiliated to the national body had , in effect , to expel any members who declined to join the Socialist Alliance party .
As a result , the Socialist Party left the alliance late that year .
The Socialist Alliance itself was dissolved in 2005 , following its merger with RESPECT . In February 2005 , the Socialist Party announced plans to contest the 2005 parliamentary elections as part of a new electoral alliance called the Socialist Green Unity Coalition ( SGUC ) .
Several former components of the Socialist Alliance that did not join RESPECT also joined the SGUC .
Following the local elections in 2007 , the Socialist Party had two councillors in St .
Michael &amp; apos ; s in Coventry , and two in Telegraph Hill ward in Lewisham , South London .
A member of the party was also elected in Huddersfield but stood under the Save Huddersfield NHS party banner .
In the local elections of 2010 , however , the party lost one of the two councillors in Coventry and both councillors in Lewisham . In November 2005 at its annual &amp; quot ; Socialism &amp; quot ; event , the Socialist Party formally launched the Campaign for a New Workers &amp; apos ; Party along with other socialists , left activists and trade unionists with the aim of persuading individuals , campaigners and trade unions to help set up and back a new broad left alternative to New Labour that would fight for working class people .
The National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers ( RMT union ) held a conference in January 2006 to address what it calls &amp; apos ; the crisis in working class representation &amp; apos ; , in which Socialist Party councillor and Campaign for a New Workers &amp; apos ; Party chair Dave Nellist was invited to speak .
Most of the speakers were in favour of a broad left alternative to New Labour .
The remaining speakers , such as MP John McDonnell , wished it well .
The Campaign for a New Workers &amp; apos ; Party held a conference on 19 March 2006 , which was attended by around 1,000 people , to formally launch the Campaign for a New Workers &amp; apos ; Party . At the 2008 CNWP conference a discussion forum was hosted by the campaign which was addressed by RMT general secretary Bob Crow , PCS Vice-President John McInally , Socialist Party councillor Dave Nellist , Labour left Simeon Andrew and RESPECT representative Rob Hoveman . In March 2009 , the Socialist Party was invited to participate in No to EU – Yes to Democracy , a left-wing alter-globalisation coalition by the RMT union leader Bob Crow , for the 2009 European Parliament elections .
No2EU received 153,236 votes or 1 % of the national vote .
This alliance then developed into the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition . Supporters of the No2EU electoral challenge entered discussions on a continued electoral alliance and in January 2010 the formation of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition ( TUSC ) was announced in time to contest the 2010 general election .
The Scotsman newspaper named Bob Crow as the coalition &amp; apos ; s leader .
According to the Scotsman , policies include : &amp; quot ; commitment to public ownership of industry , banking and utilities ; a promise not to implement cuts in public services ; an end to public bail-outs of the banking industry ; improved trade union rights ; and an end to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . &amp; quot ; The 38 TUSC candidates who ran in the elections pooled 12,275 votes .
The four Socialist Party candidates who still stood under the name Socialist Alternative received an additional 3,298 votes .
The party lost its only remaining Councillor , Dave Nellist , in the 2012 elections to Coventry City Council , although he received a greater number of votes than for his previous election . In March 2013 Joe Robinson , a Socialist Party member standing as TUSC , won a Maltby Town Council by-election .
A second TUSC supporter &amp; amp ; Socialist Party member , Shaun Barratt was elected unopposed as a town councillor on 27 March 2014 . On 30 April 2014 , the Socialist Party reported that the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition ( TUSC ) &amp; quot ; will be fielding 561 candidates in the local elections on 22 May . &amp; quot ; It terms the TUSC election challenge of the May 2014 council elections &amp; quot ; the biggest left of Labour electoral challenge since World War Two . &amp; quot ; No candidates were elected . At its annual congress in February 2015 , the Socialist Party discussed TUSC &amp; apos ; s target of standing 100 parliamentary candidates and 1000 council candidates .
Achieving this target should secure a TV broadcast . By the end of February 2015 , 95 TUSC parliamentary candidates had been approved by the TUSC steering committee , with more expected , six of which were standing in the Independent newspaper &amp; apos ; s top 100 marginal constituencies against sitting Labour MPs .
On 25 February 2015 , the United Left , a broad left caucus within Unite the Union , wrote an open letter to Socialist Party members in Unite appealing for them to withdraw from standing against the Labour Party in marginal constituencies in the 2015 general election .
Signed by the Chair and vice chair of the Unite Executive Councils and a number of regional chairs , the letter accused the Socialist Party of having a &amp; quot ; derisory &amp; quot ; electoral record , gaining coverage in the &amp; quot ; Morning Star &amp; quot ; newspaper .
In response , the Socialist Party claimed that a Labour government &amp; quot ; would be at best austerity-lite and a continuation of the crisis that faces working-class people .
This prospect has led to a fracturing of politics . &amp; quot ; The Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s reply pointed out that &amp; quot ; we are part of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition ( TUSC ) that also comprises the RMT in an official capacity , representing its 80,000 members , and other leading trade unionists from PCS , Unite , NUT and the POA as well as other socialist organisations and individuals . &amp; quot ; Asking &amp; quot ; why is this letter necessary ? &amp; quot ; if its efforts were derisory , the Socialist Party nevertheless appealed to the United Left to &amp; quot ; enter a dialogue &amp; quot ; with TUSC &amp; apos ; s steering committee about any threatened Labour Party MPs they feel are likely to represent Unite &amp; apos ; s members interests in parliament . The final count for TUSC candidates is 135 parliamentary , and 619 council . The Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s demand for nationalisation and its longstanding practice of running in elections , has led some critics to label the Socialist Party as reformist , though the party argues that its method is based on Trotsky &amp; apos ; s Transitional Programme , and that this demand would lead to the socialist transformation of society , with a &amp; quot ; socialist plan of production . . .
to meet the needs of all &amp; quot ; whilst &amp; quot ; protecting our environment . &amp; quot ; Critics from within the Trotskyist tradition have sometimes argued that the Socialist Party misunderstands Trotsky &amp; apos ; s Transitional Programme .
Since &amp; apos ; transitional demands &amp; apos ; are an attempt to link today &amp; apos ; s struggles with the struggle for socialism , critics argue that Trotsky &amp; apos ; s transitional demand regarding the need for strike committees should be raised , and that the Socialist Party should argue for these strike committees to take control of the workplaces .
They argue that this is preferable to arguing for nationalisation since nationalisation does not show how workers would reach workers &amp; apos ; control of the workplaces . The Socialist Party argues that the sections of Trotsky &amp; apos ; s Transitional Programme which argue for the &amp; apos ; expropriation of separate groups of capitalists &amp; apos ; and of the &amp; apos ; private banks &amp; apos ; can be represented as nationalisation , as long the demand includes workers &amp; apos ; control and management of the nationalised industries .
For this reason , the Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s call for public ownership in the &amp; apos ; What We Stand For &amp; apos ; column in &amp; apos ; The Socialist &amp; apos ; newspaper , is followed by the demand for democratic working class control and management , as well as &amp; quot ; Compensation to be paid on the basis of proven need &amp; quot ; , as judged by the workers once in control and management of the industry in question . The Socialist Party criticises what it terms the &amp; quot ; lavish &amp; quot ; compensation given to the bosses of nationalised industries in the past , and links up the demand for nationalisation to demands for the workers to rely on their own control and management of the nationalised industries , and to the need for the socialist transformation of society itself .
It argues that this is a valid modern interpretation of the Transitional Programme &amp; apos ; s conception . At the outset of the &amp; apos ; Name change &amp; apos ; debate which led to the establishment of the Socialist Party , Taaffe argued in 1995 : &amp; quot ; To merely repeat statements and formulas , drawn up at one period , but which events have overtaken , is clearly wrong &amp; quot ; and that it would be fatal &amp; quot ; to put forward abstract formulas as a substitute for concrete demands , clear slogans , which arise from the experiences of the masses themselves &amp; quot ; .
Briefly discussing Trotsky &amp; apos ; s demands regarding factory committees , Taaffe comments that : &amp; quot ; The shop stewards committees embody the very idea of &amp; apos ; factory committees &amp; apos ; advocated by Trotsky &amp; quot ; . The Socialist Party is a membership based organisation , with branches in localities where it has members .
The annual Conference or Congress is the decisive body of the party .
Branches send delegates ( the number of delegates per branch is proportional to the size of the branch ) , to regional and national bodies , conferences and decision making annual congresses . At the annual congresses the national organisers have only a consultative vote , and must win support for new policies .
The exit from the Labour Party in 1991 , and the change of name of &amp; quot ; Militant Labour &amp; quot ; to &amp; quot ; Socialist Party &amp; quot ; , are two major debates in which a substantial exchange of views took place in a period of discussion and debate at branch , regional and national level , with a number of documents circulated , before a Congress at which the matter was concluded by a vote .
After a conference decision , members are generally expected to abide by the views agreed upon , at least publicly , whilst discussion may continue , or be returned to later , within the party until all concerns are addressed . Congress elects a National Committee , which in turn elects an Executive Committee of around a dozen or so members which runs the party on a day-to-day basis .
Peter Taaffe is general secretary , and Hannah Sell deputy general secretary .
In 2007 the Socialist Party Executive Committee of ten or eleven has a majority of women members .
Areas of responsibility for the executive apart from the development of general policy matters are various campaigning roles , such as NHS , workplace and youth campaigns , together with editorial responsibilities for &amp; quot ; The Socialist &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Socialism Today &amp; quot ; and other issues such as finance raising . The Socialist Party argues that its method of elections to the National Committee does not promote individuals , but instead is conceived as the selection of a rounded-out team , including both experienced as well as young or less experienced but promising members , together with members from the trade unions and youth and other aspects of the Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s work .
Each geographical region of the Socialist Party is felt to be in need of inclusion .
In general , the Executive Committee , after a period of discussion with regional representatives , presents to the National Committee its &amp; quot ; slate &amp; quot ; or list of members selected from all aspects of work of the party .
After any amendments from the National Committee , this list is proposed by the outgoing National Committee to the annual congress . In general , in presenting the slate to annual congress , the proposed members are listed primarily by region of the country , with an additional list of trade union and youth members , along with other variations from time to time .
A session of conference is usually set aside to discuss the slate , with an executive member explaining the reasoning behind the list , and outlining the proposed changes , followed by contributions to the discussion by delegates . Congress can approve , amend or reject the list , proposing an alternative .
From time to time in the history of Militant , the forerunner of the Socialist Party , this list has been amended at conference , although in the view of the Socialist Party , the inclusive approach of the consultation process makes this rare , and has not happened at Socialist Party congresses so far . The Socialist Party argues that this method is an example of aspects of genuine Democratic centralism , where the widest democratic discussion and debate takes place to attempt to reach agreement before any formal meeting takes place , followed by a meeting and a vote , after which , especially in times of serious struggle , the party is expected to pull together in the direction agreed .
In a document written by General Secretary Peter Taaffe in 1996 for the Socialist Party &amp; apos ; s predecessor Militant Labour , Taaffe suggests that the term &amp; quot ; democratic centralism &amp; quot ; has &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; u &amp; # 93 ; nfortunately &amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; been partially discredited , the concept mangled and distorted by Stalinism in particular .
It has come to mean , for uninformed people , something entirely opposite to its original meaning &amp; quot ; .
Taaffe argues that the : &amp; quot ; right-wing Labour leadership who usually hurl insults against the Marxists on the alleged undemocratic character of &amp; apos ; democratic centralism &amp; apos ; themselves actually practice an extreme form of &amp; apos ; bureaucratic centralism &amp; apos ; , as the experience of the witch-hunt against Militant and others on the left in the Labour Party demonstrated . &amp; quot ; Discussing the perceived &amp; apos ; dangers &amp; apos ; of democratic centralism , Taaffe has argued that according to Leon Trotsky there are no guarantees in any form of organisation which can guard against malpractice and the form of organisation that a party takes has a material origin that reflects the circumstances it finds itself in , as well as how it orientates to them . : &amp; quot ; The regime of a party does not fall ready made from the sky but is formed gradually in the struggle .
A political line predominates over the regime . &amp; quot ; Taaffe has also written , &amp; apos ; Trotsky then makes a fundamental point : &amp; quot ; Only a correct policy can guarantee a healthy party regime . &amp; quot ; &amp; apos ; The Socialist Party has a number of members in leading trade union positions , including PCS President Janice Godrich , USDAW President Amy Murphy , PCS Assistant General Secretary Chris Baugh , PCS Vice-President John McInally , former POA General Secretary Brian Caton , current POA Assistant General Secretary Joe Simpson and UNISON NEC member Roger Bannister amongst others .
In 2014 , the Socialist Party had 34 members on trade union national executive committees .
It is particularly influential in the Public and Commercial Services Union ( PCS ) . A number of Socialist Party members have also held key positions in workplaces where disputes have taken place , such as Keith Gibbson who was elected to the Lindsey Oil Refinery strike committee and Rob Williams who was trade union convenor at the Linamar car parts plant in Swansea , and is now the party &amp; apos ; s industrial organizer .
EntryismEntryism ( also referred to as entrism or enterism , or as infiltration ) is a political strategy in which an organisation or state encourages its members or supporters to join another , usually larger , organisation in an attempt to expand influence and expand their ideas and program .
In situations where the organization being &amp; quot ; entered &amp; quot ; is hostile to entrism , the entrists may engage in a degree of subterfuge and subversion to hide the fact that they are an organisation in their own right . Horton ( 2014 ) gives the &amp; quot ; example of entryism – the infiltration of a self-proclaimed human rights activist into an institution committed to neoliberalism , a market fundamentalism that has been credited with eroding health systems in dozens of low and middle-income countries &amp; quot ; .
Leslie ( 1999 ) uses the example of gender : &amp; quot ; alternative , yet complementary , strategies of &amp; apos ; entryism &amp; apos ; , with attempts to enter and transform these institutions &amp; apos ; gender inequalities from within ( as missionaries ) &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; French Turn &amp; quot ; refers to the classic form of entrism advocated by Leon Trotsky in his essays on &amp; quot ; the French Turn &amp; quot ; .
In June 1934 , he proposed that the French Trotskyists dissolve their Communist League to join the French Section of the Workers &amp; apos ; International ( SFIO ) and that it also dissolve its youth section to join more easily with revolutionary elements .
The tactic was adopted in August 1934 , despite some opposition .
The turn successfully raised the group &amp; apos ; s membership to 300 activists . Proponents of the tactic advocated that the Trotskyists should enter the social democratic parties to connect with revolutionary socialist currents within them , and steer those currents toward Leninism .
However , entry lasted only for a brief period : the leadership of the SFIO started to expel the Trotskyists .
The Trotskyists of the Workers Party of the United States also successfully used their entry into the Socialist Party of America to recruit their youth group and other members .
Similar tactics were also used by Trotskyist organisations in other countries , including The Netherlands , Belgium , Switzerland and Poland .
Entrism was used to connect with and recruit leftward-moving political currents inside radical parties . Since the turn in France , Marxists have used the tactic even if they had different preconceptions of how long the period of entry would last . In these types of entrism , entrists engage in a long-term perspective in which they work within an organisation for decades in hopes of gaining influence and a degree of power and perhaps even control of the larger organisation . In entryism &amp; quot ; sui generis &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; of a special type &amp; quot ; ) , Trotskyists , for example , do not openly argue for the building of a Trotskyist party .
&amp; quot ; Deep entryism &amp; quot ; refers to the long duration . The tactic is closely identified with Michel Pablo and Gerry Healy , who were leaders of the Fourth International in the late 1940s and 1950s .
The &amp; quot ; deep entry &amp; quot ; tactic was developed as a way for Trotskyists to respond to the Cold War .
In countries where there were mass social democratic or communist parties , it was as difficult to be accepted into these parties as Trotskyist currents as to build separate Trotskyist parties .
Therefore , Trotskyists were advised to join the mass party . In Europe , this was the approach used , for example , by The Club and later Socialist Action in the Labour Party , and by Fourth Internationalists inside the Communist Parties .
In France , Trotskyist organizations , most notably the &amp; quot ; Parti des Travailleurs &amp; quot ; and its predecessors , have successfully entered trade unions and mainstream left-wing parties . Some political parties , such as the Workers &amp; apos ; Party in Brazil or the Scottish Socialist Party , allow political tendencies to openly organise within them .
In these cases the term entryism is not usually used .
Political groups which work within a larger organisation but also maintain a &amp; quot ; public face &amp; quot ; often reject the term &amp; quot ; entrism &amp; quot ; but are nevertheless sometimes considered to be entryists by the larger organisation . In Australia , the practice was widespread during the 1950s , where Communists battled against right-wing &amp; apos ; Groupers &amp; apos ; , for control of Australian trade unions .
The Groupers subsequently formed the Democratic Labor Party .
Today the practice in Australia is often known as a type of branch stacking . In recent times RSPCA Australia has been described as being the victims of the practice .
The National Farmers &amp; apos ; Federation and Animals Australia have each been accused of infiltrating branches of RSPCA Australia in an attempt to promote opposing policies concerning battery hens , intensive pig farming , and the live export of sheep . Since the 2000s the religious right has been practicing entryism into a number of state branches of the Liberal Party of Australia , notably in New South Wales , Western Australia , Queensland and Victoria . Although the term entryism was used little if at all , opponents accused David Orchard and his supporters of attempting to win the leadership of the former Progressive Conservative Party in the late 1990s and early 2000s ( decade ) with the intention of dramatically changing its policies . Orchard had made his name as a leading opponent of free trade , which was perhaps &amp; quot ; the &amp; quot ; singular signature policy of the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
While opponents pointed to this remarkable distance , Orchard and his supporters argued that they represented &amp; quot ; traditional &amp; quot ; Tory values and economic nationalism that the &amp; quot ; older &amp; quot ; Conservative Party , and the Progressive Conservative party before Mulroney , had espoused , namely that of John Diefenbaker . Opponents of the 2003 merger between the Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance parties also charged Alliance members with infiltration .
It was widely speculated that most , if not all of the approximately 25,000 Canadians who swelled the PC Party &amp; apos ; s membership before the merger vote were Alliance members .
They would likely have voted in favour of the merger . Liberals for Life , a pro-life group allied with the Campaign Life Coalition , was accused of infiltrating the Liberal Party of Canada in the late 1980s and early 1990s . Members of Socialist Action , a small Trotskyist group , play a leading role in the New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus , a small faction on the left wing of that social democratic party , and advocate that their members join and engage with the NDP .
This however does not fit with most definitions of entryism due to their continued existence apart and separate from the NDP in addition to their work there .
Fightback , a rival Trotskyist organization , carries out a more classical form of entryism in the NDP , particularly in its youth wings , modelling itself after the British Militant tendency which practiced entryism in the Labour Party and which at its peak was the one of the most successful entryist organizations on record . After the fall of Social Credit in British Columbia , the British Columbia Liberal Party saw the shift of former Social Credit members into the BC Liberal party .
As a result , the new membership saw the party shift much more towards the right on fiscal policy .
In this way , entryism led to a complete takeover of the original party by former Social Credit members .
This however isn &amp; apos ; t formal entryism as former Social Credit members did not operate their own organization within the Liberal Party . During the Warlord Era in China , the Chinese Communists joined the party of the Chinese Nationalists for a time ( 1923 – 1927 ) , creating the First United Front against warlordism , but one of the Communists &amp; apos ; ideas behind doing so was that they might eventually gain a majority in that party and shape its policies .
Eventually the situation degraded , the Nationalists expelled the Communists from their party , and the Chinese Civil War began .
The latter war was paused for a time ( 1936 – 1945 ) to allow for a Second United Front during the Chinese resistance to Japanese imperial rule .
However , the civil war resumed again and remained active until 1950 . The Marxist-Leninist Party of the Netherlands was a fake pro-China communist party in the Netherlands set up by the Dutch secret service BVD to develop contacts with the Chinese government for espionage purposes .
It existed from 1968 to the early 1990s . The country &amp; apos ; s four small Communist parties the Communist Party of New Zealand ( CPNZ ) , Socialist Unity Party ( SUP ) , Workers Communist League ( WCL ) , and the Socialist Action League ( SAL ) have tried to influence the Labour Party , the trade unions , and various popular issues like the anti-Springbok tour protests , the Māori biculturalism , and the anti-nuclear movement .
During the ANZUS diplomatic crisis 1984-85 which resulted from NZ &amp; apos ; s nuclear ship ban , the pro-Moscow SUP tried to infiltrate anti-nuclear organisations as part of a strategy of steering New Zealand &amp; apos ; s foreign policy away from its traditional ally the United States . New Zealand &amp; apos ; s Christian Right also attempted to obtain electoral influence .
During the 1987 general election , several conservative Christian groups including the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children ( SPUC ) , Women for Life and the Coalition of Concerned Citizens tried to infiltrate the National Party by running conservative Christian individuals as candidates .
These groups also attacked the Labour government &amp; apos ; s policies towards peace education , sex education , abortion , Maori biculturalism , and the ANZUS alliance .
Several CCC supporters contested the 1987 election as National candidates including Rob Wheeler ( Mount Albert ) , Andrew Stanley ( Onehunga ) , and Howard Martin ( Papatoetoe ) .
However , these efforts met little electoral success and the Lange government was re-elected for a second term . During the 1990s , another conservative tendency emerged within the National Party through the establishment of the informal Christian Voice group in 1998 .
However , it had faded by the mid-2000s when several minor Christian political parties including former National MP Graeme Lee &amp; apos ; s Christian Democrat Party , Peter Dunne &amp; apos ; s United Future , and Brian Tamaki &amp; apos ; s Destiny New Zealand emerged to court the evangelical Christian vote .
As a result of these attempts at taking over the party , National quietly centralised its candidate selection procedures . Despite these tensions with moral conservatives , National Party leader Don Brash still accepted covert assistance from the Exclusive Brethren during the 2005 general elections .
This assistance included organizing a separate electoral canvassing and advertising campaign which attacked the incumbent Labour and Green coalition government .
This strategy backfired and contributed to Prime Minister Helen Clark &amp; apos ; s second re-election .
Due to the controversy arising from the Exclusive Brethren &amp; apos ; s canvassing on behalf of National , Brash &amp; apos ; s successor Prime Minister John Key explicitly rejected any assistance from the Exclusive Brethren during the 2008 election . A long-lasting entry tactic was used by the Militant tendency ( a Trotskyist group ) , whose initially very small number of supporters worked within the Labour Party from the 1960s .
By the early-1980s , though still only numbered in the low thousands , they had managed to gain a controlling influence of the Labour Party Young Socialists and Liverpool City Council , but almost simultaneously Militant activists began to be expelled after an internal Labour ruling that their organisation breached the party &amp; apos ; s constitution .
A remnant of the group now operates within the Labour Party as Socialist Appeal but the ( then ) majority left to form the Socialist Party ( England and Wales ) . &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; columnist George Monbiot claims that a group influenced by the defunct Marxist &amp; quot ; Living Marxism &amp; quot ; magazine have pursued entryist tactics amongst scientific and media organisations in the UK , since the late 1990s . The 2015 Labour leadership election in the United Kingdom was the target of a campaign by &amp; quot ; The Daily Telegraph &amp; quot ; for Conservative sympathisers to join the Labour party as £ 3 supporters in order to vote for the left wing candidate Jeremy Corbyn , with the view this would render the party un-electable .
This strategy was labelled &amp; apos ; entryism &amp; apos ; by observers . Another example of charges of entryism involving the United States Reform Party involved supporters of Fred Newman and the New Alliance Party joining the Reform Party &amp; quot ; en masse &amp; quot ; and gaining some level of control over the New York State affiliate of the Reform Party .
Another United States politician , Lyndon LaRouche , has attempted an entryist strategy in the Democratic Party since 1980 , but with little success .
The Democratic Socialists of America pursues reforms generally through the modus operandi of the US Democratic Party , rather than establishing itself as a third party .
Many Libertarians or libertarian-leaning politicians have run for office as Republicans , and several have been successful .
Duke Huan of ZhengDuke Huan of Zheng ( ) , was the founder of the state of Zheng during the early Zhou Dynasty of ancient China .
According to the Records of the Grand Historian , he was the son of King Li of Zhou .
His ancestral name was Ji ( 姬 ) , given name You ( 友 ) , and Duke Huan was his posthumous name . In 806 BC , he was bestowed the land of Zheng ( northwest of modern Hua County , Shaanxi ) by King Xuan of Zhou .
In 773 BC , the 33rd year of the reign of Duan Huan of Zheng , King You of Zhou gave him the position of &amp; quot ; situ &amp; quot ; ( Minister of Land ) due to the people &amp; apos ; s love for him . Due to the instability during the rule of King You of Zhou , Duke Huan of Zheng consulted Taishi Bo ( 太史伯 ) on his opinions on state relocation .
Duke Huan expressed that he wished to move the country to the west or to the Yangtze River Basin .
Taishi Bo indicated that establishing a country in the west would not last long since the people of the west were avaricious and greedy , and that establishing a country in the Yangtze River Basin would be unfavourable for the country since the state of Chu was expanding in the south .
In the end , Duke Huan listened to the advice of Taishi Bo and moved the country to the east of Luoyang , south of the Yellow River and the Ji River ( 濟河 ) , and named it New Zheng ( 新鄭 ) . After relocating the country , other nearby states such as the state of Kuai ( 鄶 ) and Guo offered Duke Huan ten cities , which were incorporated into the land of his country . In 771 BC , the 45th of his reign , the Quanrong attacked the Zhou capital Haojing and killed both King Xuan of Zhou and Duke Huan of Zheng .
His son , Juetu ( 掘突 ) assumed the throne as Duke Wu of Zheng .

It was written and produced by Lukasz &amp; quot ; Dr .
Luke &amp; quot ; Gottwald , Joshua &amp; quot ; Ammo &amp; quot ; Coleman , Henry &amp; quot ; Cirkut &amp; quot ; Walter , with additional writing from Bonnie McKee , Jacob Kasher Hindlin , Lola Blanc , and Fransisca Hall . &amp; quot ; Ooh La La &amp; quot ; was written by Ammo , Fransisca Hall , and Lola Blanc , and was intended to become Blanc &amp; apos ; s debut single as it was a play on her name .

He collaborated with additional writers Cirkut , Jacob Kasher , and Bonnie McKee to rewrite some lyrics into a more child-friendly nature .
Production was handled by Dr .
Luke , Cirkut , and Ammo .
Spears decided to record this song to contribute to the soundtrack of &amp; quot ; The Smurfs 2 &amp; quot ; because , in her own words , she &amp; quot ; always loved the Smurfs as a kid and now my boys are the biggest Smurfs fans EVER .
I wanted to surprise them with a song in the movie .
I know they &amp; apos ; ll think it &amp; apos ; s Smurftastic ! &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; Ooh La La &amp; quot ; is a synthpop song .
Writing for E ! Online , Alexis L .
Loinaz described the song as &amp; quot ; vintage Britney &amp; quot ; , with an &amp; quot ; oddly folksy pop-tart twist . &amp; quot ; Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed it a &amp; quot ; sweet , slight , little love song &amp; quot ; which is about &amp; quot ; loving someone for their true blue self . &amp; quot ; It begins as a &amp; quot ; pure pop &amp; quot ; song mixed with electronica .
The song then transitions , with Spears &amp; quot ; speak-singing , Kesha style &amp; quot ; , over an electroclash beat .
This is followed by an acoustic-guitar-driven section , which , according to Newman , is &amp; quot ; fluffy , retro pop &amp; quot ; , similar to Madonna in the early 1980s .
&amp; quot ; Ooh La La &amp; quot ; contains a &amp; quot ; compelling breakdown &amp; quot ; , which is &amp; quot ; full of scrambled vocals &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; dense beats &amp; quot ; , that lasts for a duration of 30 seconds .
Spears &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; whimsical vocals &amp; quot ; contain &amp; quot ; catchy ditty layers . &amp; quot ; Singer Katy Perry revealed during the film &amp; apos ; s premiere that she , along with co-writer Bonnie McKee , provided some background vocals on the song . &amp; quot ; Ooh La La &amp; quot ; received generally positive response from critics .
&amp; quot ; Rolling Stone &amp; quot ; s Dan Reilly highlighted the song &amp; apos ; s catchiness , writing &amp; quot ; now that you &amp; apos ; ve heard it , try and get it out of your head &amp; quot ; .
An editor from &amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; magazine described the track as a &amp; quot ; sweet spot of sugary synth-pop &amp; quot ; , adding that the song is &amp; quot ; highlighted by a compelling breakdown , full of scrambled vocals and dense beats . &amp; quot ; Brian Mansfield of &amp; quot ; USA Today &amp; quot ; stated that &amp; quot ; Momma Spears &amp; apos ; kid-friendly track is energetic to the point of hyperactivity , caroming from a rap section to an acoustic-guitar-driven chorus to a buzzy electronic breakdown .
Smurftastic ? Maybe . &amp; quot ; Jenna Hally Rubenstein from MTV News was enthusiastic about the song , describing it as a &amp; quot ; bright , sunshiny pop jam that perfectly caters to the Smurfs 2 demographic . &amp; quot ; A reviewer from Take 40 Australia wrote that &amp; quot ; the tune is pure Britney and we are absolutely loving it . &amp; quot ; In 2014 , &amp; quot ; Ooh La La &amp; quot ; was nominated for two Radio Disney Music Awards for Best Song That Makes You Smile and Favorite Song from a Movie or a TV Show .
The ceremony took place on 26 , April 2014 , with the song winning the award for Best Song That Makes You Smile . The music video was filmed in June and was directed by Marc Klasfeld .

The video premiered on Spears &amp; apos ; Vevo channel at 12PM ET on July 11 , 2013 .
MSN Music described the opening scene from the video as an homage to the video for Janet Jackson &amp; apos ; s 1986 song &amp; quot ; Nasty &amp; quot ; , stating that &amp; quot ; the clip plays out like a more kid-friendly version of Janet Jackson &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Nasty &amp; quot ; video , with Spears and her kids taking in a movie when mom is suddenly transported into the on-screen action . &amp; quot ; The video features Spears and her son &amp; apos ; s watching &amp; apos ; The Smurfs 2 &amp; apos ; in a theater and as Gargamel zaps Spears , she finds herself in Smurf village singing and dancing with the smurfs .
The music video heavily samples clips of the movie .

Drawn in group 1 for the group stage , they won four and drew one of their games in this single round-robin stage , a point ahead of Yeedzin Their + 22 goal difference was aided by a 6 – 0 win over RC Cables and an 11 victory against Veterans FC .
they defeated Sharks FC 6 – 2 in the semi final of the knock-out stage and then beat Yeedzin 5 – 3 on penalties after a 1 – 1 draw following extra time , and were promoted to the A-Division for the following season . In their first season in the A-Division , they finished second from bottom , finishing only above Druk United .
Details for this season are scant , but it is known that as well as drawing two of their games , their solitary victory in the season was a 7 – 3 win against Druk United . No details exist to indicate how Rigzhung performed in the 2004 season , but the next season for which full records are available show they again finished in penultimate place in the relegation zone .
They entered the relegation playoffs with Dzongree from the A-Division and Choden and another unknown team from the B-Division .
there is little in the way of information about these matches , but Rigzhung must have been successful as they competed again in the A-Division the following season , although their only known result was a 9 – 0 loss to Transport United . In the 2007 season , Rigzhung finished bottom of the A-Division , winning just a single game from their fourteen matches and losing all the rest .
they again entered the relegation playoffs , this time with RIHS against the top two teams from the B-Division : Veterans and Wolfland .
They won 2 and lost one of their games ( to Veterans ) , doing enough to secure another seasonin the A-Division . The following season saw them bottom of the league with no points at all at the halfway stage of the competition , having lost all seven of their games by that stage , although none of their results are known .
Their second half performance was ultimately moot , as no teams were relegated or promoted in the A-Division at the end of the season . In 2009 , they were saved from last place as Royal Bhutan Army withdrew halfway through the season ( having already amassed more than three times the points that Rigzhung did all season by that stage ) , though this time they were relegated , without going through any playoffs .
Rigzhung suffered some heavy defeats that season , losing 13 – 0 and 11 – 0 to eventual champions Druk Star and 10 – 2 and 9 – 2 to Yeedzin .
The next time records show the performance of Rigzhung , they were playing in the B-Division again in 2012 and 2013 .

State 194 ( film ) State 194 is a 2012 documentary film about the pursuit for Palestinian statehood .
The film is written , directed , and produced by Israeli filmmaker Dan Setton .
The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on , 2012 .
It had a limited release in theaters in the United States on , 2013 . The documentary follows the plan that Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad puts forth in 2009 for the Palestinians to achieve statehood .
It follows the progress made by the Palestinians but also &amp; quot ; the political quagmire &amp; quot ; that threatens the progress .
The documentary shows the following people : The film is directed by Dan Setton and produced by Setton and Elise Pearlstein .
Setton heard Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad make a radio address in 2009 and thought that Fayyad &amp; apos ; s plan to build social services and economic infrastructure was a similar path to the Zionist movement that led to the creation of Israel .
Setton met Fayyad in 2009 shortly before the filmmakers began filming the documentary .
He began filming with the support of the French company Zagib Productions .
He soon approached Participant Media for backing , and the company expanded the film &amp; apos ; s production and advised the filmmaker to increase its scope .
They attached producer Elise Pearlstein to work with Setton .
Filming took place in several cities in the West Bank , including Ramallah .
They featured two Palestinian bloggers , Madj Biltaji from the West Bank , and Mahmoud El-Madawi from Gaza , to show grassroots activists using social networks . Pearlstein said the filmmakers did not know the outcome of Fayyad &amp; apos ; s plan , &amp; quot ; We were trying to make sure the film served as a historical documentation of the time when change felt really possible . &amp; quot ; They sought to show nonviolent images of the conflict : &amp; quot ; There &amp; apos ; s no blood in this film .
It &amp; apos ; s all about the constructive building of institutions and a political movement . &amp; quot ; Setton said of the conflict &amp; apos ; s complex reality , &amp; quot ; We tried to make it as clear as possible for the many underinformed people that are in our audience . &amp; quot ; The filmmakers used aerial shots and wide shots for the documentary ; Setton said , &amp; quot ; We thought it would be a good cinematic approach to rise up from the day-to-day little things and show a bigger picture . &amp; quot ; Salam Fayyad resigned in April 2013 , a month before the documentary &amp; apos ; s theatrical release .
When the &amp; quot ; Los Angeles Times &amp; quot ; asked Setton about Fayyad &amp; apos ; s resignation affecting the prospects of statehood , the director said , &amp; quot ; There was a loss of momentum even before his resignation .
I ’ ve spoken with him recently , and he said he resigned his job but he hasn ’ t resigned his mission .
He will push Palestinians to continue working on what he believes will create the conditions of statehood . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; State 194 &amp; quot ; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on , 2012 .
The Palestinian Prime Minister depicted in the documentary , Salam Fayyad , was scheduled to appear at a news conference at the film festival with Setton , producer Elise Pearlstein , and representatives of The Parents Circle-Families Forum , but Sallah was detained in Ramallah when demonstrations broke out among Palestinians over high prices in the occupied territories .
The documentary also screened at the Berlin International Film Festival on , 2013 .
It had a limited release on , 2013 in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles . Mark Adams of &amp; quot ; Screen Daily &amp; quot ; reviewed &amp; quot ; State 194 &amp; quot ; at its Berlin screening and called it &amp; quot ; a highly watchable and impressively optimistic documentary &amp; quot ; .
He spoke of its distribution potential , &amp; quot ; The film . . .
is made with enthusiasm and passion , and would be a suitably provocative and challenging transmission for broadcasters .
Technical qualities are okay , but this is the sort of project where content and context are everything . &amp; quot ; Anita Gates , reviewing for &amp; quot ; The New York Times &amp; quot ; , called &amp; quot ; State 194 &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; an intelligent , evenhanded Israeli documentary &amp; quot ; .
Gates compared the film to a &amp; quot ; 60 Minutes &amp; quot ; TV segment &amp; quot ; without the confrontational interview style &amp; quot ; .
For her , the film &amp; apos ; s different elements &amp; quot ; lay out the situation but offer little new insight &amp; quot ; .
She said , &amp; quot ; Sadly , the overall effect of &amp; apos ; State 194 &amp; apos ; is a fresh wave of frustration and discouragement over a heartbreaking and seemingly insurmountable political standoff and its human toll . &amp; quot ; Gary Goldstein of the &amp; quot ; Los Angeles Times &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; This globe-hopping film offers an easily digestible look at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , past and present , while framing the roles of its recent key players . &amp; quot ; Goldstein said the film focused on &amp; quot ; the seemingly level-headed , optimistic Fayyad &amp; quot ; as he pushes for statehood .
He concluded , &amp; quot ; With a two-state solution still elusive , &amp; apos ; State 194 &amp; apos ; may feel a bit like yesterday &amp; apos ; s news — literally and figuratively .
But as an aid to better understanding this vital , complex dispute , the film is definitely worth a look . &amp; quot ; Mike D &amp; apos ; Angelo of &amp; quot ; The A . V .
Club &amp; quot ; said the documentary was unnecessary for moviegoers who have a basic understanding of the Israeli – Palestinian conflict .
D &amp; apos ; Angelo said , &amp; quot ; As a primer , however , the film does the job , albeit less thoroughly and with more needless digressions than would even a lengthy magazine article on the subject . &amp; quot ; The critic thought the documentary easily summarized Fayyad &amp; apos ; s plan and spent too much time recording the prime minister at photo ops .
D &amp; apos ; Angelo said , &amp; quot ; Ultimately , &amp; quot ; State 194 &amp; quot ; wants to rally viewers to the cause of a two-state solution , and that entails glossing over many of the reasons why it hasn &amp; apos ; t already happened , in spite of it being in almost everybody ’ s best interest . &amp; quot ;

Palacio de San CarlosThe San Carlos Palace ( ; previously Colegio Seminario de San Bartolomé ) , is a 16th-century Neoclassical mansion in Bogotá , Colombia .
Located on the corner of Calle 10 and Carrera 5 , the historic building has been the site of various political , social and academic events .
Since December 1993 , it has been home to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . The Palace of San CarlosThe history of the building goes back to the end of the 16th century when it was built by Archdeacon Francisco Porras Mejia , in 1585 .
At the time Santa Fe de Bogotá was the capital of New Kingdom of Granada , part of the Viceroyalty of Peru .
It was occupied by the archdeacon &amp; apos ; s family until 1605 when it was sold to Archbishop Bartolomé Lobo Guerrero who used it as a Jesuit seminary known as the Colegio Seminario de San Bartolomé .
In 1739 , the first printing press of Sante Fe was also established here .
In 1767 , after the Jesuits were expelled from New Granada by Francisco Antonio Moreno y Escandón , acting on orders from King Carlos III , it became the Royal Library of Santa Fe and served as barracks for the Presidential Guard .
From 1827 to 1908 the palace was the official residence of the President of Colombia .
Then President Rafael Reyes Prieto moved out to the Palace of Nariño where he lived till 1954 .
From 1954 it again became the residence of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla and his successors till 1980 .
In 1980 after the Palace of Nariño was inaugurated as the presidential residence , the Palace of San Carlos was converted to house the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which it still accommodates today . The palace was also the scene of an assassination attempt on Simon Bolivar in 1828 .
He was attacked when a group of conspirators attempted to assassinate him while he was taking a bath and he escaped through the window with soap still covering his body .
His mistress , Manuela Sáenz Aizpuru , who tipped him off and saved him came to be known among Bogotans as &amp; quot ; the liberator of the liberator &amp; quot ; .
The event became known as the &amp; quot ; Noche Septembrina &amp; quot ; ( , and it is referenced in Latin in a plaque conspicuously fixed on the wall next to the window through which he escaped .
In 1937 , properties next to the palace were acquired on the eastern side .
The main entrance was added along with a triple storied building to accommodate the offices of the Ministry .
Built by the Italian architect Pietro Cantini , the new façade stands close to two other historic buildings on Calle del Coliseo ( Calle 10 ) : the birthplace of the poet Rafael Pombo and the Christopher Columbus Theatre .
On 11 August 1975 , the San Carlos Palace was declared a National Monument . The Palace is built around a central courtyard with Tuscan columns and slightly pointed arches .
On the south side of the courtyard there is a stairway up to the first floor .
The original stone entrance with a balcony and iron railings is preserved as part of the façade .
There are two rows of rectangular windows including the one on the east side through which Bolívar escaped on 25 September 1828 .
From 1937 to 1942 , the building was adapted for future use by the architects Hernando González Varona and Manuel de Vengoechea . On 9 April 1948 , the palace was attacked during the Bogotazo which caused damage to its interiors . The building has been completely restored to serve as a heritage site and as a venue for diplomatic receptions and special events .
It is known for its elegant state rooms .
In its patios , there is a walnut planted by Bolívar and a palm which President José Hilario López Valdés planted to commemorate the birth of his daughter Policarpa . The large entrance hall displays six 18th-century Spanish chairs in the Cordoba style and a central table .
Two large 19th-century bronze vases flank the stairway at the far end .
Bolivar &amp; apos ; s bedroom is furnished with a 17th-century bed and a bargueño desk with secret drawers .
The neighbouring oratory with works from the Santa Fe school and an altar in the colonial style with two florally decorated candelabras .
Since colonial times , the Bolívar Room opposite the bedroom has been a venue for important official ceremonies .
It houses a portrait of Bolívar by the Venezuelan artist Antonio Salguero Salas and a fireplace with two Solomonic columns . The ceiling in the entrance to the state rooms is decorated with a Pompeian fresco by Santiago Martínez Delgado ( 1950 ) .
The large Audience Hall features a carpet with a hunting scene and carved wooden chairs with a gold-leaf finish .
The Cabinet Room accommodates a flag of the United States of Colombia from 1863 . The Francisco de Paula Santander Room which is traditionally used as a reception hall for formal events .
Its gold-toned walls bear damasks from Italy .
A giant rococo mirror complements the two colonial tables .
There is a painting of the Virgin and Child from the Cuzco School and a 19th-century portrait of José Joaquín de Olmedo y Maruri , Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia , and later President of Ecuador , by A .
Castillanos .
The 18th-century furniture is from Spain .

The club moved south to the town centre in 1921 whilst Falkirk has been based in and around the town for its entire existence .
The former home grounds of the two clubs , Brockville Park and Firs Park , were separated by less than half a mile and games between the teams sometimes attracted larger crowds than their usual average attendances .
The last time the clubs competed in the same league was in 1981 – 82 and encounters since then have been rare ; the last competitive match was in 2015 in a Scottish League Cup first round match which Falkirk won 5 – 0 at Broadwood Stadium .

The largest victory in a major competition was 6 – 0 for Falkirk in the old Second Division in 1961 . Falkirk F . C .
was founded in 1876 whilst East Stirlingshire F . C .

Session ( web analytics ) In web analytics , a session , or visit is a unit of measurement of a user &amp; apos ; s actions taken within a period of time or with regard to completion of a task .
Sessions are also used in operational analytics and provision of user-specific recommendations .
There are two primary methods used to define a session : time-oriented approaches based on continuity in user activity and navigation-based approaches based on continuity in a chain of requested pages . The definition of &amp; quot ; session &amp; quot ; varies , particularly when applied to search engines .
Generally , a session is understood to consist of &amp; quot ; a sequence of requests made by a single end-user during a visit to a particular site &amp; quot ; .
In the context of search engines , &amp; quot ; sessions &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; query sessions &amp; quot ; have at least two definitions .
A session or query session may be all queries made by a user in a particular time period or it may also be a series of queries or navigations with a consistent underlying user need . Sessions per user can be used as a measurement of website usage .
Other metrics used within research and applied web analytics include session length , and user actions per session .
Session length is seen as a more accurate alternative to measuring page views . Reconstructed sessions have also been used to measure total user input , including to measure the number of labour hours taken to construct Wikipedia .
Sessions are also used for operational analytics , data anonymization , identifying networking anomalies , and synthetic workload generation for testing servers with artificial traffic . Essential to the use of sessions in web analytics is being able to identify them .
This is known as &amp; quot ; session reconstruction &amp; quot ; .
Approaches to session reconstruction can be divided into two main categories : time-oriented , and navigation-oriented . Time-oriented approaches to session reconstruction look for a set period of user inactivity commonly called an &amp; quot ; inactivity threshold . &amp; quot ; Once this period of inactivity is reached , the user is assumed to have left the site or stopped using the browser entirely and the session is ended .
Further requests from the same user are considered a second session .
A common value for the inactivity threshold is 30 minutes and sometimes described as the industry standard .
Some have argued that a threshold of 30 minutes produces artifacts around naturally long sessions and have experimented with other thresholds .
Others simply state : &amp; quot ; no time threshold is effective at identifying &amp; # 91 ; sessions &amp; # 93 ; &amp; quot ; . One alternative that has been proposed is using user-specific thresholds rather than a single , global threshold for the entire dataset .
This has the problem of assuming that the thresholds follow a bimodal distribution , and is not suitable for datasets that cover a long period of time . Navigation-oriented approaches exploit the structure of websites - specifically , the presence of hyperlinks and the tendency of users to navigate between pages on the same website by clicking on them , rather than typing the full URL into their browser .
One way of identifying sessions by looking at this data is to build a map of the website : if the user &amp; apos ; s first page can be identified , the &amp; quot ; session &amp; quot ; of actions lasts until they land on a page which cannot be accessed from any of the previously-accessed pages .
This takes into account backtracking , where a user will retrace their steps before opening a new page .
A simpler approach , which does not take backtracking into account , is to simply require that the HTTP referer of each request be a page that is already in the session .
If it is not , a new session is created .
This class of heuristics &amp; quot ; exhibits very poor performance &amp; quot ; on websites that contain framesets .

Mario &amp; amp ; amp ; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter GamesThis game formed the second part in Sega &amp; apos ; s exclusivity agreement with Nintendo after &amp; quot ; Sonic Lost World &amp; quot ; back on mid-October 2013 but followed by &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; on November / December 2014 .
Subsequently , a sequel game — &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; amp ; Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games &amp; quot ; — was announced for release in February 2016 . The players can only choose one of twenty characters that return from the previous two games and participate in a series of sixteen Olympic events .
Events are controlled either using the Wii Remote MotionPlus and Nunchuk controllers , or the Wii U GamePad , with some events , such as the biathlon , utilizing both control methods , for the Wii U version .
Along with returning events , such as skiing , bobsledding and curling , new events include figure skating pairs and snowboarding slope style .
Like in the previous games , players can also participate in one of eight fictional Dream Events , including a new mixed event in which cases can be simultaneously played with snowboarding , skiing and bobsledding players .
These events are played in places from the &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Sonic &amp; quot ; franchises .
A new addition to this game is the Action &amp; amp ; Answer Tour , where players answer questions to score points while competing in various events hosted by Orbot and Cubot from &amp; quot ; Sonic Colors &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Sonic Lost World &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; amp ; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games &amp; quot ; received generally mixed reviews , with most critics praising the visuals and the online mode , but criticising the game &amp; apos ; s similarity to previous &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; amp ; Sonic series &amp; quot ; games and motion controls .
It has an aggregate score of 54 . 81 % on GameRankings and 55 / 100 at Metacritic . Gaz Plant of Nintendo Life gave the game 6 out of 10 , summarising that it &amp; quot ; . . . feels like a minor progression , and not the huge leap you might be expecting .
Taking a lot of its cues from the 2010 game , and ignoring the rapid-fire party experience of 2012 , this latest edition hits some of the right buttons , but they &amp; apos ; re the same unremarkable buttons that were hit four years ago .
The inclusion of online is certainly welcome , but too limited , while the inventive TV idea used on the GamePad is never taken far enough .
But that said , with a group of friends , there &amp; apos ; s still a lot of fun to be had here ; it &amp; apos ; s just hard to shake that feeling that you &amp; apos ; ve done it all before . &amp; quot ; Digital Spy &amp; apos ; s Liam Martin scored the game 3 out of 5 , praising the game &amp; apos ; s visuals , multiplayer aspects and family-friendly fun but commented on the game &amp; apos ; s lack of &amp; quot ; spark &amp; quot ; and progression in the &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; amp ; Sonic &amp; quot ; series , stating that &amp; quot ; When the action is go and games are in full swing , the game is a flashy and fun mini-game compilation for all of the family .
Despite some enjoyable multiplayer encounters , the game is lacking the sublime to go with the star power &amp; quot ; . IGN &amp; apos ; s Scott Thompson , gave the game 4 . 5 out of 10 ; praising the games online multiplayer but panned the games unresponsive motion controls ; summarising that &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; The game &amp; # 93 ; has some good ideas but it &amp; apos ; s weighed down by bad motion controls &amp; quot ; . David Jenkins of Metro was mostly negative towards the game , giving the game a 3 out of 10 .
Jenkins praised the games graphics but panned the game &amp; apos ; s lack of depth , inconsistent controls and recycled content , concluding that &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; This is &amp; # 93 ; the worst &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; amp ; Sonic &amp; quot ; game yet and not just a waste of a crossover , but a genuinely poor mini-game compilation and one that makes both the Wii U and the GamePad look bad &amp; quot ; .

Comprehension of idiomsComprehension of idioms is the act of processing and understanding idioms .
Idioms are a common type of figure of speech .
Based on common linguistic definitions , an idiom is a combination of words that contains a meaning that cannot be understood based on the literal definition of the individual words .
An example of an idiom is &amp; quot ; hit the sack &amp; quot ; , which means &amp; quot ; to go to bed &amp; quot ; .
It can be used in a sentence like the following : &amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; m so exhausted that I &amp; apos ; m going to hit the sack now &amp; quot ; . Traditionally , idiom comprehension was thought to require a distinct processing mode other than literal language comprehension .
Subsequent research suggested that the comprehension of idioms could be explained in the context of general models of comprehension .
Contemporary researchers have also posited that different modes of processing are required for distinct types of idioms .
Factors , such as idiom familiarity , transparency , and context are found to influence idiom comprehension .
Recent neurolinguistic research has found , using various techniques , several neural substrates that are associated with idiom comprehension , such as the left temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex . Psycholinguistic research in idiom comprehension began in the 1970s .
Early research on figurative language typically assumed that comprehending figurative and literal language involved different kinds of processes .
The non-compositional models of idiom comprehension were constructed based on this assumption .
Non-compositional models in general assume that idioms are stored like long words in memory .
For example , the entire phrase &amp; quot ; kick the bucket &amp; quot ; is represented by the meaning &amp; quot ; to die &amp; quot ; .
The words kick and bucket separately do not contribute to the idiomatic meaning .
Since individual words do not matter in an idiomatic expression , they are thought to be processed together as one entity during comprehension .
In contrast , processing a literal expression requires the meaning of each word to be derived and then perceived in relation to the other words in the phrase .
Non-compositional models include the &amp; quot ; literal first hypothesis &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; lexical representation hypothesis &amp; quot ; , and the &amp; quot ; direct access hypothesis &amp; quot ; .
The Literal First Hypothesis The Lexical Representation HypothesisThe Direct Access HypothesisThere are several criticisms for the non-compositional models .
&amp; quot ; First &amp; quot ; , studies demonstrated that idiom expressions are not processed more slowly than literal expression .
In fact , it is often the opposite , which is in contrary to the prediction of literal first hypothesis .
&amp; quot ; Second &amp; quot ; , idioms have been found to be more than just “ frozen phrases ” or long words .
For example , some idioms can be transformed to some extent and still be recognized and understood .
For example , &amp; quot ; spill the beans &amp; quot ; can be used as “ the beans were spilt by Mary ” .
This is possible because &amp; quot ; spill the bean &amp; quot ; can be mapped on the meaning “ reveal the secret ” , i . e .
&amp; quot ; spill &amp; quot ; ( reveal ) and &amp; quot ; beans &amp; quot ; ( secret ) .
Such idiom shows that the internal structure of the word string matters during comprehension .
The meaning of some idioms , like &amp; quot ; play with fire &amp; quot ; , can be also inferred from literal interpretation of their components ( i . e .
&amp; quot ; to do something dangerous &amp; quot ; ) .
These findings reveal that idioms are not a homogeneous , distinct group and thus may not involve different processing strategies from those for literal expressions . Compositional models assume that idiom comprehension uses normal language processing .
When an idiomatic expression is encountered , it is processed incrementally like a normal expression .
Components of an idiomatic word string contribute to a figurative meaning in either a literal or metaphorical way .
Compositional models include the &amp; quot ; configurational hypothesis &amp; quot ; and the &amp; quot ; conceptual metaphor hypothesis &amp; quot ; .
The Configurational HypothesisThe Conceptual Metaphor HypothesisThe prediction of the configurational hypothesis was not supported by research findings .
Researchers found that even after a word string is recognized as an idiom , its literal meaning is still activated .
Another criticism of the compositional models concerns the role of familiarity in idiom comprehension .
As discovered by research on non-compositional models , idiomatic expressions are processed faster than non-idiomatic expressions .
This is likely due to people ’ s familiarity of idioms .
This suggests that when highly familiar idioms are encountered , people may not need to engage in literal processing or utilize conceptual metaphor to infer their meanings . Research in idiom comprehension continues today .
Non-compositional and compositional models both inform contemporary researchers .
One of the recent models includes the dual idiom representation model . The Dual Idiom Representation ModelMany factors have an effect on the comprehension of idioms .
They can influence the processing speed and understandability of the idioms .
Some of these factors include the familiarity , transparency , and context of use of the idioms . Idiom familiarity is typically defined as how frequently an idiom is encountered in a language community .
Subjective ratings of idiom familiarity are usually obtained from members of the language community .
An example of a more familiar English idiom is &amp; quot ; pain in the neck &amp; quot ; , while a less familiar idiom is &amp; quot ; paddle his own canoe &amp; quot ; .
Research demonstrated that familiar idioms are processed quicker and more accurately than unfamiliar ones .
As the dual idiom representation model suggests , highly familiar idioms may lead to direct memory retrieval .
Processing unfamiliar idioms , on the other head , requires contextual information and commonsense knowledge . Idiom transparency can refer to the “ literalness ” of an idiom ; how easy it is to understand an idiom based on the words it contains .
Idioms can be sorted depending on their degree of transparency .
Three categories of idioms have been identified : &amp; quot ; decomposable &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; abnormally decomposable &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; nondecomposable &amp; quot ; .
Decomposable idioms are composed of words that literally contribute to their overall figurative meaning , e . g .
&amp; quot ; pop the question &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; Pop &amp; quot ; refers to &amp; quot ; sudden &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; the question &amp; quot ; refers to &amp; quot ; marriage proposal &amp; quot ; .
Abnormally decomposable idioms contain words that are associated with the overall figurative meaning of the idiom but in a metaphorical way , e . g .
&amp; quot ; spill the beans &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; Spill &amp; quot ; mapping on to &amp; quot ; reveal &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; beans &amp; quot ; metaphorically representing &amp; quot ; secret &amp; quot ; .
Nondecomposable idioms are made of words that do not reflect their idiomatic meaning , e . g .
&amp; quot ; kick the bucket &amp; quot ; .
People are found to respond to both types of decomposable idioms faster than nondecomposable ones . Research in children highlighted the important effects of context on idiom comprehension .
It was found that children understand idiomatic expression more accurately when they are shown in informative contexts than when they are presented in isolation .
When they are encountered out of context , children tended to interpret idioms literally .
The ability to use contextual information in language processing has also been found to influence children ’ s performance in idiom comprehension .
Adults , however , are more affected by the familiarity of the idiom . Researchers have used various means to explore the brain regions that are associated with idiom comprehension .
The investigations involve examining brain damage patients , and conducting transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) studies .
Brain damages in the patients were mostly caused by strokes or traumatic accidents .
rTMS causes temporary cerebral lesion , and thereby impairs the target area ’ s functioning .
fMRI measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow .
The areas that have been studied include the right hemisphere , left hemisphere , and prefrontal cortex . Since aphasic patients often preserve their ability to use familiar phrases ( i . e .
idioms and proverbs ) , researchers hypothesized that they may be stored and processed in different brain regions than novel phrases .
It was found that patients who experienced right-brain damage ( RBD ) showed more impairment in idiom comprehension than patients with left-brain damage ( LBD ) .
RBD patients however performed better in comprehending novel sentence compared to patients with LBD .
This suggests that the right hemisphere is involved in the comprehension of idioms .
However , later research has suggested that RBD patients ’ difficulties in idiom comprehension , as demonstrated by sentence-to-picture matching task , may be due to deficits in their visuospatial abilities , rather than impairment in linguistic processing .
The right hemisphere shows dominance in visuospatial processing . Other researchers have hypothesized that comprehension of nondecomposable idioms mainly involved left hemispheric activity .
When healthy adults were studied , left temporal rTMS was found to influence the reaction time and accuracy of both idiom comprehension and literal sentence processing .
In particular , it increased processing time and reduced accuracy in understanding .
When rTMS was applied to the left frontal , right frontal and right temporal , there were no effects on idiom comprehension .
Recent research with healthy adults using fMRI also found that , when processing idioms that were not literally interpretable ( i . e . , &amp; quot ; raining cats and dogs &amp; quot ; ) , the Broca ’ s area in the left prefronto-temporal network was activated .
However , when literally interpretable idioms ( i . e . , &amp; quot ; break the ice &amp; quot ; ) were processed , the left medial frontal gyrus ( MFQ ) and superior frontal gyrus ( SFG ) were activated . Prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) is suggested to be important for idiom comprehension .
It may play a role in selecting the appropriate interpretation and suppressing the incorrect ones when an idiomatic expression is encountered .
Research using fMRI indicated that the left temporal cortex , left superior medial frontal gyrus , and left inferior frontal gyrus were activated when idiomatic phrases were presented .
In addition , the right superior and middle temporal gyri , the right temporal pole , and the right inferior frontal gyrus were activated as well .
In contrast , the left inferior parietal lobe and the right supramarginal gyrus were activated when literal sentences were presented . Future research in this field should continue to investigate which brain regions are associated with idiom processing , in order to resolve the ongoing debate on hemispheric specialization in figurative language comprehension .
A recent review suggested that the familiarity affect which brain region is activated during the comprehension of figurative language .
Less familiar expressions are suggested to be processed in the right hemisphere , while more familiar ones are processed predominately in the left hemisphere .
More brain imaging research needs to be conducted to test this hypothesis .
Additionally , future research could use magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) to explore the temporal dynamics of idiom comprehension .
Recent research using MEG has found that , when idioms containing action verbs ( i . e .
&amp; quot ; kick the bucket &amp; quot ; ) were processed , motor regions of the brain were activated .
The anterior fronto-temporal cortex , a region previously found to distinguish between literal and figurative processing , was activated at the same time as well .
This suggests that literal and figurative meanings are processed in parallel to some extent , which gives support to the configurational hypothesis .
More work with MEG should be done to verify these findings .

Ideological diversionismIdeological diversionism : ( &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Diversionismo Ideológico &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ) , term first used by Raúl Castro , then Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and now President of the Council of State of Cuba , delivered as a speech to the Ministry of the Interior ( MININT ) on June 6 of 1972 to celebrate its eleventh anniversary , and published in its entirety in the Cuban magazine Bohemia under the title &amp; quot ; El diversionismo Ideologico , arma sutil que esgrimen los enemigos contra la Revolución &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; 1 &amp; # 93 ; .
&amp; quot ; Ideological Diversionism &amp; quot ; , as used by Castro defined the discursive practice of subjects who appropriated Marxist and communist rhetoric without the &amp; quot ; true revolutionary commitment &amp; quot ; .
The &amp; quot ; diversionist &amp; quot ; thus was a camouflaged subject that spoke as it were from the inside the lines of the Revolutionary cadres , but in reality subscribing the vices and habits of bourgeoisie values .
Ideological Diversionism redefined the political culture of Cuban social landscape during the decades of seventies and eighties , functioning even as a legal and moral category to proscribe , and demoralize dissent and revolutionary citizens that adopted norms that the State sought as deviant from standard social conducts . Castro &amp; apos ; s speech on &amp; quot ; Ideological Diversionism &amp; quot ; sought to come to terms with the so-called peaceful aggressions by imperialists .
The argument behind this thesis was that since imperialism could not defeat socialist countries , their new form of aggression was to destabilize the socialist culture and developmental socialist ideals through the means of propaganda as &amp; quot ; peace means &amp; quot ; of subversion .
This would consequently entail that specially the youth and the intellectual classes were the most prone to ideological manipulation .
As Raul makes clear at one point during his speech : &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; El diversionismo ideologico se realiza , ante todo , mediante la accion sobre la inteligencia , los sentimientos y la mente de las personas .
Hacia esto se orienta todo el sistema de diversion ideologica a escala mundial .
El objetivo de su atencion es en particular la juvetud y espcila la intelectualdia creadora , consideraso amobs por los ideologis imperialista como los recepctivos a su propaganda .
En una de las instrucciones especial a los agendes de la guerra sicologica se les exige , asimismo , centrar su atencion &amp; quot ; en las autoridades locales que influyen en la formacion de la opinion publica &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; 2 &amp; # 93 ; . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Ideological diversionism is done through a mediete action on the intelligence , sentiments , and the mind of people .
The whole system of ideological diversion is oriented towards this goal at planetary scale .
Their particular objective is the youth , and in particular the intellectual creative class , since they are considered as the receptors to their propaganda .
In one of to the special instructions to the agents of the psychological war , they require focussing their work in local authorities that would influence in the shaping of public opinion &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; . After Raul Castro &amp; apos ; s speech in 1972 , many State intellectuals conceptualized and redefined the term of ideological diversionism as a concept to put into use in the &amp; quot ; struggle &amp; quot ; against imperialist heterodox social norms .
In 1974 , one of Cuba most important Marxist cultural critics , Jose Antonio Portuondo , delivered the lecture &amp; quot ; Martí y el Diversionismo Ideologico &amp; quot ; , where he extended Castro &amp; apos ; s theoretical argument by offering a national genealogy of the concept , tracing it to the history of patriot and national independence martyr José Martí &amp; # 91 ; 3 &amp; # 93 ; .
According to Portuondo , it was Jose Marti , a nationalist and exiled Cuban , well before Raul Castro , who first attacked &amp; quot ; ideological diversionism &amp; quot ; as a way to unmask those who fought against independence and in favor of the division within nationalist forces of the nation .
In Portuondo &amp; apos ; s reading , Martí becomes the symbolic figure in which ideological diversionism is neutralized and contained , since there is never a possibility to diverge from what is in the interest of the Nation . In 1979 , a rather different intellectual , the educator Gaspar García Gallo , delivered a lecture entitled &amp; quot ; El diversionismo Ideológico &amp; quot ; in the Psychiatric Hospital of Havana .
Unlike Portuondo , for Gaspar Gallo &amp; quot ; diversionism &amp; quot ; was rooted in the structure of human nature itself and it was to be contested from the biological as well as the psychological view of point .
Intertwining dialectical materialism and pseudoscientific theories , a program that was beginning to take shape in the Lenin School of Havana as a pedagogical project , Gaspar Gallo argued that ideological diversionism , rooted in bourgeois vices and habits , was a product of an ill and corrupted nature &amp; # 91 ; 4 &amp; # 93 ; .
These corruptions included , but were not limited to , homosexuality , western popular culture like The Beatles , laziness , and intellectualism .
Gaspar Gallo offered , in the vein of naturalist of the 19th century , physiological stereotypes in which one could identified &amp; quot ; members &amp; quot ; of this psychological tendencies and deviations in the same way that later on students of the Cuban Communist Youth ( UJC ) will illustrate in the university journal Mella and Alma Mater .
A couple of years before the lecture given by Gaspar Gallo , &amp; quot ; ideological diversionism &amp; quot ; was integrated into the official legal document Tesis y Resoluciones del Primer Congreso del Partido Comunista de Cuba ( 1976 ) , and defined in these terms : &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; El diversionismo es una labor encubierta , solapada , que consiste en criticar al marxismo desde posiciones supuesta mente marxistas , con un falso ropaje revolucionario , progresista , o a lo sumo aparentando imparcialidad u objetividad ; que trata de introducir en las filas revolucionarias las ideas contrarias al socialismo , presentándolas como socialistas o como favorables al socialismo , o como ideas nuevas « superiores » a las del socialismo , que lo mejoran o perfeccionan .
Toda labor ideológica persigue objetivos políticos .
El diversionismo imperialista se dirige a minar , desde adentro , las fuerzas del socialismo ; relajar sus bases ideológicas , introducir concepciones burguesas , mellar los principios básicos de la teoría científica del socialismo ; entorpecer o frustrar los planes de desarrollo , desvirtuar los objetivos principales en la economía y en la formación comunista de las masas ; dividir y sembrar la desconfianza en el seno de las fuerzas populares ; tratar de desacreditar a los dirigentes ; crear , en definitiva , un ambiente de relajamiento de los principios socialistas y de inconformidad en las masas , que sea caldo de cultivo para un retroceso ideológico , político y social que conduzca gradualmente a la derrota del socialismo &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; 5 &amp; # 93 ; In the Cuban intellectual discussion , the concept of ideological diversionism is sometimes referred as having direct influence from the era of Stalinism &amp; # 91 ; 6 &amp; # 93 ; .
Although in the Stalinist historiography the direct concept is never articulated as such , one could point for a possible intellectual origin the 1929 text &amp; quot ; On Right Deviation in our Party &amp; quot ; , where Stalin heavily critiques Bukharin , the kulak culture , and &amp; quot ; social democracy &amp; quot ; tendencies within the Soviet Communist Party .
Deviations , according to Stalin , unlike Mao , must never be present in the Party , since it a structure of division in the vanguard of the People &amp; # 91 ; 7 &amp; # 93 ; .
Stalin &amp; apos ; s deviation differs from the &amp; quot ; diversionist &amp; quot ; position to the extent that it never seeks to establish a &amp; quot ; foreign &amp; quot ; influence or a linguistic appropriation of Marxist categories as an aesthetic of concealment .
Stalin &amp; apos ; s critique of deviation centered on the nature and necessity to keep the nature of class struggle as a driven principle of Soviet Society .
In the Cuban case , diversionism besides being about the formation of a class unity , as it was about exclusion of a particular social subject . Another notable work about diversionism from the Soviet Union is Prosčety ideologičeskix diversantov ( The Miscalculations of Ideological Saboteurs ) by V .
I .
Strepetov , written in 1976 , and translated into Spanish in 1980 by Editorial Progreso .
This means that this work was read and perhaps studied in Latin America and Cuba &amp; # 91 ; 8 &amp; # 93 ; , and that it was most probably influenced by Raul Castro &amp; apos ; s speech of 1972 .
Strepetov as Raul Castro , sees the danger of diversionism as a flow of ideas coming from the West and that seek to destroy the anti-bourgeois principles of the Soviet Union .
Diversionism is seeing as an activity and even &amp; quot ; sabotage &amp; quot ; to undermine the different relations and core principles of the soviet people , including labor , discipline , and loyalty .
Confronting the discourses of Western Marxism and the crisis of theoretical paradigms that explicate the new capitalist post-industrial constellation , Strepetov suggests that ideological diversionism fosters a new tool for imperial and United States domination , not through violence and war , but through culture and rhetoric .
Precisely the Russian term diversantov means the flow of ideas coming &amp; quot ; from outside &amp; quot ; , and not merely a deviation from the norm . Ideological Diversionism was not only a political or juridical term , since it also functioned , even before Raul Castro &amp; apos ; s speech in 1972 , to police conducts and norms of everyday citizens and the production of culture , whether it was fashion , literature , or cinema .
Most of the cultural production censored since the mid-1960s in Cuba - novels like Adire y el tiempo roto ( 1967 ) by Manuel Granados , and poetry books like Fuera del Juego ( 1968 ) by Heberto Padilla - were judged and accused from the paradigm of diversionism .
It was in the university circles and groups were ideological diversionism was intensified as a hate speech against plural thinking of an array of social actors .
As Mella or Alma Mater , two of the official publications of the University of Havana makes clear , the diversionist were from the &amp; quot ; intellectualized student &amp; quot ; , who wore sandals , carry books by Jean-Paul Sartre and had homosexual conducts , to the bureaucrat , those interested in fashion or even those who would mimic The Beatles &amp; apos ; haircuts ( see figure 1 . ) .
These deviant cultural incarnations were not only not possible in the public sphere , but also had to be eliminated from all possible political and social activity to prevent contamination .
In everyday life speech , &amp; quot ; diversionists &amp; quot ; were labeled as &amp; quot ; débiles &amp; quot ; ( weaks ) , &amp; quot ; raros &amp; quot ; ( weirdos ) , and &amp; quot ; gusanos &amp; quot ; ( worms ) , terms that picked out the heterogeneity of social groups that contested the Revolution from below starting in the first decade of the Revolution , as the personal case of Anna Veltfort , an art history student at University of Havana bears witness to it &amp; # 91 ; 9 &amp; # 93 ; ( see Figure 1 . ) . Figure 1 .
&amp; quot ; A los gusanos hay que hervirlos &amp; quot ; .
Revista Mella , June 1965 .
&amp; quot ; Los Gusanos &amp; quot ; . Ideological diversionism was a cultural logic that led way for orthodox Marxist to foster a notions of ideological purity and normalization in Marxist culture .
Hence , a great part of Western Marxism , from Jean-Paul Sartre &amp; apos ; s humanist existentialism and the Frankfurt School , to Antonio Gramsci and the debates of structuralism and post-structuralism in France , were banned from intellectual and academic circles within and out the University of Havana &amp; # 91 ; 10 &amp; # 93 ; .
In the need to suppress &amp; quot ; cultural &amp; quot ; horizons of Marxist thinking , in favor of a &amp; quot ; scientific mode &amp; quot ; of dialectical materialism , ideological diversionism was by itself a cultural invention to suspend all possible cultural articulation of Marxism as such .
In the Cuba of the 1970s , as one could see from journals such as Educación or Cuba Socialista , Marxism was understood as a hard science that little or nothing had to do with everyday hybridity of cultural forms and habits &amp; # 91 ; 11 &amp; # 93 ; .
The sovietization of the political system of Cuba , starting in 1971 with the National Congress of Education and Culture and with the first Constitution of Communist Party in 1976 , further catalyzed the closure of the many different and plural positions within socialism , Marxism , social democracy , and syndicalism during the first five years after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution .
Ideological Diversionism was the operation by which power articulated a totalizing enframing of a national socialist culture . Figure 2 .
&amp; quot ; El intelectualizado &amp; quot ; as a &amp; quot ; ideological diversionist &amp; quot ; subject .
Revista Mella , 1964 . El Intelectualizado . From an analysis of the politics of memory , many Cubans still remember the usages of ideological diversionism in everyday life , such as in schools , the street , the police , and the televised speeches of Fidel Castro .
When asked to a 58-year-old Cuban from Miami accused and imprisoned for ideological diversionism , he remembered : &amp; quot ; Yo claro que recuerdo el uso del término &amp; quot ; diversionismo ideológico &amp; quot ; , era una palabra que se utilizaba para tildar a la gente que le gustaban las cosas del extranjero ; ya sean zapatos caros , la música rock , o que incluso recibía cartas de sus familiares exiliados .
Diversionista también era todo aquel que no simpatizaba y ni creía en los valores de la Revolución , y por eso sentía fuera de aquella sociedad .
An otros le hacían actos de repudio , como tirarle huevos &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; 12 &amp; # 93 ; .
Not only are testimonies alive in the living memory of Cubans within and outside the island , but in recent cultural production the term has also repapered .
For instance , the punk band &amp; quot ; Porno Para Ricardo &amp; quot ; , has included the term in many of their lyrics , and the frontman of the band , Gorki Águila , sometimes comes out in the stage wearing a T-shirt that reads &amp; quot ; Viva el diversionismo Ideologico ! &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; Hurray for ideological diversionism ! &amp; quot ; ) , a public provocation that today has lost all its radical intentions in contemporary Cuba .
In New York , the Cuban poet Alexis Romay has recently published a book , Diversionismo Ideologico , where he writes about the political and social realities of Cubans of both shores through décima poems &amp; # 91 ; 13 &amp; # 93 ; .
While , the young Cuban visual artist Hamlet Lavastida has worked through many of his pieces , the &amp; quot ; ideological diversionism speech &amp; quot ; and many of the political texts that were instrumental to the making of a new revolutionary subject after the Cuban Revolution . 1 .

Temperance WickTemperance Wick ( October 30 , 1758 - April 26 , 1822 ) , also known as Tempe Wick and Tempe , was an American Revolutionary War heroine and the subject of many early American legends .
She is traditionally regarded as an example of female patriotism in the early Republic , though many scholars and historians dispute the historical accuracy of the stories and traditions surrounding her life . Tempe Wick was born at Jockey Hollow in Morris County , New Jersey , the youngest of Henry Wick &amp; apos ; s five children .
She was likely named after her paternal grandmother Temperance Barnes .
The Wick family were one of the first and oldest families in America .
Her father , Henry Wick , was a grandson of the Pilgrim Father John Wick , and was the wealthiest and largest landowner in that part of New Jersey .
Very little is known of her early life , but at the age of 21 she and her brother Henry Wick , Jr .
were the last of the Wick children living at home with their elderly parents . Henry Wick was commander of the Morris County Cavalry , which was responsible for protecting the New Jersey government and legislature . The winter of 1780-1781 was known as the Hard Winter because of its unprecedented severity .
The Continental Army , consisting of more than 10,000 soldiers , made camp on the Wick family &amp; apos ; s 1400 acre estate , Jockey Hollow , while General Arthur St .
Clair and his staff rented quarters in the Wick House . During the winter at Jockey Hollow , supplies for the large force put great burdens on the community .
The troops were poorly clothed and fed , and many went barefoot in the snow .
An estimated 100 soldiers died in the brigade hospital that winter and were buried in the field north of the Wick House . Despite many requests and pleas to the Second Continental Congress , the soldiers wintering in Jockey Hollow had not been paid for most of the year and over a thousand soldiers had deserted .
The issues came to a head in late December , when a group of Pennsylvania soldiers organized a mutiny .
They planned to march to Philadelphia to demand their pay directly from Congress .
The mutineers spent several days foraging through the countryside and stealing any horses and food they found . On December 21 , 1780 , Henry Wick died , leaving Tempe alone to care for her sick mother Mary and her mentally ill brother Henry .
When her mother &amp; apos ; s condition worsened , Tempe saddled her horse and rode for the home of Doctor William Leddell , who lived about a mile away .
The doctor was not present , so Tempe left a message at the Leddell residence and returned home . Along the way , she was accosted by three mutineers .
One grabbed the bridle of her horse , demanding that she give them her mount .
Tempe agreed , but when the soldier released the bridle to help her down from the saddle , she whipped her horse and raced for home .
She arrived safely , but she feared the mutineers would follow her home and take the horse by force . According to one version of the story , Tempe led the horse into the house and hid it in a guest bedroom .
She closed the shutter over the window and put a feather bed under it to muffle the sound of its hooves .
The soldiers arrived soon after and searched the outbuildings , barn , and woods around the house , but left empty-handed .
Tempe supposedly kept the horse hidden in the bedroom until New Year &amp; apos ; s Day , when the mutineers marched south to Princeton , New Jersey . In another version of the story , Tempe hid her horse in the kitchen .
Claims are frequently made that a faint imprint of a horse &amp; apos ; s shoe can be seen in one of the bedrooms in the Wick House .
The Wick House at Jockey Hollow still stands , and is now a part of the Morristown National Historical Park .
Visitors are allowed to see the bedroom where Tempe is said to have hidden her horse . After her mother Mary died on July 7 , 1787 , Tempe inherited Jockey Hollow , and married Dr .
William Tuttle at the relatively late age of 30 .
Together they had five children . Scholars dispute the historical accuracy of her life and the traditions surrounding her role in the Pennsylvania Line Mutiny , but she and her parents are frequently mentioned in extant historical documents from the period , including letters , journals , and receipts . Tempe Wick is the main character in a short story written by the American story-teller Frank R .
Stockton .
His version emphasizes the patriotic virtues of American girls , using Tempe Wick as an example .
However , most scholars agree that Stockton used very few sources when writing the story , and like most later writers and story-tellers who wrote about Tempe Wick , added many details of his own to the legend . Stockton &amp; apos ; s story is filled with exhortations to patriotism and courage : &amp; quot ; When &amp; # 91 ; Tempe &amp; # 93 ; first began to canter over these hills and dales , it had been in times of peace , when there was nothing in this quiet country of which any one might be afraid ; and now , although these were days of war , she felt no fear .
There were soldiers not far away , but these she looked upon as her friends and protectors ; for Washington and his army had encamped in that region to defend the country against the approach of the enemy . &amp; quot ; Ann Rinaldi &amp; apos ; s historical fiction novel &amp; quot ; A Ride Into Morning &amp; quot ; centers on Tempe Wick and her family and is told from the perspective of Tempe &amp; apos ; s cousin Mary Cooper . Howard Fast &amp; apos ; s historical novel &amp; quot ; The Proud and the Free &amp; quot ; ( 1950 ) , tells the story of the Pennsylvania Line Mutiny from the enlisted man &amp; apos ; s perspective . Patricia Lee Gauch &amp; apos ; s version of the story , &amp; quot ; This Time , Tempe Wick ? &amp; quot ; , is a popular children &amp; apos ; s book .

Amanda Petrusich in her 2012 article on Young for &amp; quot ; The New York Times &amp; quot ; states that he &amp; quot ; favors raw light and has a penchant for shooting into it , but said he ultimately focuses on getting out of the way . &amp; quot ; In a 2013 article from &amp; quot ; The Washington Post &amp; quot ; about cinematographers who were trained at Howard University , Hans Charles , a frequent camera assistant for Young said that he has developed a versatile but also consistently poetic , oblique visual style . In a 2017 article from the Courier Journal , Young is quoted as acknowledging older black cinematographers such as Ernest Dickerson ( &amp; quot ; Malcolm X &amp; quot ; ) , ( &amp; quot ; Daughters of the Dust &amp; quot ; ) and Malik Sayeed ( &amp; quot ; Clockers &amp; quot ; ) as artists who lay a foundation for black cinematographers like himself .
He told the Courier Journal that he was &amp; quot ; trying to find that balance between making sure I am present but also being that voice in the wilderness that says &amp; apos ; there has been great work by African-American cinematographers and it &amp; apos ; s a shame those people who came before me and who have been my teachers were not nominated for awards . &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; He also cited his childhood memory as a key source of inspiration : &amp; quot ; Early on , when I came upon a technical difficulty ( making a film ) , I would think back to my memories of growing up in Louisville and what the lighting was like in those moments .
I still do that to this day .
I think about my grandmother &amp; apos ; s house on Greenwood Avenue and scenes during her wonderful parties .
Or I envision the light in my Aunt Marie &amp; apos ; s kitchen .
When I am stuck on a technical issue making a film , I access those memories and I know I am doing the right thing . &amp; quot ; Young has spoken about his affinity for nonlinear storytelling and switching between overhead and handheld camera shots .

William H .
AbendrothWilliam H .
Abendroth ( December 24 , 1895 – September 3 , 1970 ) was a United States Army Major General who served as Director of the Army National Guard and Commander of the District of Columbia National Guard . William Henry Abendroth , Jr . , nicknamed Harry , was the son of a career soldier who served in the American Indian Wars and the Spanish – American War before retiring as a First Sergeant and becoming an instructor in military studies at the University of Idaho .
The younger Abendroth was born in Fort Meade , South Dakota , on December 24 , 1895 .
He enlisted in the Idaho National Guard in 1913 , and served as a member of Company H , 2nd Idaho Infantry Regiment on the Mexican border during the Pancho Villa Expedition . Abendroth served with the Army in France during World War I , first in an Infantry company , and later with an Engineer unit .
He achieved the rank of First Sergeant by the end of the war , and was discharged in 1919 . In 1927 , Abendroth rejoined the Idaho National Guard and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant of Cavalry .
He quickly advanced through command and staff positions of increasing rank and responsibility , including serving as military aide to the Governor of Idaho with the rank of Captain .
He commanded the 116th Cavalry Regiment as a Colonel in the years immediately preceding the Second World War . Abendroth also pursued a civilian career in state government , including appointments as a Purchasing Agent and Claims Examiner in the Purchasing Department , Budget Director for the State of Idaho , Disbursing Officer in the Highway Department , and Rural Electrification Manager for Idaho Power . In 1938 , Abendroth was tried on embezzlement charges , accused of taking money while working as a Purchasing Agent for the state .
He was charged with three counts , one each for $ 50 , $ 250 and $ 50 .
He received a directed verdict of acquittal from the judge after the primary witness against Abendroth impeached himself under direct examination by the prosecutor . Abendroth was called to active duty for World War II .
Assigned to the Headquarters of the IX Corps , he was posted as Commandant of the Officer Candidate School , Provost Marshal for the corps area and Commandant of the corps headquarters , serving in Hawaii , the Philippines , and Japan . Upon returning to the United States Abendroth became a student at the United States Army Command and General Staff College , from which he graduated in 1946 . In April , 1946 he was appointed Adjutant General of the Idaho Military Department and federal Director of Selective Service for Idaho , receiving promotion to Brigadier General .
He served until December , when a change in the governorship led to his resignation , enabling the new governor to appoint his own candidate . As a Colonel , Abendroth was then called to active duty , serving in the National Guard and Reserve Policy Office for the Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1947 to 1949 . In 1949 , Abendroth was appointed Commander of the District of Columbia National Guard .
He received promotion to Major General and served until retiring in 1967 , when he was succeeded by Charles L .
Southward .
From 1951 to 1955 , Abendroth also served as Chief of the Army Division ( now Director of the Army National Guard ) at the National Guard Bureau . In retirement , Abendroth resided in Falls Church , Virginia .
He died at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington , D . C .
on September 3 , 1970 .
Abendroth is buried at Arlington National Cemetery , Section 5 , Lot 21 . Abendroth received the Army Distinguished Service Medal at his retirement .
He was also a recipient of the Legion of Merit for his service in World War II . The Abendroth Trophy is awarded each year to the best Army or Air Force unit of the District of Columbia National Guard during Annual Training .

Alfred BeckerAlfred Becker ( 20 August 1899 – unknown ) was a German engineer and artillery officer who served during the First and Second World Wars .
He was born and raised in Krefeld .
A mechanical engineer by training , he is best known as being the primary person responsible for taking obsolete captured British and French vehicles and refurbishing and redesigning them into useful instruments for the German army .
With his engineering and organizational skills , he converted the Hotchkiss plant on the outskirts of Paris into a vehicle modification and fabrication center .
He used the vehicles to mobilize German guns , rocket launchers and mortars .
Working with Alkett , steel shielding was shipped from Germany to armour the vehicles .
The men from his artillery command did the metal work and conversion on 1,800 recovered vehicles .
During the winter of 1943-44 Becker &amp; apos ; s work focused on equipping the 21st Panzer Division .
He used the tracked carriages of French light tanks to mobilize the 7 . 5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank gun and the 10 . 5 cm leFH 18 howitzer .
Becker had the tank turrets removed , mounted the guns upon the chassis and placed steel plates around the crew compartment to give them some measure of protection .
The vehicles were formed into a fire support unit , the Sturmgeschütz Abteilung 200 .
Becker was made the commander of this motorized assault gun battalion , and led the unit during the battles of Normandy .
Some of Becker &amp; apos ; s unit escaped the encirclement at Falaise and they retreated across France and into Belgium .
Becker was captured in Alsace on the French / German border in December 1944 . During the First World War Becker served as an artillery officer .
For his service he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd and 1st class . Following the armistice Becker attended university and earned a doctorate in mechanical engineering .
He worked as a designer in the textile industry and was co-owner of the company Volkmann &amp; amp ; Company in Krefeld .
He also formed a small manufacturing firm , Alfred Becker AG of Bielefeld . On 28 August 1939 Becker was called up to serve in the 227th Infantry Division &amp; quot ; Rhine-Westphalian &amp; quot ; , drawn from the Krefeld area during the 3rd wave mobilization .
Becker was made an officer in the division ’ s 15th Artillery Regiment , under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Edgar Feuchtinger .
He was rapidly promoted to the rank of captain and made Batterychief of Battery # 12 .
When Germany invaded Poland the 227th Infantry Division was on the western frontier with the 5th Army performing border protection in the Eifel region , near Belgium . In December 1939 Becker &amp; apos ; s division was re-assigned and became a part of Army Group B under command of &amp; quot ; Generalfeldmarshall &amp; quot ; Fedor von Bock , in preparation for &amp; quot ; Fall Gelb &amp; quot ; .
Becker &amp; apos ; s artillery regiment was re-numbered the 227th Artillery Regiment .
On 10 May 1940 the division engaged in the offensive into the Netherlands and Belgium as part of the 18th Army .
Becker &amp; apos ; s artillery battery provided fire support as the division advanced its way through Enschede and Deventer .
All the guns in Becker &amp; apos ; s artillery regiment were pulled by horse drawn limbers and caissons , the standard practice for infantry divisions of the Heer .
Becker &amp; apos ; s division reached the Grebbe line , where it was held up for three days .
An attack on 13 May supported by artillery fire was unable to break the line .
That night the Dutch forces withdrew under the cover of night .
When the 227th went in to resume the attack the next morning they found the positions abandoned .
Becker and the 227th crossed the Leie and continued the advance , taking Amersfoort just before the Dutch capitulation on 19 May 1940 . While his unit was at Amersfoort Becker came across the abandoned motor transport of a well-equipped Dutch artillery regiment .
There were a large number of heavy vehicles which he believed he could use .
To pull the artillery pieces , a battery such as Becker ’ s depended on the use of 126 horses .
To replace them , Becker chose the large wheeled Brossel TAL artillery lorrie .
Becker used other captured Belgian trucks to motorize the field piece transport of his division &amp; apos ; s reconnaissance battalion , thereby increasing this unit &amp; apos ; s mobility as well .
The limbers were left behind , and later transported to France by rail .
Motorizing the transport for his battery made it far more mobile , allowing his battery to keep up with the advance of the division &amp; apos ; s lead elements . Following the German victory in France in July 1940 the 227th Division was assigned occupation , security and coastal defense duties along the Normandy coast near Le Havre .
There Becker came across many discarded British light tanks and light personnel carriers .
After achieving improved mobility by use of motor tractors , Becker considered the benefits that could be derived from mounting the guns directly onto the abandoned motorized carriages .
Becker selected the light but reliable English built Vickers Mk . VI armored vehicle for the under-carriage , more than 300 of which had been left behind .
The design of this British light tank offered them suitable for use as artillery self-propelled guns , since the motor , transmission , steering assembly and drive wheels were all grouped together in the front of the chassis , leaving the rear of the vehicle available for the gun and crew .
The superstructure and turret of the tanks were removed , replaced by the installation of an artillery gun .
The vehicle used a four man crew . Though the men in his battery had occupation duties , like Becker they were from Krefeld , an area with a strong manufacturing heritage .
Many of his men had worked in manufacturing jobs and were skilled metal workers .
Recruiting the men of his battery and working by shift day and night , he set about his project .
Becker had the machine gun turret removed and mounted a 10 . 5 cm leFH 16 howitzer upon the chassis .
The light weight chassis of the Vickers Mk VI did not provide much mass to act as a counter to the heavy gun .
To stabilize the howitzer when firing , Becker arrived at the solution to direct the recoil forces to the ground through a lowered rear spur .
Becker &amp; apos ; s personal relationship with Deutsche Edelstahlwerke Gmbh in Krefeld secured the 20 mm thick armor casements used to protect the crew compartment .
In six months his unit succeeded in creating a complete battery , mobilizing twelve of the battalion &amp; apos ; s 10 . 5 cm leFH 16 howitzers and six of the larger 15 cm sFH 13 guns .
He also built twelve munitions carrying versions of the Vickers Mk . VI , several munitions carrying versions of the Bren gun carrier and four armoured command tank versions of the Vickers Mk .
VI .
With mobilizing his guns Becker had built the first battery of self-propelled artillery .
This marked the start of a development that led to the creation of a separate tank artillery , and was a significant contribution to the further development of the panzer division .
The battery ’ s initial test firing was done at the range at Harfleur near Le Havre , France .
The complete battery was tested at the training grounds at Beverloo , Belgium .
For his work on mobilizing the artillery pieces Becker was awarded the German Cross in Gold . In June 1941 the German army invaded Soviet Russia .
In September Becker and his 227th Infantry Division were transferred to Army Group North .
His was the only infantry division on the Eastern Front to have a motorized artillery battery .
By December the division had become involved in fighting near Leningrad .
Becker ’ s homemade self-propelled guns of the 12th Battery proved successful .
Due to its mobility , Becker ’ s unit was used as a fire brigade to reinforce areas that were in distress . Over the course of the campaign it became apparent that German infantry formations had great difficulty defending against Soviet tank attacks .
The standard anti-tanks they had , the 3 . 7 cm Pak 36 , did not have the penetrative power to stop the larger Soviet tanks , and the high mobility of the Soviet tank forces made it difficult to get the higher caliber weapons to where they were needed .
Alkett had earlier made a conversion vehicle when they mounted a 4,7 cm Pak ( t ) anti-tank gun on a French Renault R35 chassis , and from May to October in 1941 had produced 174 of these &amp; quot ; Panzerjäger Geschützwagen &amp; quot ; .
They also used the Renault R35 to produce the Führungsfahrzeuge ausgeliefert , which simply was the R35 with the turret removed to make a tractor .
They produced 26 units of the tractor version . Becker was ordered back from the east front to the Alkett company to consider a means by which they might mobilize the 7 . 5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank gun .
Becker and the Alkett consultants worked closely together on the solution of the overall concept .
Among the vehicles they considered for the project was the French built Lorraine tractor , about 360 of which had fallen into German hands .
Due to its reliability , the Lorraine was well suited to the maneuver warfare battles the Germans favoured .
The captured tractors had been first used by the Germans to pull artillery pieces , and were renamed the &amp; quot ; Lorraine Schlepper ( f ) &amp; quot ; .
These tractors provided the German army with a fully tracked vehicle to carry supplies or tow artillery pieces .
Such a vehicle was badly needed due to the extremely poor road conditions in Russia , all the more so as the Germans had not yet produced such a vehicle themselves .
The Lorraine chassis looked to be a good choice , as unlike German tank designs , the engine in the Lorraine was housed in the front of the vehicle , leaving the rear portion open for the housing and operation of the gun . On 25 May 1942 a presentation of a self-propelled Lorraine tractor was made .
The presentation was successful and the decision made that all 160 Lorraine tractors still available should be converted into self-propelled guns , with 60 of them mounting the 7 . 5 cm Pak 40 .
On 4 June 1942 , a final decision was made by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel on the 78 Lorraine tractors repaired at the HKP Bielitz , and another 24 tractors were released for mounting of the 7 . 5 cm Pak 40 .
This became the Marder I tank hunter that was used initially to provide a mobile anti-tank defense for infantry divisions in the east . In August 1942 , one of the Becker-designed vehicles was withdrawn at the request of the OKH and shipped to Berlin .
On 2 September 1942 it was presented in the garden of the Reich Chancellery by Becker and one of his crews to Adolf Hitler and officers in charge of the Army Ordnance Office .
The demonstration was a success .
The German Army High Command , the Oberkommando des Heeres chose the Altmärkische catenary Gmbh ( Alkett ) in Berlin-Spandau to create more of these self-propelled artillery pieces .
The Army Ordnance Department had made use of the Alkett plant in Berlin for this kind of work previously due to their manufacturing flexibility and workers skilled in solving problems in tank construction .
Becker was transferred to this company and given access to their experience and expertise . Becker &amp; apos ; s assignment at Alkett was to create mobile field pieces for Rommel in North Africa .
The battles of the open desert placed a premium on mobility .
Becker chose the French Lorraine Schlepper ammunition carriers as the platform for a self-propelled 150 mm sFH 18 heavy field howitzer .
The Lorraine chassis , with its forward engine design , lent itself to this conversion .
This vehicle , known then as &amp; quot ; 15 cm sFH13 / 1 ( Sf ) auf Geschützwagen Lorraine Schlepper ( f ) &amp; quot ; , met with great approval from the OKH .
The vehicles were shipped to North Africa for use with the Afrika Korps .
After Becker had completed this project he was ordered by Hitler to return to France , take an inventory of all remaining British and French armored vehicles , and determine if they were suitable for German requirements .
He was then to collect them and convert them to practical German use .
The order required Becker to create enough usable equipment to form &amp; quot ; at least &amp; quot ; two panzer divisions . Under the authority of the Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production Baukommando Becker was created .
The command made use of three factories in France , the Matford Factory , the Talbot Factory and the Hotchkiss Factory , all near Paris .
A large quantity of damaged Allied military vehicles were available in France , but their utility in 1942 was of serious doubt .
Those French armoured vehicles undamaged following the campaign of 1940 had been assigned to occupation forces , training units and anti-partisan forces .
These early French built tanks , designed with small gun turrets and mounting small caliber main guns , were of little value in 1942 for combat against such weapons as the Russian T-34 .
The German army did not assign them to front line troops .
Though lightly armoured and under-gunned by the combat standards of the day , these were fully tracked vehicles , a feature which Becker believed could be usefully exploited .
In addition to the wrecked and captured French and British tanks , Becker also had access to a large number of soft-skinned half-tracked vehicles such as the SOMUA MCG and the smaller Unic P107 .
These vehicles were in various states of disrepair , mostly located in northern France but present throughout the whole country , often left out and rusting in the elements .
The task before Becker was enormous .
Becker set up his headquarters at Maisons-Laffitte on the northern outskirts of Paris .
He organized his men into special parties to commence a thorough search of the occupied territory in the west for wrecked vehicles previously thought useful only for scrapping .
Vehicles were recovered from streams , rivers and fields and collected at the repair facilities near Paris .
The vehicles collected were divided into three main groups : those requiring minor repairs and refits , those requiring major repair and refits , and those that were beyond use and were to be used as a source for spare parts .
Becker was assigned an engineering staff , who set about their work modifying what was available . The wrecks were disassembled , cleaned off and changes to the design were worked out .
Then an assembly line was set up at one of the factories to do a production line on the type and a run of the modified vehicles was created .
The bodies of the overhauled vehicles were given purpose appropriate superstructures .
Becker &amp; apos ; s basic idea for the conversion was straightforward in principle : he would build a prototype of the replacement superstructure by framing it out of wood panels and sending these to Alkett .
Alkett would then produce a run of replacement superstructures made out of steel .
These were then shipped back to France where Becker had completed the engineering plans for the conversion .
The conversion process was streamlined , the Hotchkiss assembly line was brought up and a run of assembly was completed .
The vehicles where refitted and repaired by importance , all of one type at a time .
Remaining parts were stored away for spares .
A special effort was made to guarantee that a spare parts supply would be available .
For important parts subject to special wear a 10 % supply of parts was created , while for parts subject to general wear a 30 % supply of parts was stored up .
Leftover materials were shipped back to the steelworks . The most innovative aspect of the work was the battle value assessment of the vehicles , that is determining how to make the most effective use of each vehicle type in relation to the current battlefield conditions .
From 1942 through 1943 Becker salvaged all the usable tank wreckage that could be found in France .
Some 1,800 armoured fighting vehicles were created at his Baukommando Becker ( Construction Unit Becker ) , which produced a variety of innovative designs .
From July to August , 1942 , Becker converted 170 armoured vehicles into the Marder I , a 75 mm self-propelled anti-tank gun .
A further 106 chassis were converted into self-propelled artillery pieces , with 94 conversions to carry the 150 mm howitzer , and 12 more to carry the 105 mm .
In addition , he produced 30 artillery observation vehicles using this same chassis . The soldiers of the 12th artillery battery that Becker had left in Russia were in harsh conditions .
Battling the cold and involved in heavy fighting , over time their vehicles were slowly lost , either due to mines or from direct fire from Soviet tanks .
When their guns were lost the men that survived were put to use as infantrymen .
The 227th Infantry Division was involved in heavy fighting near Leningrad defending against the Red Army &amp; apos ; s main offensive at Sinyavino Heights and the south shore of Lake Ladoga .
From August through September 1942 the division suffered many casualties in what was called the Battle of Lake Ladoga .
Concerned for the men in his old unit and needing their skills for the work he was doing , Becker requested the transfer of the men from the 12th Battery back to his command in Paris .
Strict rules prohibited such transfers of operational troops from Russia to France .
Contacting his old divisional commander , Becker devised a work around .
The commander of the 227th Infantry Division agreed to make use of leave requirements and send home ten of Becker ’ s Krefelders a week for leave .
When their leave was up the men traveled to France and reported for duty at the Baustab Becker .
By Christmas 1942 almost all of Becker ’ s men had reached Paris .
In exchange in this unusual arrangement , Becker provided the commander of the 227th Infantry Division with 20 of his armoured vehicles .
In 1943 Becker began conversion of the Hotchkiss H35 and H39 light tanks , which had carried a 37 mm gun .
He refit them to mount a 7 . 5 cm PaK40 anti-tank gun or 10 . 5 cm leFH16 howitzer assault gun .
These were the units that were used extensively in the equipping of the reformed 21st Panzer Division , and can be seen in images of Rommel reviewing the unit in May 1944 .
Another major project undertaken at this time was the work he did on the soft-skinned French half-tracked vehicles , the SOMUA MCG and the Unic P107 .
Both these vehicles were armoured to make them more survivable in the battle environment .
In addition he used the SOMUA MCG as a platform for a number of weapons , including the Nebelwerfer , the Vielfachwerfer , and the Reihenwerfer , his own creation of a battery of up to twenty 81 mm mortars .
The smaller Unic P107 light halftrack was reinforced with armour and used primarily as a troop carrier in substitute for the Sd . Kfz .
251 . Early in 1943 the Baustab Becker was visited by Albert Speer , and the Matford factory was reviewed by Speer , with General Feuchtinger and Major Becker .
Film taken at this time document the visit and show many of the conversions completed at the site .
A notation in the film states the film was taken so that Hitler could see what was being done there .
Over the course of 1943 a number of other high ranking German officers visited Baukommando Becker , including Erich Marcks , Gerd von Rundstedt , and Heinz Guderian . On March 15 , 1943 Major Becker &amp; apos ; s unit , the gepanzerte Artillerie Brigade of Schnelle Brigade West , participated in a memorial to the men of 15 Batterie Artillerie Regiment 227 killed in action during the Leningrad siege of 1941-42 .
Becker and his officers laid wreaths in their memory . Edgar Feuchtinger was appointed commander of a forming unit called Schnelle Division West ( Fast Division West ) .
The &amp; quot ; schnelle &amp; quot ; divisions were conceived as highly mobile units that would be stationed in France to serve as a rapid response force .
Being highly motorized , they were to be able to cover a great deal of ground to reach any point of invasion .
The &amp; quot ; Schnelle &amp; quot ; divisions were to be more completely motorized than a panzer division . By 1943 German industry was hard pressed to produce the arms and vehicles needed to replace losses on the East front .
Vehicles were in short supply , and as OKH was well aware of the production out of Baustab Becker , they made the unusual requirement that the reforming 21st Panzer Division not make a request for any equipment or vehicles .
The OKH instruction issued 27 June 1943 , read : &amp; quot ; Equipment and vehicles are not allotted .
It is expressly forbidden to requisition material for 21 .
Panzer Division in any way .
The necessary equipment and motor vehicles are to be secured exclusively from captured French vehicles or from OB West . &amp; quot ; Feuchtinger turned to Becker , whom he had known from early in the war , to generate the equipment needed to motorize his unit .
The brigade was equipped with captured French built tanks , which were under-gunned by 1943 standards .
Becker produced a great many vehicles for Schnelle Brigade West , soon to be expanded into a division .
In the summer of 1943 Feuchtinger gave Becker command of the Sturmgeschütz Abteilung 200 , a part of his rebuilding 21st Panzer Division .
Sturmgeschütz Abteilung 200 formed from the Panzer Artillerie Abteilung West with four batteries .
Becker &amp; apos ; s unit was equipped with his conversion assault guns .
In addition , he had two batteries of 88 mm guns under his command .
Becker produced a great number of half-tracks making use of captured and refurbished French vehicles .
These he armoured .
He produced enough of these to motorize one of the two infantry regiments of the 21st Division .
To provide the division with mobile firepower he also mounted rockets , mortars and even 7 . 5cm PaK 40 guns on these armoured half-tracks .
The majority of this work was completed at Baustocommando Becker .
In early 1944 , Becker &amp; apos ; s combat unit , Sturmgeschütz Abteilung 200 , moved to its new deployment area near Mauron in Brittany .
The unit &amp; apos ; s headquarters were in the town of Voves , south-east of Chartres .
Later that spring Erwin Rommel , the new commander of Heeres Group B moved the 21st Panzer Division up towards the Normandy coast near Caen .
Rommel visited the Normandy defenses twice in May , and reviewed the various mobile gun platforms that had been created .
By this time Becker had built his assault gun battalion up to five batteries , but the crews were still green in the use of the vehicles .
By combining the 7 . 5 cm anti-tank guns with the 10 . 5 cm howitzers , he had formed a new type of fire support unit .
He recorded in his archive his assessment of the unit ’ s effectiveness in Normandy : In the Battle for Normandy the 21st Panzer Division was the only mechanized unit near the area of the invasion , and was the only one with an opportunity to realize Rommel &amp; apos ; s intentions and meet the invaders at the beach .
A number of problems in command and control resulted in the division failing to go into action on the night of June 5 / 6 when the area was inundated with British paratroopers from the 6th Airborne Division .
Becker &amp; apos ; s assault gun unit did not take part in the first day &amp; apos ; s fighting , but by 9 June three of his batteries were providing fire support for the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment .
Both the 105 mm howitzers and the 75 mm Pak 40s were effective anti-tank weapons .
Allied troops commonly mistook the 7 . 5 cm PaK40 / 1 auf Geschuetzwagen Lorraine Schleppers to be armed with 88s . Following six weeks of combat with limited gains , General Bernard Montgomery ordered Operation Goodwood to try and break the Normandy stalemate .
It is this engagement that Becker and his command are most famous for .
In Operation Goodwood , Montgomery committed three armoured divisions in a narrow attack intended to pressure and degrade the German defenders and potentially break out into the open tank country just beyond at Falais .
The route of the attack would take the British armour through positions held by primarily by the 21st Panzer Division ’ s 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment , under command of Hans von Luck .
His command had been supplemented by a battalion of Panzer Mk IV tanks from the 22nd Panzer Regiment , a battalion of Tiger tanks from the 503 Heavy Panzer Battalion , and Becker &amp; apos ; s StuG 200 .
The Germans termed such an amalgamation a kampfgruppe , and used them throughout the war .
Kampfgruppes were named after their commanders , in this case &amp; quot ; Kampfgruppe Luck . &amp; quot ; The area of defense was farm land , interrupted by a scattering of small farm villages .
The Germans anticipated an attack through this sector , and had prepared a defense in depth to check such an attack .
Taking advantage of the stone walls of the old Norman buildings , the villages had been developed into strong points .
The range of the German anti-tank guns allowed overlapping fields of fire .
Though the land was considered good tank country the German defenders did not make use of mines , as they felt that would interfere with their plans of fighting a mobile defense .
The area prepared , however , extended back to a depth of 12 kilometers .
The defensive positions had been reviewed by Rommel on 15 July and he was reported to be satisfied .
Though engaged in battle over the previous six weeks , Becker ’ s SP battalion was still intact .
It held defensive positions behind the remnants of the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division south and east of Caen .
Becker &amp; apos ; s assault gun battalion was made up of five batteries each equipped with six 7 . 5 cm PaK40 / 1 &amp; apos ; s and four 10 . 5 cm leFH18 &amp; apos ; s .
The batteries were situated in concealed positions in the small farm villages , with his 1st Battery in Démouville , the 2nd Battery in Giberville , 3rd Battery in Grentheville , 4th Battery in Le Mesnil Frementel , and the 5th Battery in Le Prieuré .
In the event of a battle Luck intended his kampfgruppe to fight a mobile defensive battle , with a limited number of men tied to position defenses .
Becker &amp; apos ; s battalion was a key element in the defense .
The battle that unfolded proved to be the most important of his career . In the early morning hours of 18 July the entire defensive position came under an exceptionally heavy bombardment .
For nearly 2 hours the most concentrated aerial bombardment of the war was delivered , with over 2,000 Allied heavy and medium bombers dropping high explosives over the avenue of the planned attack .
This was followed by a naval and artillery bombardment that lasted for another 30 minutes .
When it was all over the air was still and filled with floating particles of dirt .
Luck had been away in Paris on a three day leave .
When he returned to his command post in Frénouville at 0900 , he found the area to be strangely quiet and the air clouded with dust .
From his aide he learned of the heavy bombing and attempted to contact his command , but all the communication lines had been cut and no one was answering the wireless .
Mounting a Panzer IV he moved slowly forward toward Le Mesnil Frementel .
Reaching Cagney he found the village largely destroyed .
Reconnoitering along the western edge he saw 50 to 60 tanks of the 11th Armoured Division across the corn field moving past to the south .
These leading tanks were moving toward their first objective : the villages of Bras and Hubert Folie at the base of the Bourguébus ridge .
Luck had nothing to check their advance , but as he pulled back he discovered a battery of four Luftwaffe 8 . 8 cm guns in an orchard just outside of Cagney .
The anti-aircraft battery was under Luftwaffe control , but Luck commandeered them , had them moved to the northwest edge of Cagny and instructed them to fire upon the second group of advancing tanks .
Promising to send his command staff infantry squad to screen them , he returned to Frénouville to try to piece together something to create a blocking position .
Said Luck : &amp; quot ; The main anti-tank defense units we had was the self-propelled assault gun battalion 200 commanded by one Major Becker . &amp; quot ; Becker arrived at Luck ’ s command post in Frénouville and reported he had established radio contact with all of his battery commanders .
Becker &amp; apos ; s unit communicated using a low frequency radio that had limited range but prevented the detection of the signal of origin by the Allies .
The short range signals had to be passed through the battalion by relay .
The commander of the battery in Démouville reported that all ten of the SP guns of his 1st Battery were destroyed in the bombardment .
The 2nd Battery at Geberville reported suffering damage but was still operational , while the 3rd , 4th and 5th Batteries were undamaged .
Directing his unit from von Luck &amp; apos ; s command post , Becker fought his batteries using ambush tactics and a mobile defense .
The leading elements of the 11th Armoured Division approached their objective of Bourguébus and Hubert Folie when they were hit by the SP guns of Becker ’ s Stug 200 firing from Grentheville , Le Mesnil Frementel and Le Prieuré .
Becker &amp; apos ; s vehicles were well hidden and camouflaged .
Firing into the flank of the advancing British armour , they caused considerable damage .
Major Bill Close , the commander of A Company , noted : &amp; quot ; In the cornfield around us were many mortar positions which were firing over our heads .
They were dealt with quickly , in some cases by simply running over them with the tank .
But the SP anti-tank guns of Major Becker &amp; apos ; s were a different matter .
Opening fire from concealed positions at almost point blank range , they hit three of my tanks out of the 19 in action , and they burst into flames .
I could see a squadron from 3rd Royal Tank Regiment to my left also had several tanks burning . &amp; quot ; Before the capture of Le Prieuré Major Becker withdrew 5 Battery back to Le Poirier , while he moved 4 Battery from Le Mesnil Frementel to the southeast of Four .
Becker moved 2 Battery from Giberville back to Hubert-Folie , while he kept 3 Battery in Grentheville .
Following the 23rd Hussars , the 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry were hit while crossing the cornfields to the east and suffered similar damage .
With Becker &amp; apos ; s anti-tank battalion and the Luftwaffe 88 ’ s at Cagney , Luck was able to check the British advance long enough to allow reinforcements to come up .
By mid-afternoon the attack had lost its impetus .
The leading British division in the assault , the 11th Armoured Division , had lost 126 tanks by the end of the first day , with the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment suffering the loss of 41 tanks , the 2nd Fife and Forfar losing 43 , the 23rd Hussars losing 26 and the Northamptonshire Yeomanry reporting 16 tanks lost .
The crisis for the defenders had passedThe following day the British 11th Armoured Division was largely withdrawn and the fighting was pressed forward with the Guards Armoured Division and the 7th Armoured Division .
On the German side the fight was dominated by the 1st SS Panzer and the 12th SS Panzer , reinforcements that had been drawn in to the battle .
Operation Goodwood ended having engaged and degraded the German armour , but well short of the threatened breakout .
The last major engagement of Becker &amp; apos ; s unit was Operation Bluecoat , another British offensive drive where Becker &amp; apos ; s weakened unit was committed to slow the progression of the 11th Armoured Division south of Saint-Martin-des-Besaces .
Those assault guns of Becker ’ s battalion that survived this engagement were destroyed in the Falaise Gap .
Becker and some of his men managed to escape the encirclement and retreated across northern France and into Belgium . As the remnants of the 21st Panzer Division retreated across the Seine and back to the frontier , Becker reached Belgium and set up his battalion headquarters in Fosses-la-Ville .
On 2 July 1944 Major Becker had been recommended for the award of the Ritterkreuzes zum Kriegsdienstkreuz mit Schwerter , or the Knight &amp; apos ; s Cross of the War Service Cross with Swords .
It was awarded to him at the end of 1944 .
After reaching the Rhineland , Becker was captured in late December 1944 in Alsace .
What became of him afterwards is not known . Major Becker was an industrialist and engineer with a knack for mechanical inventiveness .
He demonstrated a remarkable talent for improvisation in building useful self-propelled guns and reconnaissance vehicles from wrecks and obsolete captured equipment .
The great numbers of trucks and half-tracks Becker was able to refurbish provided much needed transport to the German army .
Many of the mobilized guns and armoured half-tracked vehicles were used to equip the reconstituted 21st Panzer Division , providing the division with a mobility and capability it otherwise would not have had .
The SP guns of his Sturmgeschütz Abteilung 200 proved very effective when handled as ambush weapons , as was demonstrated at Operation Goodwood and Operation Bluecoat .
Becker kept detailed records .
These included notes on his designs and photographs of his projects in various stages of completion .
Films were also made at his workshops and practice grounds for review by Adolf Hitler .
Though he had died by the time of its production , his extensive archive was used by the British Ministry of Defense for their 1979 battlefield training film &amp; quot ; Operation Goodwood . &amp; quot ; Ten years later Walter Spielberger made extensive use of Becker ’ s records and photographic images in his 1989 book &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Beute-Kraftfahrzeuge und Panzer der Deutschen Wehrmacht &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Captured Halftracks and Tanks of the German Military &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ) .
To this day , war-gamers and fine scale modelers exhibit a continuing interest in the many unusual and potent designs Becker created . Becker ’ s importance to the German war effort during the Second World War underscores the fact that by 1943 German industry lacked the productive capacity to keep up with the massive losses in equipment they were suffering in the east .

Low Light of the Hook of HollandThe Low Light of the Hook of Holland ( &amp; quot ; Lage licht van Hoek van Holland &amp; quot ; ) is a lighthouse that once stood at the Hook of Holland , but has since been dismantled and reassembled near the Rotterdam maritime museum .
An octagonal brick tower in height was built on the site of the low light in 1893 , with a higher tower behind it . It was designed by A . C .
van Loon . Coming from the sea , the low light would be seen first , then the high light behind it . When the two were aligned vertically the ship was on the correct course to sail the Nieuwe Waterweg ( New Waterway ) leading to the Port of Rotterdam . However , it was soon obvious that the low light was too low , and it was replaced by a round cast iron tower , the last cast iron lighthouse to be built in the Netherlands . The red cast iron tower was built in 1899 by Penn &amp; amp ; Bauduin of Dordrecht . It is made of many cast iron components bolted together . There are four floors and 42 steps . At first the tower had a 2,000 candlepower gas light .
In 1913 this was replaced by a 12,000 candlepower gas light . In 1921 the light was replaced by a 20,000 candlepower electric light . In 1967 the light was turned off and the tower painted grey . The construction of Europoort had extended the shore line , and the two lights were now too far from the waterway entrance . A temporary arrangement of spotlights on a scaffold was erected , and in 1974 nine modern concrete lighthouses replaced the old coastal lights . In 1977 the tower was transported in two parts from Leuvehaven to Rotterdam , and in 1990 it was erected in the Maritime museum in Rotterdam .
It was repainted to its original reddish-brown color . A similar tower to the old low light used to stand in Kijkduin . In 2004 this tower was transported by Chinook helicopter to the original site of the old low light . In 2006 a petition to return the old low light to its original site gained 2,000 signatures .

Oblivion ( M83 song ) &amp; quot ; Oblivion &amp; quot ; is a single by French band M83 featuring lead vocals from Norwegian singer Susanne Sundfør .
It was released as part of the film soundtrack album &amp; quot ; Oblivion : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack &amp; quot ; to accompany the film of the same name .
It was composed by Anthony Gonzalez . &amp; quot ; Oblivion &amp; quot ; has been classified as a &amp; quot ; soaring ballad &amp; quot ; that features &amp; quot ; interstellar synths and cloud-surfing lead vocals &amp; quot ; amidst a mixture of &amp; quot ; M83 ′ s dream pop &amp; # 91 ; and &amp; # 93 ; more traditional string and horn arrangements . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Rolling Stone &amp; quot ; observed that the song is &amp; quot ; capped with a jazzy instrumental section , just like M83 &amp; apos ; s 2011 hit Midnight City &amp; quot ; , while it reminded &amp; quot ; Consequence of Sound &amp; quot ; of &amp; quot ; Tangerine Dream ’ s scores from the &amp; apos ; 80s &amp; quot ; .
Featuring Sundfør &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; booming vocals , &amp; quot ; the song &amp; apos ; s choir repeats &amp; quot ; In the night , you &amp; apos ; ll hear me calling &amp; quot ; over a &amp; quot ; bombastic synth swell . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; The song was released as a single on 26 March 2013 , and later as part of the film soundtrack &amp; quot ; Oblivion : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack &amp; quot ; on 9 April .
On the French SNEP singles chart , the song debuted at number 114 on the week of 20 April 2013 , and lasted on the chart for three weeks .
M83 and Susanne Sundfør performed the song live on 17 April 2013 on &amp; quot ; Jimmy Kimmel Live ! &amp; quot ; , making it Sundfør &amp; apos ; s television debut in the United States .
Along with M83 and Sundfør , it featured a drummer , bassist and string section .
The performance was well received . &amp; quot ; The Express Tribune &amp; quot ; encouraged viewers of &amp; quot ; Oblivion &amp; quot ; to &amp; quot ; stick around for the credits that are set to M83 ’ s brilliant title song . &amp; quot ; Moviefone &amp; apos ; s Drew Taylor opined that it &amp; quot ; might be the best theme song since &amp; quot ; Skyfall &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; The Huffington Post &amp; quot ; compared it to the songs of Florence + The Machine , while Stereogum &amp; apos ; s Tom Breihan called it a &amp; quot ; slow , stately , and gorgeous &amp; quot ; collaboration .
Mark Hogan of &amp; quot ; Spin &amp; quot ; magazine commented that the best part of the song was its outro , as it included &amp; quot ; contemplative piano reminiscent of the &amp; quot ; Twin Peaks &amp; quot ; theme . &amp; quot ; Russ Fischer of / Film was more critical of the song , explaining that &amp; quot ; this one doesn ’ t do as much for me , as has the tenor of a lot of end credit songs that are tailored to be broadly appealing .
Your mileage may vary , however . . .
it ’ ll send a lot of people dancing out of the theater , at the very least , and Sundfør ’ s voice is quite pretty . &amp; quot ;

Gregor von BurtscheidGregor von Burtscheid ( c .
940 - 4 November 999 ) , also known as Gregor von Calabria or Gregory of Cassano , was the first abbot of the Burtscheid Abbey , founded on order of Otto III , Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire . Gregor von Burtscheid was known in Germany as Gregor von Calabria .
He was born in Cerchiara di Calabria ( Cosenza province ) in Calabria at a time when that region was still under the influence of the Byzantine Empire . Emperor Otto III founded the Burtscheid Abbey in 997 in the independent city of Burtscheid , and installed Gregor , who until this time was abbot of the Basilian monastery of St .
Andreas in Calabria , as first Abbot .
Gregor died 4 November 999 with a reputation as a holy man , and thus after his death , his bones were held in the nearby Nicholas Chapel ( &amp; quot ; Nikolaus-kapelle &amp; quot ; ) .
Around 1190 , an Abbot by the name of Arnold transferred the bones to the Abbey church . By the end of the 12th century , Gregor was bestowed &amp; quot ; the honor of the altars &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; zur Ehre der Altäre &amp; quot ; ) , and the date of his death was celebrated as a feast day at the abbey , until it was dissolved in 1802 . Due to the heavy bombing of Burtscheid on 11 April 1944 , Gregor von Burtscheid &amp; apos ; s grave was destroyed .
The remnants of his bones that could be salvaged were kept in a silver casket .
These small reliquaries were transferred in 1996 to the Berdolet altar , which stands in St .
Johann Church in Aachen-Burtscheid , where the previous abbey church once stood . Since 2010 , Abbot Gregor has been the patron saint of the dissolved rectories of St Gregorius , Sacred Heart , St .
John , and St Michael , as well as the patron of the newly founded parish of St .
Gregor von Burtscheid .

In an interview , Big Frame talent manager and Wonderly head Rachel Skidmore said : &amp; quot ; . . .
We saw , for example Squaresville and Life According to Jimmy — we saw that their audiences were kind of similar and it was this really amazing group of teen to early twenties girls that were rabid fans .
We realized that it wasn ’ t necessarily the content that was bringing them together but their obsession , in the coolest way .
These were girls that , even though they were subscribed to both channels , were also posting about books on Tumblr or they had their own channels ; they were just super fans .
So we thought “ How do we have a place where these creators can come together and sort of geek out together ? ” We started digging in and after many brainstorming sessions and hours of work and lots of pizza , Wonderly came to be . &amp; quot ;

Ripley VilleRipley Ville or Ripleyville was an estate of model houses for the working classes in Broomfields in the East Bowling ward of the City of Bradford in West Yorkshire , England . Started in 1866 the development was built for the industrialist , politician and philanthropist Henry William Ripley .
It was intended as a commercial development of model houses but when completed in 1881 had many aspects of an industrial model village – although residency was not limited to Ripley &amp; apos ; s employees .
It was the only model village in the Borough of Bradford and can be compared with Akroydon in Halifax , built by Ripley &amp; apos ; s friend and schoolmate Edward Akroyd , Saltaire and model housing schemes in other West Riding textile towns . Ripley Ville contained 196 workmen &amp; apos ; s cottages , a school and teacher &amp; apos ; s house , a church , allotment gardens and , on a separate site about a half-mile distant , a vicarage and ten almshouses which are still standing although all the other buildings had been demolished by 1970 . By the 1860s Ripley was managing partner of the Bowling Dye works , founded by his grandfather in 1808 .
In 1822 the dye works had relocated from West Bowling to a site in Spring Wood next to the Spring Wood Colliery pumping shaft – which supplied the works with steam and water .
The works employed 18 men and boys .
From 1835 as the junior partner Henry was &amp; quot ; regarded as the boss of the dyehouse &amp; quot ; .
He built up the business to be the biggest dye works in Yorkshire .
From the Bowling Iron Works he purchased the freehold of the dye works and about 100 acres of land surrounding it and subsequently built up the landholding to about 130 acres .
The landholding added to the available water supply – &amp; quot ; The whole of the water required for the supply of the works is an available source of 1,250,000 gallons per day &amp; quot ; .
To the dye works income he had added income from several mills rented out on a &amp; quot ; room and power &amp; quot ; basis , from a water works ( supplying 600,000 gallons per day ) and a gas works .
He was recognised as one of Bradford &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; big four &amp; quot ; industrialists alongside Titus Salt , Samuel Lister and Isaac Holden .
As a councillor , JP and public figure Ripley was deeply involved in the debates which engaged the recently ( 1847 ) incorporated borough council and its citizens . After four decades of rapid economic and population growth Bradford had some of the worst housing and sanitary conditions in the UK and about the lowest life expectancy .
A sanitary commissioner reported – &amp; quot ; Taking the general condition of Bradford , I am obliged to pronounce it to be the most filthy town I visited . &amp; quot ; In 1850 Titus Salt relocated his mills outside of the town and embarked on developing his model community at Saltaire .
Bradford &amp; apos ; s Building and Improvement Committee reported in 1855 to the council &amp; quot ; Your committee again beg to draw the attention of the Council and the public to the continued practice of building houses back-to-back .
Out of 1401 sanctioned , 1070 or 76 . 9 per cent are laid out upon that objectionable principle . &amp; quot ; .
Bradford council passed a series of building bylaws ( 1854 , 1860 , 1866 and 1870 ) intended to ensure that new houses were of a decent standard .
The bylaw of 1860 effectively banned construction of back to back houses which had been the predominant form of working class housing for 30 years .
The building interests mounted a campaign to have the bylaw rescinded , maintaining it was impossible to build &amp; quot ; through &amp; quot ; houses at a price that working-class people could afford and as evidence pointed to the precipitate fall in new building starts .
In the elections of 1865 the chairman of the Building and Improvement Committee lost his seat and was replaced by a councillor more sympathetic to the building interests .
In 1866 Bradford council issued a revised by-law which allowed construction of &amp; quot ; back to backs &amp; quot ; provided they met stringent requirements for space , ventilation , water supply and sanitary provision .
These &amp; quot ; tunnel backs &amp; quot ; became Bradford &amp; apos ; s predominant form of working class houses during the next 20 years .
The council approved no further plans for back to back houses after the 1870 bylaw but the builders had a sufficient stock of approvals to continue building them well into the 1890s . Ripley was not convinced by the arguments of the speculative builders .
In November 1865 he issued a prospectus for the construction of 300 &amp; quot ; Working-men &amp; apos ; s dwellings &amp; quot ; on his own land .
They were four-bedroom through houses with rear yards and front gardens and equipped with an internal WC .
The houses were intended for sale to small landlords and owner occupiers with a provision for rental purchase and some renting .
The Bradford firm Andrews and Pepper were appointed architects .
The specification for the Ripley Ville houses was influenced by the proponents of model housing , such as J . Hole and Godwin , editor of &amp; quot ; The Builder &amp; quot ; and the practices of contemporary model builders in the West Riding .
By the mid 1860s the views of the improvers had moved on from the provision of basic accommodation to considerations of lighting , ventilation , heating , storage , privacy and open space .
The design of the Ripley Ville houses incorporated these enhanced standards , and in several respects exceeded them . Planning permission to build 254 houses was granted on 24 January 1866 .
Four invitations to tender appeared in the &amp; quot ; Bradford Observer &amp; quot ; – the first on 23 March 1866 and the fourth and final on 21 March 1867 .
amounting in total to 200 houses .
The reduction in the number of houses to be built in part reflected the decision to include a school .
Planning approval for the school was given 8 June 1867 . All the houses were completed by early 1868 and the school was in use by autumn that year .
Houses built under tenders 1 and 2 were completed with internal WCs in the cellar .
A change of plan in spring 1867 led houses built under tenders 3 and 4 having external ash closets .
Tenders 1 and 2 houses were retrofitted with external ash closets and the WCs removed .
Reasons for the change remain obscure . On 11 December 1868 the Bradford Ten Churches Building Committee announced its intention to build its tenth church in Ripley Ville on land donated by Ripley .
T . H and F Healey who designed Our Lady and St James Church in Worsbrough were appointed architects .
St Bartholomew &amp; apos ; s Church was consecrated in December 1872 .
The architecture and townscape of Ripley Ville was complete and remained substantially unchanged until demolition a century afterwards .
In 1875 a vicarage for the incumbent of St Bartholomew &amp; apos ; s was completed on land given by Ripley at the extreme southern boundary of his landholding .
At that time it was a semi rural environment .
In 1881 ten almshouses were built at the cost of Ripley on a plot close to the vicarage .
Six of the almshouses replaced almshouses built in 1857 on a site which had been partly taken over by the Thornton Railway . In 1865 more than 80 acres of Ripley &amp; apos ; s land holding were still undeveloped .
The area was dotted with the Bowling Iron Company &amp; apos ; s former mine workings .
Several old mine shafts had been converted to wells to provide the dye works with its soft water supply .
Ripley Ville occupied most of the Broom Hall Estate : Broom Hall was a working farmhouse into the 1860s .
The northern part of the estate had been acquired by the Great Northern Railway Company ( GNR ) to build the Bowling Curves that opened in 1867 .
The site chosen for Ripley Ville had the disadvantage being irregularly shaped with steep gradients .
Its central street fell 40 feet over a distance of 300 feet but it was relatively free of old mine workings and contiguous to the urban development along Hall Lane which gave access to the town centre . The site &amp; apos ; s gradients and the irregular shape determined the architectural scheme .
Thirteen terraces of houses along four residential streets were laid out on a north – south axis .
The outer streets , Vere Street and Ripley Terrace had houses on one side and full width carriageways .
The internal Sloane and Saville Streets had 6 ft pedestrian walkways separating the front gardens .
The cobbled back streets provided access for wheeled traffic and contained the mains services ( water , gas , sewerage ) .
Three streets on an east-west alignment ( Ellen Street , Linton Street and Merton Street ) provided access to the residential streets and locations for retail premises and public buildings . The development had 196 houses with three sizes of house , 25 of the largest Type 1 houses in two terraces , 140 of the intermediate Type 2 houses in nine terraces and 31 of the smallest Type 3 houses in two terraces .
The front elevations , apart from a small difference in width , were identical for each type , and permitted a unified architectural scheme . The church was completed four years after the houses and school by other architects and it seems that Andrews and Pepper &amp; apos ; s scheme anticipated a major building at this point .
The impact of the completed scheme was dramatic , especially when viewed from the east .
Ripley terrace was virtually level along its 750 ft length .
The slight fall of about 4 ft was compensated for by building up gardens walls in the lower section so that doors and windows remained in alignment .
Behind the south section of the terrace the school buildings rose above the house roofs with the pinnacle of the clock tower about 50 feet above the roof ridge of the houses .
Behind the central and north sections of Ripley Terrace the roof lines of the successive terraces rose in echelon with the gable of St Bartholomew &amp; apos ; s rising 40 feet above the highest roofs .
The pyramidical theme was repeated in the front elevations of the terraces . Architectural punctuation of the terraces &amp; apos ; front elevations was provided by tall gables to the terminal and central houses .
In the north section the outer terraces had gables intermediate between the central and terminal houses .
Different designs of gable window were used in different terraces .
Left and right handed houses were used to provide symmetry .
In a left-handed house the front door was to the left of the ground floor window .
In a-right handed house it was to the right .
The handedness changed in the centre of the terrace and was marked by a gable house .
Between the gable house and its partner was a double chimney stack .
Thus there were no chimney stacks on the terminal walls of the terrace and each terminal wall had a front door adjacent to it . Externally the houses were of hammer-dressed Bradford stone set in black ash mortar with sills and lintels of sawn stone .
Brick was used for internal walls and liners to external walls but was nowhere externally visible .
House roofs were Welsh slate .
Privies were of hammer dressed stone with Elland Flag roofs .
Back yard walls were of hammer dressed stone , about 4 ft 6 in high and with triangular capstones .
Ripley Terrace and Vere Street front garden walls were about 3 ft high with broad rounded capstones surmounted by wrought iron railings .
Gardens of the internal &amp; quot ; front &amp; quot ; streets had wrought iron railings of about 3 ft 6 in height set on stone plinths and with wrought iron gates . All three types of house had two attic bedrooms , two first floor bedrooms and a cellar .
Ground floor designs varied between the types . Type 1 houses had a frontage of 16 ft 7 inches and a depth of 28 feet .
They had two large ground floor rooms and a scullery in a back extension .
The cellar was fitted out as a &amp; quot ; cellar kitchen &amp; quot ; with a sink and range .
The cellar also contained a WC and a coal store . Type 2 houses had a frontage of 15 ft 9 &amp; quot ; and a depth of 24 feet .
They had a large front ground floor room and a smaller back room .
The basement contained a storage cellar , WC in houses built under tenders 1 and 2 and coal store . Type 3 houses had a frontage of 16 ft 7 &amp; quot ; and a depth of 20 feet .
They had a single &amp; quot ; through room &amp; quot ; and small scullery on the ground floor .
The basement contained a storage cellar , a coal store and a second enclosure .
No WCs were fitted to type 3 houses , all of which were built under tenders 3 and 4 . All habitable rooms in the houses had gas lighting .
The streets were gas lit supplied from Ripley &amp; apos ; s gas works in Mill Lane .
All habitable rooms had a fireplace or range .
In the bedrooms fireplaces were decorative cast iron .
Type 1 houses had ranges in the back room and cellar kitchen and a polished slate fireplace in the ground floor front room .
Type 2 houses had ranges in both ground floor rooms .
Type 3 houses had a range in the single ground floor room . Internal staircases from the ground floor were constructed of stone .
Attic staircases were timber . The staircases were well lit by windows in the rear elevation .
Cellars and back rooms had stone flagged floors , other floors were suspended timberFront attic bedrooms were lit by casement windows in the dormer or on the case of gable houses a variety of decorative window designs .
All other windows above ground apart from the back attic bedrooms of end of terrace gable houses , which had sky lights were double opening sashes of large size .
Provision was made for built in storage .
Cellars were fitted with stone shelves and three storage alcoves set into the wall .
Living rooms had a cupboard mounted on a set of drawers .
Walk in clothes closets were provided on the attic landings .
In keeping with other Andrews and Pepper buildings all materials were of excellent quality and standards of workmanship and finish very high . Discussion about the superiority of the Ripley Ville houses compared to the average working class houses of the time focused on the provision of WCs .
In November 1866 Mr Gott , the corporation &amp; apos ; s chief engineer gave evidence to the Pollution of Rivers Commission .
He said there were 26,000 houses in the town and 19,500 privies – of which 1,500 were WCs , 6,000 ash pits and 12,000 pail closets .
Half of all houses , 13,000 in total , did not have sole use of a privy and WCs were installed in 5 . 7 % of the total housing stock .
WC &amp; apos ; s were a middle class preserve and virtually unknown in working class dwellings – other than the houses being constructed in Ripley Ville . A more useful comparator is habitable rooms per house and usable space in sq ft .
The typical working class cottage built in the 1850s was a &amp; quot ; one up and one down &amp; quot ; .
The houses in Fig . 4 in Hird Street ( built c . 1858 , under the 1854 bylaw ) are typical of this type- one is included in the table as a comparison with the Ripley Ville houses . Also included is an example of tunnel back to backs which were built in large numbers in Bowling after the 1866 bylaw change .
The tunnel gave access to the rear two houses and a group of four privies .
Most such houses exceeded the bylaw minimum ( the 1870 bylaw still permitted construction of the one up and one down ) by including a side scullery and often a small front garden .
In the example in the table the ground floor had a good size living room and a side scullery with access to the tunnel .
Such houses had either two or three bedrooms , the third being in a flying free hold over the tunnel .
Even the three-bedroom type was considerably smaller than the type 3 Ripley Ville house . The type 1 and 2 Ripley Ville houses were comparable in size to the houses built at Saltaire for supervisors and managers and to contemporary lower middle class houses elsewhere . It is difficult to judge how the example set by developers such as Ripley affected the standards of speculative builders .
Writing in 1891 William Cudworth had no doubt about the beneficial impact of the improved dwellings movement over the longer term .
&amp; quot ; There can be no question that the housing of the operative classes is comparably better than it was fifty years ago .
There is more provision for separate bedrooms . . .
The cottage of today with its wide streets and separate closets is a fair approach to sanitary perfection &amp; quot ; . Working class houses comparable in space and number of rooms to the Ripley Ville houses started to be built in Bowling from about 1895 and were built in large numbers between 1900 and 1914 .
From about 1906 they usually had a bathroom with a WC on the first floor .
Use of a transverse staircase as opposed to the longitudinal staircase in the Ripley Ville houses allowed access to a bathroom in addition to the rear bedroom .
Retro fitting of bathrooms to the earlier houses of this type was accomplished by partitioning the rear bedroom .
The transverse staircases were very steep compared to the Ripley Ville staircases and had no direct lighting .
In most houses of this period attic bedrooms were lit only by skylights and did not have fireplaces .
Although this type of house was comparable to the Ripley Ville houses of a half century earlier some aspects of the design were less satisfactory . The 1911 census shows that the recently built houses were occupied by the upper stratum of the working classes with a high proportion of white collar workers and school teachers .
The lower strata of the working classes had to await the building of council estates in the 1920s and 1930s to obtain three and four-bedroom houses with a bathroom and garden . The school building was financed by Ripley and run by the non-denominational British and Foreign School Society It was designed by Andrews Son and Pepper in a gothic revivalist style .
The halls and classrooms were on a single level with service rooms in a basement .
Internally the ground floor ( total area 4,192 sq .
ft . ) was mainly taken up by two large halls of double height .
The south hall of 1600 sq .
ft .
accommodated the girls primary school and the northern hall of 1300 sq .
ft .
accommodated the boys .
Two smaller classrooms accommodated the infants .
Later photographic evidence suggests that the class room block as built varied from the plan .
Instead of two unequally sized classrooms with an entrance lobby to the north there were two equally sized rooms separated by a centrally placed entrance lobby .
The entrance door was beneath a gabled semi-dormer with a round window in the gable – very similar to the gables of the north façade . The formal entrance to the school was through a carved and columned arched doorway on the ground floor of a very decorative clock tower .
The tower was about 75 ft in height and had four clock faces – illuminated at night . Each of the two play grounds had a pupils &amp; apos ; entrance : junior girls and infants in the west and junior boys in the east .
Boundary walls , gates and railings to the street frontages were similar to those of the workmen &amp; apos ; s cottages . The large halls were separated by sliding panels which could be drawn back to create a single space of about 2,900 sq ft .
which was used for social events and public meetings .
Contemporary press reports refer to the &amp; quot ; fine and spacious hall &amp; quot ; where &amp; quot ; between four and five hundred people sat down to tea . &amp; quot ; The teacher &amp; apos ; s house had three levels and apart from ornate external stone carving was similar in size and features to the workmen &amp; apos ; s cottages .
The basement contained a storage cellar , pantry and space for a WC .
As with the houses and school building it is not certain that any WC &amp; apos ; s were actually installed .
The ground floor contained two living rooms , one with a sink , range and access to a private yard .
An entrance hall opened to the stair hall .
At the mezzanine landing of the stair was a door into the school corridor .
On the first floor there were two bedrooms , each with a fireplace , and a smaller bedroom in the clock tower .
Flues from the four fireplaces were carried to a single central chimney stack supported by an arch ( hidden in the roof space ) across the stair hall .
This was unusual and expensive form of construction , but visually impressive . Heating of the halls and classrooms was by coke stoves .
In the 1880s Ripley &amp; apos ; s estates department converted the north hall for use as offices .
A central heating boiler was installed in the basement and the coke stoves were replaced by radiators .
Some features of the building prefigured , on a smaller scale , Andrews and Pepper &amp; apos ; s design for the grammar school in Manor Row ( 1872 ) . St Bartholomew &amp; apos ; s was the last church constructed under the Bradford Ten Churches building Campaign inspired by Charles Hardy , managing partner of the Low Moor Iron works and a leading Anglican layman .
Ripley agreed to provide a site at no cost after he and Hardy had inspected it in 1868 .
The building cost in excess of £ 7,000 , was largely met by donations from the Hardy family .
The church contained a chapel with a window dedicated to the memory of Charles HardyIn 1870 T .
H and F .
Healey were appointed architects .
Planning permission was given in January 1871 and the Incorporated Church Building Society ( ICBS ) approved the design and a grant towards the cost .
Site preparation works involving large-scale engineering started immediately .
The foundation stone was laid at a service of dedication in April 1871 and the church was consecrated in December 1872 .
The bell turret was finished in 1874 when ICBS paid its grant towards the costsPress articles covering the dedication and consecration ceremonies provide a detailed account of the architecture .
The style was a simplified Early English .
External masonry was Bradford stone and its roof was made of green Westmoreland slate .
The churchyard had low stone walls with decorative wrought iron railings and gates .
Internally the church walls were of pressed brick with moulded capitals to the columns and arches of polychrome brick – reportedly , &amp; quot ; a very cheerful effect &amp; quot ; .
Its 740 sittings were provided free . The church occupied the dominant site in Ripley Ville and with the west gable apex 70 ft above street level the external appearance was very impressive . The first vicar , Mr Rice , lived in a rented house at 22 Edmund Street which still exists .
The parish , under the leadership of Ripley , decided a more permanent arrangement was needed .
Ripley donated the site ( 0 . 406 acres ) on New Cross Street about half a mile south of the church .
The architects were T . H and F Healy who placed an invitation to tender in the &amp; quot ; Bradford Observer &amp; quot ; on 26 February 1874 .
The vicarage was completed in 1875 , costing £ 2,050 .
The Ecclesiastical Commissioners provided £ 1,300 and the parish raised £ 750 from benefactions .
Contemporary press articles describe it as &amp; quot ; on the scale of a &amp; quot ; gentleman &amp; apos ; s residence &amp; quot ; and as having &amp; quot ; both day and night nurseries &amp; quot ; .
No plans survive but from the large scale Ordnance Survey map its ground area can be measured as 2036 sq . ft compared with the 505 sq . ft .
ground area of a type 1 Ripley Ville house . By the late 1920s the vicarage was uneconomic .
Vicars &amp; apos ; salaries were insufficient for domestic servants and it may have been affected by mining subsidence . ( The adjacent Durston &amp; apos ; s House was demolished about that time . ) It was sold to a property developer who demolished and replaced it with a row of houses by 1931 .
The parish took the lease of a detached house at 205 Hall Lane until 1942 when on amalgamation of the St Luke &amp; apos ; s parish with St Bartholomew &amp; apos ; s the former St Luke &amp; apos ; s vicarage in Caledonia Street became available .
Both the vicarages were early-19th century houses of elegant classical design .
The Caledonia Street house had been built for a local mill owner in 1834In 1881 Ripley paid for ten almshouses in New Cross Street a short distance from the vicarage .
Six replaced alms houses built in 1857 by his parents near their house , Bowling Lodge .
The old almshouses site had been partly taken over by the GNR line from Ripleyville to Thornton .
The commemorative plaque of 1857 was re-affixed to the new almshouses which are grade II listed .
The architect was James Ledingham who had worked as an assistant to Andrews and Pepper . Plans deposited by Ledingham show that each house had a ground area of about 350 sq .
ft . ( the projecting end of terrace houses were slightly larger ) with a frontage of about 18 ft .
On the ground floor front was a living room containing a range .
To the rear was a scullery with a sink and access to a back yard containing an ash house , coal store and a gate to a service road .
On the first floor front was a bedroom with a fireplace and walk in wardrobe .
On the mezzanine level was a WC . The relative isolation of the area where the vicarage and almshouses were built was greatly reduced in 1881 when the GNR opened Bowling Junction station , about 50 yards distant from the almshouses .
It had services to Bradford ( about 5 minutes journey time ) , Leeds , Halifax and Wakefield . Occupancy of the almshouses was not limited to former Ripley employees but was open to all old residents of Bowling .
Occupants received an allowance of 3 / - per week . Six end terrace houses adjoining Linton Street and two adjoining Ellen street were retail premises at the time of the 1871 census .
All except No 2 Vere Street continued in commercial use until demolition .
Architectural and structural changes were in most cases carried out at the time of construction . Ripley would not allow the sale of beer in Ripley Ville – although the 1872 Smith &amp; apos ; s Directory records Stephen Gibson of No 2 Linton Street as a grocer , tea dealer and beer retailer .
Initially there was no public house but residents could drink at the Locomotive Inn ( which predated Ripley Ville ) at No 7 Ellen Street or in Hall Lane at the Bowling Hotel or any of the four beer retailers recorded there in Smiths Directory . During the 1870s the shop at No 2 Linton Street was joined to the adjacent house ( 40 Saville Street ) and modifications undertaken .
The 8-bedroom building was run by Mrs Gibson as a shop and coffee tavern and probably a temperance hotel .
In the 1890s ( after Ripley &amp; apos ; s death ) Benjamin Spenser obtained a beer license .
Under the name Gibson Hotel it continued as the village pub until demolition . In 1874 the Co-op opened a store at No 10 Ellen Street replacing temporary store at No 5 Ellen Street .
Branch 11 was an imposing building and continued trading until demolition in 1960 . Ripley &amp; apos ; s expectations for the model development were not fully met .
He had intended the houses should be for outright purchase – but very few , mainly the end terrace houses adapted for retail use , were purchased outright .
A scheme for rental purchase was abandoned because of low take up .
Most of the houses were offered for rent but the take up was slow .
Ripley &amp; apos ; s political opponents accused him of charging exorbitant rents .
The 1871 census returns bears out the slow take up and high rent levels .
In one terrace of 13 houses 7 were unoccupied .
Overall 17 of the 196 properties were unoccupied and 24 were in multiple accommodation . In 1868 the building society movement was still in its infancy .
Caffyn notes – &amp; quot ; By the late 19th century many building societies &amp; apos ; requirements excluded less affluent workers from membership .
Borrowers from the Bradford Equitable Building society and the Feehold Land Society for example , were largely foremen , clerks , school-masters , shopkeepers and the like . . &amp; quot ; Only in the first decade of the 20th century were significant numbers of working-class people in south Bradford able obtain a mortgage for house purchaseThe &amp; quot ; Bradford Observer &amp; quot ; gave an impression of an active community life in Ripley Ville .
Cricket and football teams were successful in local leagues .
Meetings and other events took place in the school hall on a regular basis .
There are reports of teas and tea evenings , usually with Ripley hosting the event and making a speech .
The opening of the Co-op store was marked by an event at Ripley Ville school .
Speeches were made by officers of the Bradford Industrial Society and by the Rev A . B Cunningham , a travelling lecturer of the University Extension Movement .
Other meetings were held to raise money for the vicarage and church organ , and to celebrate its installation in 1878 .
In 1881 when it was announced that the parish of St Bartholomew &amp; apos ; s had a debt of £ 800 , Ripley led the fund raising campaign and it was paid off in months .
The tone of press reports show Ripley greatly enjoying himself as leader of his new communityThe Thornton Railway , of which Ripley was an enthusiastic proponent , opened in 1878 with a station , St Dunstan &amp; apos ; s , in Ripley Ville .
The following year the line was extended to Halifax and in 1883 to Keighley .
Ripley Ville was a node on the expanding rail network .
With services to Bradford , Leeds , Halifax , Wakefield and intermediate villages and suburbs the station expanded commercial and job opportunities for the residents . A main sewer from The Roughs to central Bradford was completed by Bradford Corporation .
The Ripley Ville sewer system , installed 1866-8 but out of use following the change of plan over WCs , was connected to it .
Subsequently the external ash closets of the Ripley Ville houses were converted to WCs . Sir Henry Ripley ( knighted in 1881 ) died in early 1882 .
His younger son , also Henry , succeeded him as manager of the dye works .
After his death most of Sir Henry &amp; apos ; s property , including the Ripley Ville estate , was administered by a body of trustees .
The junior school ceased to operate in the early 1880s when the Board School took its pupils .
Ripley &amp; apos ; s trustees and their estates office moved into the junior school accommodation .
The infants school continued until just before the First World War .
Its premises continued in use as a parish hall and village social centre until after the Second World War . Successive census results give a picture of a prosperous and stable community .
Ripley had achieved his aim of providing houses for the working classes but the census returns of 1881 and 91 show that the residents represented the upper stratum of working class occupations .
White collar occupations were well represented , especially in the type 1 houses of Vere Street .
Skilled craftsmen and self-employed tradesmen were numerous , with the construction and engineering trades well represented .
Some residents had become members of the middle classes .
Edward Wright of no .
83 Ripley Terrace , described in earlier censuses as a master mill-right , engineer and employer of labour , is described in later censuses as the owner of an engineers &amp; apos ; tool supply company . In 1899 ownership and control of the dye works passed to the newly created Bradford Dyers Association .
Members of the Ripley family ceased to have any personal relationship with Ripley Ville . In 1896 the Midland Railway obtained an act of Parliament authorising it to build a through railway from its main line at Royston to connect with its existing tracks at Bradford Foster Square .
The proposed line of railway passed under Ripley Ville .
The Midland &amp; apos ; s cash offer of £ 6,000 for the purchase of Ripley property was unacceptable to the Ripley Trust who also felt that there was a direct threat to the soft water supply to the dye works .
An Arbitration hearing in 1900 awarded the Ripley Trust £ 14,000 for 3 acres of land in Ripley Ville .
This included 4 terraces of houses and a strip of land across Ladywell Fields .
After another Act of Parliament in 1912 and several changes of plan the Midland Railway decided , in the changed economic circumstances after the Great War , to abandon the scheme .
Bradford Corporation ( who were wholly in favour of the scheme and deeply regretted its abandonment ) agreed to buy all the land acquired by the Midland .
This included , in addition to much land in the centre of the city , the four terraces of houses in Ripley Ville and Ladywell fields .
Ladywell Fields were designated as a public park .
Management of the four terraces of houses passed to the Borough &amp; apos ; s housing department . With control of Ripley Ville rented houses divided between Ripley &amp; apos ; s Trustees and the Corporation there were no co-ordinated attempts to upgrade and modernise the estate .
Both landlords followed a policy of minimum maintenance .
Ripley &amp; apos ; s Trustees undertook no external painting after about 1920 .
Linton Street and Merton Street remained un-adopted .
They had never been paved other than with a scattering of blast furnace slag .
Vere Street , Ellen Street and the back streets had cobbled carriageways and flagged pavements and remained in a fairly decent state .
The council &amp; quot ; tarmaced &amp; quot ; Ripley Terrace when it became a bus route . There was no electricity supply to the houses until 1938 when supply cables were laid by the municipal power authority .
Ripley &amp; apos ; s Trustees required tenants to contribute to the cost of connection ( £ 60 in 1958 ) so take up was slow .
Some houses still used gas lighting in the 1960s .
By that time the estate had a very neglected appearance .
Removal of the iron gates and railings &amp; quot ; for the war effort &amp; quot ; in 1941 had made maintenance of front gardens very difficult – especially in the internal rows where there were no garden walls . Under the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act , Bradford Corporation adopted &amp; quot ; The Bradford Development Plan &amp; quot ; in 1951 .
( Mainly authored by Stanley Wardley , the city &amp; apos ; s Chief Engineer ) The plan envisaged large scale demolition of 19th-century houses in Bowling and redevelopment for &amp; quot ; light industrial &amp; quot ; use .
In the late 1950s the Corporation &amp; apos ; s demolition program approached Ripley Ville .
By 1958 the houses in Hird Street and most of those in Hall Lane had been demolished .
The Ellen Street co-op and St Bartholomew &amp; apos ; s church had been demolished by 1962 .
In 1970 the Ripley Ville houses and School were demolished and the site levelled for redevelopment .
There were few protests and no mention of the desirability of preserving an historical and architectural heritage . Apart from minor changes the pattern of land use on Ripley &amp; apos ; s land holdings and the built environment established at the time of Henry Ripley &amp; apos ; s death continued into the 1960s and until the demolition of Ripley Ville in 1970 .
Subsequently Ripley &amp; apos ; s dye works and mills have also been demolished and redeveloped and previously undeveloped land has been built on .
In recent years ( 2014 ) even some major railway engineering features have been obliterated and it is now difficult to see how former land use relates to the modern landscape .
Fig . 16 shows some of the earlier features superimposed on a recent ( 2014 ) street map . Unlike his contemporaries Titus Salt and Samuel Cunliffe Lister , Henry William Ripley had no biographer .
Information about Ripley and Ripley Ville must be drawn from a wide range of sources .
Principal sources are listed in the bibliography .
Some must be treated with caution . Henry William Ripley and his model village of Ripley Ville were well covered by contemporary press articles .
Bradford had a very active local press at that time .
Rhodes &amp; quot ; Bradford Past and Present &amp; quot ; provides a history and list of publications to 1890 .
The article is anonymous but the author was probably William Cudworth .
The &amp; quot ; Bradford Observer &amp; quot ; in particular is a very rich source of comments and reports .
Digitised copies are available on the British Newspaper Archive website .
Copies of other local publications are held at Bradford Library . The various works of the local historian and reporter William Cudworth , a younger contemporary of Ripley , are also a valuable source of information .
In the &amp; quot ; History of Bowling &amp; quot ; he provides an account of the geology and mining history of the area and describes the deepening of former pumping shafts to the Rough Rock level to tap the soft water aquifer .
He provides a history of the dye works and in his references to Ripley Ville gives details of the rental purchase scheme and its abandonment .
However , the usually reliable Cudworth misdates &amp; quot ; .
the building of Ripley Ville to 1863 – 4 – an error perpetuated by some later authors . Cudworth &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Historical Notes on the Bradford Corporation &amp; quot ; provides an account of the development of water and sewage works and the building by-laws . Few publications between Cudworth &amp; apos ; s death and the 1970s dealt directly with Ripley , Ripley Ville or the history of Bowling and for this period newspaper reports are the principal source of information .
The &amp; quot ; Centenary Yearbook &amp; quot ; ( 1947 ) records that Bradford &amp; apos ; s sewage treatment problems were not properly solved until completion of the Esholt scheme in the early years of the 20th century and that the water supply problems continued until completion of the Nidderdale scheme in the inter war years .
Writing in 1982 David Wright noted in the Introduction to &amp; quot ; Victorian Bradford &amp; quot ; that &amp; quot ; Although Bradford produced some eminent historians of the city in the Victorian age , its history during the first half of the twentieth century remained sunk in a mass of antiquarianism and neglect .
Only on the last fifteen years or so has there appeared a significant and fruitful crop of academic historical studies &amp; quot ; .
These studies from about 1970 were often inspired by Jack Reynolds of the University of Leeds or sponsored by Bradford Library and the recently ( 1966 ) chartered Bradford University . The unpublished dissertation by Derek Pickles shows that the eastern and southern boundaries of Ripley &amp; apos ; s landholding followed the lines of former coal tramways , and that Ripley Road which bisected the dye works was also a tramway route .
Richardson &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Geography of Bradford &amp; quot ; ( 1976 ) provides a modern spatial analysis and shows the impact of earlier transport and mining features on the location of subsequent industrial and residential developments .
A paper &amp; quot ; All Change &amp; quot ; ( 1986 ) presented to the Bradford Society of Antiquaries describes how the Midland Railway Company &amp; apos ; s scheme for a through line led to divided ownership of the Ripley Ville estate . Publications by Caffyn , Sheeran and Jowitt ( 1986 – 1990 ) deal directly with workers houses in the 19th century .
They provide many house plans , photographs and descriptions .
They also describe the works of &amp; quot ; model builders &amp; quot ; and the aims of the &amp; quot ; model housing &amp; quot ; movement .
All make reference to Ripley Ville but include no plans or photographs .
Cafin &amp; apos ; s remit from the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments was to record extant buildings so such an absence is understandable : Ripley Ville had been demolished twenty years before the time of her survey .
Sheeran and Jowitt probably had no good documentary evidence available .
The location of Andrews and Pepper &amp; apos ; s archive , if it still exists , is unknown .
The plans included in Ripley &amp; apos ; s prospectus and planning applications ( Deposit Plans ) held at Bradford library are no more than rough sketches .
Absence of evidence may also account for the incorrect statements by Koditschek &amp; quot ; – that &amp; quot ; Ripley built 300 cottages to sell on mortgage to his workers . . . When it became clear that the model dwellings were beyond the means of the majority of workers , a less ambitious scheme was implemented , providing cheaper units only marginally superior to existing housing in other working-class districts . . .
Ripley Ville disappeared as a distinctive community and remained only a name on a map &amp; quot ; In 2008 R . L Walker published a well researched booklet &amp; quot ; When was Ripley Ville Built ? &amp; quot ; .
The booklet finally laid to rest Cudworth &amp; apos ; s incorrect dating .
Using documents and copies of newspapers held at Bradford Library Walker established the dates and contents of Ripley &amp; apos ; s prospectus for the Ripley Ville houses , the grant of planning approval and issues of invitations to tender by Andrews and Pepper .
This placed Ripley &amp; apos ; s initiative firmly in the context of the &amp; quot ; bylaw revolt &amp; quot ; and 1865 local elections .
The expansion of the scheme to include a school and church were placed in the context of Henry Ripley &amp; apos ; s transition from local to national politician .
One of the first events in the school ( reported in the &amp; quot ; Bradford Observer &amp; quot ; ) was a meeting in support of Ripley &amp; apos ; s candidature in the 1868 parliamentary election . In 2011 R . L Walker established a website &amp; quot ; Rediscovering Ripley Ville &amp; quot ; .
The site has stimulated interest in the history of Ripley Ville and the dye works .
Several of the &amp; quot ; guest posts &amp; quot ; are by former residents of Ripley Ville , who have provided copies of rare photographs .
Some former residents had retained survey notes and measured drawings of the houses – details of which have been posted on the site .
These are the source of the plans and section drawings shown in Fig .
6 . Another local history website &amp; quot ; My West Bowling &amp; quot ; has photographs of Ripley Ville and the surrounding area .
The site also contains a series ( 1891 – 1934 ) of large scale ( 1 : 2500 ) Ordnance Survey Maps , available for viewing or download .
These maps were marked up by Smith , Gotthard &amp; amp ; Co .
Land Agents and Surveyors to show land ownership boundaries ( including Ripley &amp; apos ; s landholdings ) and ownership changes .
The 1911 maps are marked up to show the Midlands &amp; apos ; s through railway scheme described in &amp; quot ; All Change &amp; quot ; . Records and papers of Ripley &amp; apos ; Dye Works and Ripley &amp; apos ; s Trustees are held at the West Yorkshire Archive , Wakefield .
The WYA site provides an on line index to the collection

More Than a Lover &amp; quot ; More Than a Lover &amp; quot ; is a song recorded by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler from her debut studio album &amp; quot ; The World Starts Tonight &amp; quot ; ( 1977 ) .
It was released by RCA Records in January 1977 , shortly before the release of the album , and was written by her at-the-time producers Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe . The song was Tyler &amp; apos ; s third single in her career and second charting single , following &amp; quot ; Lost in France &amp; quot ; ( 1976 ) .
Its highest chart placing was number 7 in South Africa , and it also made the UK Top 30 .
Music critics praised Tyler for recording a song that could be seen as controversial . Tyler &amp; apos ; s previous hit single &amp; quot ; Lost in France &amp; quot ; became a European hit single , and was due to be released in the United States when &amp; quot ; More Than a Lover &amp; quot ; was due for a European release .
In December 1976 , Tyler informed &amp; quot ; Record Mirror &amp; quot ; that her follow-up single to &amp; quot ; Lost in France &amp; quot ; would be &amp; quot ; much more gutsy &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; The World Starts Tonight &amp; quot ; was aimed at a February / March release in 1977 , and &amp; quot ; More Than a Lover &amp; quot ; was released one month ahead of the album . &amp; quot ; Record Mirror &amp; quot ; described the song as &amp; quot ; more meaty &amp; quot ; than &amp; quot ; Lost in France &amp; quot ; , but didn &amp; apos ; t think the song was as commercial as its predecessor .
Similarly , &amp; quot ; The Sydney Morning Herald &amp; quot ; described the song as the &amp; quot ; next most commercial song to &amp; quot ; Lost in France &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; Tyler performed &amp; quot ; More Than a Lover &amp; quot ; live on &amp; quot ; Top of the Pops &amp; quot ; on 31 March 1977 . The song progressed slowly in the charts ; it was released in January 1977 , but it took until March for the single to reach the UK Top 50 .
Further success was hampered when the BBC banned the song from being played on any associated music programs due to a BBC producer &amp; apos ; s view that the song contained sexual innuendos .
Its highest UK chart placing was number 27 , though it narrowly missed the Top 5 in South Africa .

Samuel Jackson ( lawyer ) Samuel Jackson ( 16 April 1831 – 29 July 1913 ) was a solicitor in Auckland , New Zealand .
He worked in his profession until shortly before his death and was at the time the oldest practising solicitor in the country , and was regarded as the father of his profession in his city .
He joined the solicitor Frederick Merriman and they called their firm Merriman &amp; amp ; Jackson .
Upon Merriman &amp; apos ; s death in 1865 , he took on a new partner and the firm was renamed Jackson Russell , by which name it is still known today .
In his younger years , he was involved in provincial politics . Jackson was born in 1831 in Providence Green , Green Hammerton , near Harrogate , Yorkshire , England .
He was the son of Samuel Jackson ( 1806 – 1858 ) , a brewer and yeoman who owned and farmed his land , and Sarah Jackson ( née Hughlings ; 1807 / 08 – 1836 ) , the daughter of a Welsh revenue collector .
His mother died when he was five .
He had three brothers and a sister ; all but his youngest brother emigrated to New Zealand . His parents had married on 24 March 1828 .
His oldest sibling was his sister Ann ( 30 April 1829 – 9 August 1859 ) .
She died three days after giving birth to her first child .
He himself was the oldest of the brothers and he was born on 16 April 1831 , and baptised a month later on 24 May .
His brother William was the third of the children ; he was born on 11 October 1832 and baptised a month later on 12 November .
Thomas ( 2 December 1833 – 15 November 1906 ) was the next sibling .
He became a mariner and also emigrated to New Zealand .
His youngest brother , John ( 4 April 1835 – 7 October 1911 ) , remained in England and became a prominent neurologist . Jackson studied law at the University of York , then joined the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1853 .
He emigrated to New Zealand in 1855 on the &amp; quot ; Merchantman &amp; quot ; and arrived in Auckland from Plymouth on 4 September 1855 .
Amongst the other passengers was the family of Reverend James Mandeno .
He married Sarah Anne Mandeno , the eldest daughter of the family , on 26 August 1856 . On 8 April 1864 , John Anderson Gilfillan and Jackson were appointed to the Executive Council of the Auckland Provincial Council ; they replaced William Daldy and Joseph May .
Whilst Gilfillan had previously been a provincial councillor as well as a member of the executive council , neither of them were provincial councillors at that time , and Jackson was never an elected member .
The source does not state an end date for Jackson &amp; apos ; s membership of the executive council .
From 21 July to 12 October 1865 , Jackson was the 5th Deputy-Superintendent of Auckland Province . Within two weeks of arriving , Jackson made the necessary declaration and was admitted as an attorney and solicitor of the Supreme Court .
Within a short time , he worked in the office of the solicitor Frederick Merriman .
In July 1856 , the first advertisement of &amp; apos ; Merriman &amp; amp ; Jackson &amp; apos ; appeared in the &amp; quot ; Daily Southern Cross &amp; quot ; , the largest Auckland newspaper at that time . Upon Merriman &amp; apos ; s death in 1865 , the firm was joined by James Russell and was renamed Jackson Russell .
James Russell retired from the firm about 1903 on the death of his brother , Thomas Russell , who had been Chairman of Directors of the Waihi mine .
Jackson had a long and distinguished legal career , and gained the respect of the whole profession .
He practised until approximately a year before his death and was thus active in his profession in New Zealand for over 55 years , which made him the oldest practising solicitor in New Zealand at that point .
He became generally regarded as the father of the profession in Auckland .
His firm is still known as Jackson Russell today . During his career , Jackson advised many rich benefactors regarding their bequests .
When John Edward Elam came to see him about a suitable cause to leave his estate to , Jackson suggested that a school that teaches fine art was needed .
As a result , the Elam School of Fine Arts was set up .
Edward Costley had no relatives , so proposed to leave his wealth to Jackson and his children , to which Jackson replied : &amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; m cosy .
Leave it to Auckland . &amp; quot ; Seven charities benefited from Costley &amp; apos ; s estate , and one of the buildings at Greenlane Hospital came from this .
Another case was James Dilworth , who bequeathed the bulk of his estate to the Dilworth Ulster Institute Trust , which established Dilworth School with this funding . Since his marriage in 1856 , Jackson lived at Orakei Road , Remuera .
Before trams were introduced , he walked to his office in downtown Auckland on a daily basis , a distance of each way . Their first child was christened Samuel , and he was sent to England for his secondary education and to study law .
Samuel Jackson Jr .
joined the legal profession in Auckland , but emigrated to Oakland , California , USA , in 1890 .
A further son , born in 1870 , was christened John Hughlings . Jackson died on 29 July 1913 at his residence and was survived by his wife and several children : Samuel Jackson ( by then living in San Francisco ) , John Hughlings and G .
J .
Jackson ( auctioneers in Auckland under the name T .
Mandeno Jackson ) , Thornton Jackson LLB ( employed at Jackson and Russell ) , Mrs A .
Blair ( of Wellington ) , Mrs W .
Madill ( of Auckland ) , Miss Ruth Jackson , Mrs Proude ( of Auckland ) , H .
Hughlings Jackson ( Chief Mechanical Engineer at the New Zealand Railways Department ) , and Mrs Andrew Hanna ( of Auckland ) .
His son Thomas Mandeno Jackson , the founder of the auctioneering business , had died five years before him .
At the time of his death , he had 23 grandchildren .
José Acevedo y GómezJosé Acevedo y Gómez ( Charalá , Santander , 1773 - Caquetá , May 1817 ) was an independence hero of Colombia .
With an educational background of grammar and philosophy , he became a highly skillful orator and political figure , attaining the position of the Attorney General .
He generated a vast wealth through his trading activities .
He was honored with a bust in the patio of the Palacio Liévano . Born in 1773 in Charalá , he was baptized in the Monguí parish .
He was descendent of noble Spanish families on both sides .
He studied at the Our Lady of the Rosary University .
While he read the classics and liberal philosophers of the eighteenth century , he did not pursue a degree .
Instead , he developed skills in trade .
He evolved as a very good orator , and with this skill he could promote freedom movements of the country . In the field of business trading , which he operated from 1810 from Bogotá , his cousin Miguel Tadeo Gomez Duran ( in 1810 , Gomez Duran was also an administrator of a royal trading company in Socorro ) was his partner .
He was considered a rebellious merchant . He moved to San Gil where he held various public offices .
In Bogotá , he delivered his oratory , &amp; quot ; The Tribune of Pueblo &amp; quot ; .
Here , he prospered as a trader , while training in law and philosophy . In 1808 , he was appointed Perpetual Regidor of the Cabildo of Santa Fe .
The same year , Spain was invaded by the French , and Acevedo participated in the oath of allegiance to King Ferdinand VII , but also stated the need to form a Governing Board .
During 1809 , he engaged in conspiracies seeking to depose the Viceroy Antonio José Amar y Borbón , to form an independent government .
He became interested in the emerging proposals for the emancipation of the American colonies and decided to begin organizing meetings with other intellectuals and leaders of the city which culminated with the Cry of Independence of Colombia of July 20 , 1810 , when street riots began , turning chaotic and ineffective .
Popular leaders proclaimed their tribute to Acevedo , trying to harness his excellent oratory skills , and he addressed the crowd at the central square of the city with a speech that fueled the need to seize the moment to organize as an autonomous government .
He stated : With six other patriots , Antoni Narino , Camilo Torres Tenorio , Francisco Jose de Caldas , Jorge Tadeo and Lozano , he met on 20 July 1810 and proclaimed the independence of the Viceroyalty of New Granada .
They had gathered in the main plaza of the country ’ s capital city , Bogotá , in an open air meeting .
The seven patriots of the group were known as the &amp; quot ; Colombian Founding Fathers &amp; quot ; .
On the morning of 21 July 1810 , a document was drafted by Antonio José known as the “ Act of Independence ” and was signed by the members of the group .
This document clearly spelt out the autonomous status of New Grenada to be governed under Federal system .
The autonomy was to enable the people to govern themselves through a constitution .
Following this declaration there were agitations and riots between rival groups of people .
This group &amp; apos ; s decision called the junta proclamation stated that “ it no longer recognized the Supreme Regency Council , marking a decisive moment : no corporation or person located in or hailing from the peninsula have authority over these lands except for Ferdinand VII . ” During the period known as &amp; quot ; Patria Boba &amp; quot ; , Acevedo participated in the independence rebellions of Cundinamarca and Tunja .
He held positions in government during the Patria Boba .
But when the forces of General Pablo Morillo regained much of United Provinces of New Granada , Acevedo took refuge in the jungles of Caquetá .
While there , he fell ill and died in May 1817 .

Vickie StringerVickie Stringer is an American novelist from Detroit , Michigan . Stringer grew up in Detroit , Michigan .
Her mother was a schoolteacher and her father was an electrical engineer for General Motors .
She graduated from the prestigious Cass Technical High School in 1985 .
She briefly attended Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo and was in the process of transferring to Ohio State University when she became romantically involved with a drug dealer .
The two had a son in 1992 , after which Stringer and the boy &amp; apos ; s father separated .
In order to support herself and her son , Stringer then turned to dealing drugs herself , and also worked as a manager of an escort service . In September 1994 , Stringer was arrested on federal drug trafficking and money-laundering charges after selling two- kilograms of cocaine to a police informant in Columbus , Ohio .
She pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and money laundering and received a seven-year sentence in a federal prison . While in prison , Stringer wrote her first novel &amp; quot ; Let That Be The Reason &amp; quot ; .
She was released from prison in January 2001 , and began working as a bartender .
Stringer attempted to interest publishers and agents in her manuscript and was rejected twenty-six times .
She borrowed money from her family and had a printer make a small number of copies of her book , which she then marketed and sold on her own .
Sales were so good that Stringer soon had enough capital to found Triple Crown Publications - named after her drug crew - to publish her works and those of other writers , principally in the urban fiction genre , aimed at a demographic largely ignored by major publishers .
Publisher Weekly Magazine named her , &amp; quot ; The Reigning Queen &amp; quot ; of Urban fiction and Book Magazine name one of the &amp; quot ; Most 50 influential Women &amp; quot ; in publishing .
Additionally , her novel has been translated in Japanese for worldwide distribution and acclaim . Stringer &amp; apos ; s second novel , &amp; quot ; Imagine This &amp; quot ; , was purchased by Simon &amp; amp ; Schuster imprint Atria Books as part of a six-figure two-book publishing deal .
As with her debut ( &amp; quot ; Let That Be The Reason &amp; quot ; ) novel , &amp; quot ; Imagine This &amp; quot ; spent more than a two years on the Essence paperback bestseller list .
Simon &amp; amp ; Schuster Atria offered Stringer additional publishing deals which resulted in more best-sellers as her well-received &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Red Series &amp; quot ; : Dirty Red , Still Dirty , Dirtier Than Ever , Low Down &amp; amp ; Dirty and Dirty Love . &amp; quot ; Stringer is credited for creating the genre , &amp; quot ; Hip-Hop &amp; quot ; fiction by the niche success of her publishing company Triple Crown Publications . In its 15th year in business Triple Crown Publications has broken barriers and launched the carriers of the biggest literary names in the urban fiction genre .
As a literary agent she is responsible for brokering over 3 million dollars in book deals for her clients . She is the publisher of Triple Crown publications , one of the most successful African American book publishers in the U . S .
and abroad .
She has been featured in such prominent news media as The New York Times , Newsweek , MTV News , Publishers Weekly , Vibe , Millionaire Blueprints , Writer &amp; apos ; s Digest , Black Expressions , Essence and many more . Stringer has won Ball State University Entrepreneur of the Year ( 2007 ) by the Miller College of Business . Stringer has participated in the John Jay College of Criminal Justice : Facilitating Re-entry Venturing Beyond the Gates to study the theory of using entrepreneurship to reduce recidivism .
Stringer &amp; apos ; s success story was used as an example of this possibility .

Sales force compensation “ The incentive plan needs to align the salesperson ’ s activities with the firm ’ s objectives . ” Toward that end , an effective plan may be based on the past ( growth ) , the present ( comparison with others ) , or the future ( percentage of goal achieved ) . The purpose of the sales force compensation metric is to determine the mix of salary , bonus , and commission that will maximize sales generated by the sales force .
When designing a compensation plan for a sales force , managers face four key considerations : level of pay , mix between salary and incentive , measures of performance , and performance-payout relationships .
The level of pay , or compensation , is the amount that a company plans to pay a salesperson over the course of a year .
This can be viewed as a range , because its total will vary with bonuses or commissions . Managers enjoy considerable freedom in designing compensation systems .
The key is to start with a forecast for sales and a range within which each salesperson ’ s compensation should reside .
After these elements are determined , there are many ways to motivate a salesperson .
Key formulas in this area include the following : After a sales compensation plan has been established , management may want to reevaluate the size of its sales force .
Based on forecasts for the coming year , the firm may have room to hire more salespeople , or it may need to reduce the size of the sales force .

Renascence ( poem ) &amp; quot ; Renascence &amp; quot ; ( also &amp; quot ; Renasance &amp; quot ; ) is a 1912 poem by Edna St .
Vincent Millay , credited with introducing her to the wider world , and often considered one of her finest poems . The poem is a 200 + line lyric poem , written in the first person , broadly encompassing the relationship of an individual to humanity and nature .
The narrator is contemplating a vista from a mountaintop .
Overwhelmed by nature , and thoughts of human suffering , the narrator empathetically feels the deaths of others , and feels pressed into a grave .
Friendly rain brings the narrator back to joy in life — the rebirth , or &amp; quot ; renascence &amp; quot ; , of the title . Millay &amp; apos ; s fame began in 1912 when the nineteen-year-old , encouraged by her mother , entered her poem &amp; quot ; Renascence &amp; quot ; in a poetry contest in &amp; quot ; The Lyric Year &amp; quot ; .
Millay had written and published poetry in &amp; quot ; St .
Nicholas &amp; quot ; , a children &amp; apos ; s magazine , throughout her teen years , and had become a proficient poet .
At some point , Millay wrote &amp; quot ; Renascence &amp; quot ; while looking out from the summit of Mt .
Battie in Camden , Maine ( where a plaque now commemorates the writing of the poem ) .
The poem may have been influenced by Millay &amp; apos ; s childhood experience of nearly drowning .
Her mother , Cora Millay , saw an announcement for a poetry contest sponsored by &amp; quot ; The Lyric Year &amp; quot ; , an annual volume of poetry , and encouraged Edna to enter the poem into the contest .
The poem was well received and was published in the annual volume , along with other best entries .
On publication , Millay &amp; apos ; s poem was widely considered the best submission , and her eventual award of fourth place caused a major scandal .
The first-place winner Orrick Johns was among those who felt that &amp; quot ; Renascence &amp; quot ; was the best poem , and stated that &amp; quot ; the award was as much an embarrassment to me as a triumph . &amp; quot ; A second-prize winner offered Millay his $ 250 prize money .
The scandal brought Millay much attention , and &amp; quot ; Renascence &amp; quot ; was widely distributed and even taught to schoolchildren as an exemplar of American poetry .
Millay used the publication to promote her own career , maintaining correspondence with editors and poets who congratulated her on her publication . In the immediate aftermath of the &amp; quot ; Lyric Year &amp; quot ; controversy , wealthy arts patron Caroline B .
Dow heard Millay reciting her poetry and playing the piano at the Whitehall Inn in Camden , Maine , and was so impressed that she offered to pay for Millay ’ s education at Vassar College .

The album &amp; apos ; s sole guest appearance comes from frequent collaborator Drake .
The album &amp; apos ; s production was primarily handled by DannyBoyStyles , The Weeknd himself and Jason &amp; quot ; DaHeala &amp; quot ; Quenneville , among others . &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; received generally positive reviews from critics .
The album debuted at number two on the US &amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; 200 , selling 95,000 copies in its first week .
As of August 2015 , the album had sold 273,000 copies in the United States . On March 17 , 2013 , The Weeknd announced his debut album would be titled &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; .
In July 2013 , Amazon . com revealed that the album would be released on August 27 , 2013 .
On July 22 , 2013 , it was announced that the album would be pushed back from August 27 , 2013 , until September 10 , 2013 .
In July 2013 , during an interview with &amp; quot ; Complex &amp; quot ; , The Weeknd described the album , saying : &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; symbolizes the tour life , but it &amp; apos ; s a world that I created in my head .
Just like &amp; quot ; House of Balloons &amp; quot ; symbolizes Toronto and my experiences there , but it &amp; apos ; s a world that I created .
When I think about &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; , I think about a terrifying place .
It &amp; apos ; s a place I &amp; apos ; ve never been to before that I &amp; apos ; m very unfamiliar with .
A lot of it is inspired by filmmakers like John Carpenter , David Cronenberg , and Ridley Scott , because they know how to capture fear .
That &amp; apos ; s what &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; is to me , an environment that &amp; apos ; s just honest fear .
I don &amp; apos ; t know who I am right now and I &amp; apos ; m doing all these outlandish things in these settings that I &amp; apos ; m not familiar with .
To me , it &amp; apos ; s the most terrifying thing ever .
So when you hear the screams in the record and you hear all these horror references and you feel scared , listen to the music because I want you to feel what I &amp; apos ; m feeling .
&amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; is like a horror movie .
He also explained the album &amp; apos ; s second single &amp; quot ; Belong to the World &amp; quot ; , saying : &amp; quot ; Belong to the World &amp; quot ; is about falling in love with the wrong person .
There are some songs where I talk about the same person , but I like to make every song about someone else .
&amp; quot ; Thursday &amp; quot ; is a conceptual album .
Whatever that situation was , I spent the whole album focusing on that situation . &amp; quot ; He also explained where the title &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; came from , saying : &amp; quot ; I didn &amp; apos ; t want to call it &amp; quot ; Dark World &amp; quot ; or something so generic .
The title came from a conversation that I overheard and those words stuck out .
Someone said , &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; and I thought , &amp; quot ; That &amp; apos ; s going to be the title of my album . &amp; quot ; It sounds so ridiculous .
When I put &amp; # 91 ; the title &amp; # 93 ; out everyone was like , &amp; quot ; What the hell ? This is going to be corny .
It &amp; apos ; s going to be all lovey-dovey . &amp; quot ; On July 21 , 2013 , the album cover was released .
On September 1 , 2013 , the entire album was made available for streaming on NPR Music . On May 17 , 2013 , the first single &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; was released .
On June 25 , 2013 , the music video was released for &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; .
On July 15 , 2013 , the music video for the second single &amp; quot ; Belong to the World &amp; quot ; was released .
The song was released the following day on July 16 , 2013 .
On July 30 , 2013 , the song and music video were released for &amp; quot ; Love in the Sky &amp; quot ; . On July 30 , 2013 , &amp; quot ; Love in the Sky &amp; quot ; was released digitally as the third single from &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; .
On August 20 , 2013 , the track &amp; quot ; Live For &amp; quot ; , which features Drake , impacted mainstream urban radio and was released along with the pre-order of the album on the iTunes Store .
It was released as a digital single three days later , and its music video followed on September 11 .
On October 25 , 2013 , &amp; quot ; Pretty &amp; quot ; was serviced to urban contemporary radio in the United States .
On September 20 , 2013 , the music video for &amp; quot ; Pretty &amp; quot ; premiered on Vevo .
&amp; quot ; Wanderlust &amp; quot ; was released as the sixth single in the United Kingdom on March 31 , 2014 . &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; received generally positive reviews from critics .
At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 65 , based on 31 reviews .
Chris Payne of &amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; stated , &amp; quot ; Blissfully hi-fi headphone candy that &amp; apos ; s not far from the Weeknd &amp; apos ; s mixtape trilogy , but with an added flair for the dramatic . &amp; quot ; In a review from &amp; quot ; Clash &amp; quot ; , Grant Brydon noted that &amp; quot ; Rather than upgrading to studio album status by hiring an all-star cast of contributors , &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; sticks to the familiar formula of 10 tracks , as per the mixtapes , with a single guest appearance from previous collaborator Drake .
Tesfaye hasn &amp; apos ; t turned to gimmicks for &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; .
Instead , he &amp; apos ; s managed to transcend his previous efforts via the scaling up the sonics and simply maintaining the quality of this excellent record . &amp; quot ; In a more critical review , Anupa Mistry of &amp; quot ; Spin &amp; quot ; saying that &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; plays like a more considered , better-mastered continuation of &amp; quot ; Echoes of Silence &amp; quot ; , not anything dramatically different .
And in that way , the dude from Toronto who created a shift is saying that he &amp; apos ; ll shift again only when he &amp; apos ; s ready . &amp; quot ; Andy Kellman of AllMusic said , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; is more personal , more human , and will draw his fans closer to him .
The slightly wider vocal range and additional expressiveness don &amp; apos ; t hurt his cause .
For those who aren &amp; apos ; t as easily drawn into Tesfaye &amp; apos ; s world , this will seem roughly as insufferable and as bleakly aimless as the earlier material . &amp; quot ; Jesse Cataldo of &amp; quot ; Slant Magazine &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; The music is never up to the conceptual task , and the album too often settles for numbing backdrops , with songs like &amp; quot ; Belong to the World &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Wanderlust &amp; quot ; resembling wan impersonations of Bad-era Michael Jackson . &amp; quot ; Ian Cohen of &amp; quot ; Pitchfork &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; is technically the Weeknd &amp; apos ; s fourth album in two and a half years , and without the ear-turning innovation of the earlier work , all you can muster in reaction to its worldview , the same one that &amp; apos ; s been delivered repeatedly without variation , is , &amp; quot ; Maybe it &amp; apos ; s you , man . &amp; quot ; Which in a way , vindicates it : &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; sounds every bit as isolated and singular as Tesfaye feels . &amp; quot ; August Brown of the &amp; quot ; Los Angeles Times &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; For an act founded in anonymity and reserve , it turns out the Weeknd &amp; apos ; s most convincing work of art is Tesfaye &amp; apos ; s own rollout as a star and storyteller .
&amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; is a rough place to visit .
But then again , when it comes to sex and loneliness , we &amp; apos ; ve all been there . &amp; quot ; Omar Burgess of &amp; quot ; HipHopDX &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; This album is a polished , lateral step with an accompanying barcode for Weeknd &amp; apos ; s fans .
And outsiders looking to understand his appeal are likely better off downloading the three mixtapes that preceded the album . &amp; quot ; Corey Beasley of &amp; quot ; PopMatters &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; It &amp; apos ; s easy to catch the way &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; attempts to turn &amp; quot ; Trilogy &amp; quot ; s afterparty ennui into a big screen , on-the-road , b-movie melodrama ( something like &amp; quot ; Only God Forgives &amp; quot ; , with even less of a plot ) .
Still , the punches seem half-pulled , and the production glides by without much of an impact . &amp; quot ; Mike Madden of &amp; quot ; Consequence of Sound &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; Apart from its mild lyrical slips , &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; doesn &amp; apos ; t really have any cosmetic issues , just relative shortcomings when you consider the singular thrills his 2011 output offered .
The 23-year-old Tesfaye will almost certainly make a bigger , better record soon .
For now , &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; works fine as one of the year &amp; apos ; s most fearless pop releases . &amp; quot ; Julia LeConte of &amp; quot ; Now &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; is proof for the unconvinced : the Weeknd is a star whether he wants to be or not .
And his voice .
Oh , that delicious falsetto .
Even seven-and-a-half minutes isn &amp; apos ; t long enough . &amp; quot ; Stephen Carlick of &amp; quot ; Exclaim ! &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; The latest effort from the Weeknd is a mixed bag , but it can &amp; apos ; t be said that Abel Tesfaye is resting on his laurels .
While many criticized his second two mixtapes , &amp; quot ; Thursday &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Echoes of Silence &amp; quot ; , for being subpar reiterations of what he did so perfectly on &amp; quot ; House of Balloons &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; is anything but a retread . &amp; quot ; Nick Catucci of &amp; quot ; Entertainment Weekly &amp; quot ; named it the fifth best album of 2013 saying , &amp; quot ; a nearly hour-long head trip in which sexual obsession , betrayal , addiction , and big-ticket trust issues tangle like limbs under silk sheets .
It &amp; apos ; s Tesfaye &amp; apos ; s delicate falsetto — and dark , distinctly &amp; apos ; 80s guitar and synth sounds — that envelops you everywhere else .
It &amp; apos ; s a weirdly exhilarating experience , with the bonus effect of torpedoing the make-believe encouraged by cheery online dating profiles . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Kiss Land &amp; quot ; debuted at number two on the US &amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; 200 with 95,000 copies sold in its first week , just 2,000 copies short of Keith Urban &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Fuse &amp; quot ; , which took the number-one spot that week .
As of August 2015 , the album had sold 273,000 copies in the United States . All tracks produced by DannyBoyStyles , The Weeknd and Jason &amp; quot ; DaHeala &amp; quot ; Quenneville , except where noted . NotesSample credits

British Druid OrderThe British Druid Order ( BDO ) is an international druid order , founded in 1979 as a religious and educational organisation .
Its constitution defines it as a not-for-profit unincorporated association .
It is commonly regarded as being one of the first , if not the first , explicitly neo-pagan Druid Orders .
The order draws on medieval Welsh texts such as the Mabinogion and other early British / Celtic texts for inspiration and to re-connect with the pre-Christian , indigenous religious and spiritual practices of Britain which it believes to be shamanic in nature . Founded in 1979 with the creation of the original Mother Grove , The Grove of the Badger , in Hastings , Sussex , England by Philip Shallcrass , the current Chief of the Order . By 1992 , the BDO was publishing and disseminating pagan literature focused on the shamanic traditions of the Islands of Britain . The Gorsedd of Bards of Caer Abiri was co-founded at Avebury in 1993 by the BDO with ritual designed by Philip ShallcrassIn 1995 , Philip Shallcrass was joined by Emma Restall Orr as joint chief of the order . The first US Gorsedd , Caer Pugetia , was founded in Seattle during a visit to America by the joint chiefs of the Order in 1997 and the Gorsedd of Bards of Cor Gawr founded at Stonehenge as part of the BDO &amp; apos ; s work to extend ritual access to the site . In 2002 , Emma Restall Orr stepped down as joint chief of the order in order to set up The Druid Network , following which in 2003 the BDO Circle of Elders was formed . By 2010 , the BDO had completed construction of an Iron Age style Roundhouse which has since been the focus of training , workshops and ritual for the order .
2011 saw the launch of the BDO &amp; apos ; s Bardic training , with its first Bards graduating in 2013 . 2013 also saw the launch of the Druid Hedge Schools initiative , a loose network of pagan Druid trainings intended to promote Druidry as a spiritual practice in the modern world . The British Druid Order follows the contemporary tradition of neo-druidry with its threefold division of the Order membership into Bards , Ovates and Druids . BDO Druidry The order believes that the pre-Christian , indigenous religious and spiritual practices of the original Druids were shamanic in nature , and works to reconstruct such practices in a form as a spiritual system answering to the needs of the 21st century where possible and to reconnect with the spirit of them where not , a process referred to by the BDO as &amp; apos ; rekindling the sacred fire . &amp; apos ; Practically , the British Druid Order seeks to understand and work with the spirit of inspiration and creativity known in the British Druid tradition as &amp; apos ; awen &amp; apos ; through study , ritual , folklore , healing and many other practices to facilitate connections to sources of knowledge , inspiration and wisdom beyond the confines of the human psyche and rooted in the natural world .
It also sees political and practical activism , in the areas of ecology , as a spiritual obligation . The following is a list of publications that the BDO have produced .
Tooth and Claw is still published on an occasional basis .

Sandra MeigsSandra Meigs , ( born 1953 , Baltimore , MD , USA ) is a Canadian visual artist based in British Columbia , Canada . Sandra Meigs was born in Baltimore , Maryland in 1953 .
She began her career as a painter in Toronto , and in 1993 , moved to Victoria , British Columbia where she is a Professor in Visual Arts at the University of Victoria .
Meigs obtained her Bachelor of Fine Arts at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design , in Halifax in 1975 , and then completed her Master of Philosophy at Dalhousie University ( also in Halifax ) in 1980 . Meigs ’ paintings have been widely exhibited in Canada and internationally .
She is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts . Meigs is known for her vivid , enigmatic paintings that combine dense narratives with comic elements .
Her paintings are often provocative , providing layers of meaning that are gradually revealed .
Her work typically explores psychological spaces and philosophical ideas , and , as John Bentley Mays notes in a National Post article , “ &amp; # 91 ; Meigs ’ &amp; # 93 ; topics are those of the cave-painters of the Stone Age and artists ever since : the body , light and darkness , storytelling . ” Her works usually contain an element of paradox that encourages viewers to look for multiple meanings .
As David Jager writes in NOW Magazine , “ Sandra Meigs ’ textured surfaces and silhouette shapes seem casually naive at first glance , but they are actually carefully planned .
Layering the canvas with gesso , she produces smooth raised lines and surfaces whose negative spaces hold as many surprises as her blobby and colourful shapes . ” Meigs works in various media and often experiments with new techniques and unusual combinations of materials .
Her 2010 body of work entitled &amp; quot ; The Fold Heads &amp; quot ; , for example , straddles the line between painting and sculpture . In 2015 she was awarded the Governor General &amp; apos ; s Award in Visual and Media Arts and the Gershon Iskowitz Prize . Meigs &amp; apos ; work is included in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada .

High MaintenanceHigh Maintenance is an American comedy-drama television and web series created by ex-husband and wife team Ben Sinclair and Katja Blichfeld .
The show follows a nameless marijuana deliveryman called &amp; quot ; The Guy &amp; quot ; ( played by Sinclair ) as he delivers his product to clients in New York City .
Each episode focuses on a new set of characters as they all procure their cannabis from Sinclair &amp; apos ; s character . &amp; quot ; High Maintenance &amp; quot ; originally premiered as a web series on Vimeo on November 11 , 2012 and began airing as a television series on HBO on September 16 , 2016 .
The show &amp; apos ; s second HBO season premiered on January 19 , 2018 . On February 21 , 2018 , HBO renewed the series for a third season . Almost all of the episodes in this character-driven series are named after an unseen peripheral character that someone in the episode mentions ( the one exception being &amp; quot ; Heidi &amp; quot ; ) .
The characters are meant to be relevant , regardless of whether or not the viewer engages in similar activities .
This web series is shot throughout various neighborhoods in Brooklyn and occasionally Manhattan .
Each episode is between five and twelve minutes in length .
&amp; quot ; Freed of the constraints of thirty-minute or one-hour formulas , the episodes are luxurious and twisty and humane , radiating new ideas about storytelling , &amp; quot ; wrote television critic Emily Nussbaum in an article for &amp; quot ; The New Yorker &amp; quot ; . Sinclair said that the TV shows &amp; quot ; Six Feet Under &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Party Down &amp; quot ; were inspirations for the web series . The talent pool in New York City is rich — and familiar to Blichfeld ( who is an Emmy Award-winning casting director of &amp; quot ; 30 Rock &amp; quot ; ) .
Each episode cost less than $ 1,000 to make . In June 2014 , Vimeo announced that the website would provide financial backing for upcoming episodes of original programming via their Vimeo on Demand platform . Vimeo funded six episodes of &amp; quot ; High Maintenance &amp; quot ; before the series was picked up by HBO .
Three episodes were released November 11 , 2014 , and the remaining three on February 5 , 2015 . Critical response has been positive .
The actor Dan Stevens calls it &amp; quot ; a brilliant collection of succinct character portraits from a cross-section of New York society &amp; quot ; .
Jenji Kohan said that &amp; quot ; High Maintenance &amp; quot ; was one of her favorite recent discoveries , calling the episodes little jewels , &amp; quot ; beautiful glimpses into people &amp; apos ; s lives , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; really well crafted , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; delicious . &amp; quot ;
Rapid control prototypingRapid Control Prototyping ( RCP ) is a process that lets engineers quickly test and iterate their control strategies .
Consequently , mathematical models are automatically imported with MATLAB / Simulink ( TM ) on a real-time machine with real I / O interfaces to connect to real-world systems .
RCP solutions can be used with different real-time solutions in hardware and software such as Speedgoat GmbH , dSpace , National Instruments , OPAL-RT and others . RCP benefits : RCP decreases development time by allowing corrections to be made early in the product process .
By giving engineering a look at the product early in the design process , mistakes can be corrected and changes can be made while they are still inexpensive .

A studio- and object-oriented artist , Magor ’ s work emphasizes process and materiality , and highlights the difference the real and the simulated . In previous work , Magor used mould-making and casting techniques to make replicas of coats , trays and cutlery ( which she calls “ serviceable objects ” ) as receptacles for other materials ( such as candies or cigarettes ) .
These works reference the accumulation of discarded goods and vices that appeal to our common impulses .
They also raise questions about the social and emotional life of objects .
Magor ’ s more recent work involves the repurposing of used clothing and old wool blankets ( other types of “ serviceable objects ” ) . In her article entitled &amp; quot ; Magor &amp; apos ; s Timeless Transitions &amp; quot ; , Robin Laurence writes , “ Art , Liz Magor says , is the place where our perceptions are opened and examined for prolonged periods of time .
Much longer , she suggests , than in our day-to-day encounters with the visual world , where we tend to interpret given signs in fixed ways , and where our first impressions are usually consolidated by our second &amp; # 91 ; impressions &amp; # 93 ; .
Magor &amp; apos ; s art refutes such consolidation : irresolution prevails and closure eludes us .
Her sculptures consistently play reality against unreality , meaning against alternative meaning , initial appearance against later revelation . ” Books by Liz Magor

Oakham HillOakham Hill is one of the highest points in the county of Hampshire , England , and in the South Downs , rising to above sea level . Oakham Hill rises about 1 kilometre southeast of the village of Buriton in Hampshire and just a few hundred metres east of the county boundary with West Sussex .
Just to the west are the summits of Head Down ( 205 m ) , War Down ( 244 m ) and the highest point in the South Downs , Butser Hill ( 270 m ) , in the heart of the Queen Elizabeth Country Park .
On the southern spur of Oakham Hill is Ditcham Park School , a private educational establishment . Oakham Hill is also the site of the British Schools ’ Cycling Association &amp; apos ; s National Hill Climb Time Trial , which in 2013 attracted one hundred and sixty competitors between the ages of 5 and 16 , 34 of which were also pupils of Ditcham Park School .

He later attended Loughborough University , and was director of cricket at Loughborough Grammar School from 1995 until his retirement in 2013 .
The Terry Thomas BuildingThe Terry Thomas Building , located in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle , Washington is a sustainable , LEED-certified office building completed in 2008 .
The Terry Thomas is Seattle &amp; apos ; s first commercial office building structure developed in decades without central air conditioning .
It was designed by Seattle-based architectural firm Weber Thompson , who also designed the interiors of the building and use it as their headquarters . The former building - a light industrial warehouse from the 1920s - was once used as a practice space for one of Seattle &amp; apos ; s best known bands , Pearl Jam .
Most of the existing , two-story building was salvaged for reusable building materials and components , in particular , the brick and heavy timber .
93 % of the materials reclaimed during demolition were recycled and 94 % of construction waste was recycled . The Terry Thomas was designed to provide a healthy and creative work environment and to illustrate the possibilities of sustainable design .
The project was driven by Weber Thompson , who was looking for space to accommodate their expanding architectural practice .
The firm wanted to stay in the neighborhood in a building that reinforced their commitment to sustainable design . The building is a redevelopment of an urban site in the Seattle neighborhood of South Lake Union .
The mixed-use neighborhood , formerly a light industrial zone , includes parks , multi-family residences , offices ( including the Amazon . com campus ) and light industrial buildings .
It is also located on the South Lake Union Streetcar line . The project goals for the building were to develop a sustainable building without air conditioning .
Sustainable strategies incorporated into the design include shallow floor plates , operable windows , a central , open air courtyard , different treatments on the façades to minimize heat retention , and floor to ceiling glass at optimal height to depth ratios and open floor plans to maximize daylight . The building is constructed out of recycled steel , aluminum and fly ash concrete .
Interior finish materials were produced using sustainable methods with high-recycled content .
The windows and storefront are locally manufactured , as is the metal exterior cladding .
The exterior cladding of the building also includes FSC-Certified ipe wood .
The interior minimizes the use of additional finish materials . Materials were chosen for their ability to serve multiple functions .
Castellated beams were integrated into the structure to reduce the weight of steel used and to encourage air movement .
The exposed concrete slab was polished and used as the finish floor surface .
The castellated steel beam structure , chosen for strength , lower cost , and reduced material was left exposed and painted white , allowing light , air and services to circulate .
The metal cable tray system corrals electrical and data cabling also serve as the support for the light fixtures .
Ceiling mounted acoustical panels double as light reflectors .
Acoustical wall panels provide additional noise damping and a place to pinup sketches . The courtyard doughnut shape is critical to the two main design priorities : daylighting and natural ventilation .
Natural daylighting was achieved through the shallow floor plate depths and high ceilings allowing for light to penetrate the interior of the offices from both the exterior of the building and the core open-air courtyard .
Daylighting models were tested at the University of Washington ’ s Integrated Design Lab to ensure even lighting and minimizing glare to users working on computers .
Within the bulk of the building , daylight sensors are on all lighting within 15 feet of the windows and Energy Star equipment is provided to reduce the plug load . Automated blinds are installed on specific windows that modeling predicted would receive the most sun .
These “ smart blinds ” automatically adjust depending on the sunlight levels and orientation .
On the roof , sensors with hemi-spherical lens acts as photocells , monitoring the intensity of lights .
A wind sensor causes the blinds to retract into their housings when the wind exceeds 40 mph .
Interior controllers on the ceiling are programmed based on the blinds ’ orientation towards the sun , building latitude and an astronomical clock that tracks the seasons . Passive cooling is achieved through multiple design strategies ; the most significant being operable windows .
The windows are enhanced by automated louvers , high ceilings , a shallow floor plate , and a central court that acts as a chimney , drawing the warmer air out the windows and up through the courtyard .
Exterior shading devices protect occupants from significant solar heat gains and a white roof keeps the upper floors cool while reducing the urban heat island effect .
Every exterior façade is treated differently , according to its micro-climate and sun exposure . Good indoor air quality was of paramount importance in the design of the building .
Low-emitting materials such as low-VOC paints , adhesives and carpets were specified to minimize the impact of off gassing on the air quality .
CO2 sensors throughout the building control exterior louvers that deliver fresh air into the space .
Operationally , a recycling program is mandatory and tenants are committed to use recycled and environmentally-friendly products in their daily operations and cleaning .
A green building operations manual and a tenant manual were developed for all tenants . Lighting is controlled by several methods .
Photoelectric eyes measure the amount of sun coming into the space and increase or decrease the fluorescent lighting to balance the light levels in the office .
Occupancy / motion sensors turn lights on and off in conference spaces and the lights are programmed to turn off automatically at night and on weekends .
These strategies reduce the wattage per square foot to 35 % below the baseline of one watt per square foot . Only one elevator was integrated into the building , an energy-efficient but slow model .
Use of the stairs by employees is encouraged by a prominent and accessible outdoor staircase in the courtyard , while the elevator is located towards the back of the building .
In order to accurately measure the energy consumption and gauge the effectiveness of the design strategies , sub-metering was installed for all tenants . The Terry Thomas was also designed to conserve as much water as possible .
A storm water drainage system was designed to detain runoff into an on-site tank , and then slowly release it to the city storm water system .
Low-flow fixtures , dual-flush toilets and waterless urinals were installed in order to save an approximate 50 % of the water during everyday operation as compared to a typical office building . The Terry Thomas was originally modeled to reduce its energy use by 30 % to 40 % from that of a typical office building with conventional air conditioning .
Eliminating a traditional HVAC system contributes significantly to energy savings .
As part of this energy reduction , the designers increased thermal insulation .
Heating is provided by highly efficient hydronic radiators placed along exterior walls ; this allows for individual temperature control .
Based upon the Department of Energy ’ s National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency metric , The Terry Thomas consumes 56 % less energy than a typical class A office building .

Coalshaw GreenCoalshaw Green is a locality in the town of Chadderton in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham , Greater Manchester . It is a former hamlet located in the south east of the township around the junction of Turf Lane and Drury Lane , and is contiguous with Butler Green , Whitegate and Hollinwood . Coalshaw Green Park , which opened in 1911 , is Chadderton &amp; apos ; s oldest public park .
It comprises a formal park and , until 2017 , adjoining playing fields . The Chadderton Cricket &amp; amp ; Bowling Club , known locally as &amp; apos ; The Big Cot &amp; apos ; , is a long-standing social club in the area . Coalshaw Green is also the location of South Chadderton Metrolink station . Archaically known as Coldshaw or Cauleshaw , Coalshaw Green is mentioned in the earliest recorded accounts of the township of Chadderton dating back to 1220 . Coalshaw Green was also mentioned in 1672 when the right of way through &amp; apos ; Coleshaw Lane &amp; apos ; was recognised on payment of a half penny a year . The growth of the nearby village of Hollinwood along the common border of Oldham and Chadderton townships saw development take place along Drury Lane and by the mid 1840s Coalshaw Green had been effectively absorbed into the village .
&amp; apos ; Hollinwood , Lancs &amp; apos ; was the area &amp; apos ; s postal address from the late 19th century until the advent of the modern postcode system , when &amp; apos ; Chadderton , Oldham &amp; apos ; became the official address . The late 19th century saw the area expand into a cotton mill district with the construction of the Gordon Mill ( 1884 ) , Rose Mill ( 1885 ) and the Asia Mill ( 1904 ) all within the vicinity ( see List of mills in Chadderton ) .
All of these mills have now been demolished .
The Rose Mill was destroyed by a major fire in 2007 .
Coalshaw Green Road , the main thoroughfare through the area , was constructed during this late 19th century period connecting the area to the nearby settlement of Butler Green / Washbrook . Turf Lane ( mentioned in records dating back to the mid 17th century ) was originally called Tarve Lane and took its name from its use .
It was a lane used by tenants to collect turf or peat for themselves and their manorial overlords .
The inhabitants had certain rights of &amp; apos ; turbary &amp; apos ; but were required to all use the same road so that they could be supervised in this operation .
The turf would be gathered from the Hale Moss area around Whitegate . Now closed , Drury Lane Council School served the area between 1894 and 1954 . In December 1908 , Chadderton Urban District Council were informed that Miss Marjorie Lees of Werneth Park , Oldham , was offering to give them £ 3,113 wherewith to purchase a plot of land from the Trustees of C .
E .
Lees , her late father .
This would be a memorial in his honour .
The Council , in accepting the gift on behalf of the inhabitants of Chadderton , gave their &amp; apos ; sincere and hearty thanks … for her most generous offer . &amp; apos ; The land , comprising about 11 acres &amp; # 91 ; 4 . 5 hectares &amp; # 93 ; lay between the Werneth to Hollinwood railway line and Coalshaw Green Road , and ran from Stanley Road to the now-demolished Rose Mill .
It was to be used as a recreation ground for children and adults for all time , with &amp; apos ; no tipping of refuse to take place there . &amp; apos ; The park was officially opened by Miss Lees , using a gold key , on 25 May 1912 in the presence of Councillor Joseph Hilton , Chairman of the Urban District Council , and other dignitaries .
Before the ceremony , a large procession led by Chadderton Brass Band , made its way from Stanley Road School through streets bedecked with flags .
Coalshaw Green , the first public recreation ground in Chadderton , was totally renovated in 1998 , and was the first of the town &amp; apos ; s three major parks to receive a Green Flag award .
Much of its redevelopment in recent years has been due to the enthusiasm of Barbara Wilson MBE , and her dedicated group of &amp; apos ; Friends &amp; apos ; of the park . March 2015 saw the opening of a skate park in Coalshaw Green Park .
Built at a cost of almost £ 160,000 , the skatepark is open to skateboarders , scooters , cyclists and roller skaters and is accessible by able-bodied and disabled skaters .
Further improvements including the provision of new tennis and basketball courts were announced in June 2016 . In July 2016 it was announced that the former Rose Mill site was , subject to planning , to be developed for housing .
The proposed development , however , ran into local opposition as the site included the Coalshaw Green playing fields .
The fields , which adjoined Coalshaw Green Park , had been in continuous use by amateur and school football teams for generations and was considered to be one of the best playing surfaces in the area . The plans for the 124 property development were subsequently approved by Oldham Council . Now closed , the church was founded in 1910 .
It was a daughter church of the extensive parish of Christ Church , Block Lane .
The church building , which had been empty and unused for a number of years , was demolished in May 2017 .
The congregation now meet at its daughter church , St Georges Chapel , at nearby Whitegate . The church was established in 1887 by outreach workers from Failsworth Wesleyan Methodist Church to serve the rapidly expanding area of Turf Lane and Coalshaw Green .
The church remained active until 1966 when it merged with a number of other local churches to form South Chadderton Methodist Church , located at Butler Green .

West BreifneThe Kingdom of West Breifne ( Irish &amp; quot ; Breifne Ua Ruairc &amp; quot ; ) or Breifne O &amp; apos ; Rourke was an historic kingdom of Ireland that existed from 1256 to 1605 , located in the area that is now County Leitrim .
It took its present boundaries in 1583 when West Breifne was shired and renamed Leitrim , after the village of Leitrim , which was an O &amp; apos ; Rourke stronghold .
The kingdom came into existence after a battle between the ruling O &amp; apos ; Rourke clan and the ascendant O &amp; apos ; Reillys caused the breakup of the older Kingdom of Breifne and led to the formation of East Breifne and West Breifne .
The kingdom was ruled by the O &amp; apos ; Rourke clan and lasted until the early 17th century , when their lands were confiscated by England . In 1172 , Tighearnán Ua Ruairc , the longtime Lord of Breifne and Conmaice , was betrayed and killed at Tlachtgha during negotiations with Hugh de Lacy , Lord of Meath .
Tighearnán was beheaded , and his head and body was conveyed to the Anglo-Normans in Dublin , where it was put on display .
The assassination of Tighernán caused a war of succession in Breifne and for the next hundred years there would be no long standing King of Breifne , as rival branches of the O &amp; apos ; Rourke clan fought for the kingship .
This time of turbulence in the kingdom caused a great rift between the various branches of clan O &amp; apos ; Rourke , with regular fighting between rival members .
The instability and weakness of Breifne , which had already lost much of its territory during the Norman invasion , prompted the O &amp; apos ; Reilly in the east of the kingdom to launch a campaign against the ruling O &amp; apos ; Rourke dynasty .
By the late 1230s the O &amp; apos ; Reilly had usurped control of Breifne , Cathal O &amp; apos ; Reilly ruled as king from the east of the kingdom and Cúchonnacht O &amp; apos ; Reilly , Connacht &amp; apos ; s foremost general and close ally of King Felim O &amp; apos ; Conor , had militarily taken control of western Breifne and expelled the O &amp; apos ; Rourke leaders . The turbulent decades that followed saw the O &amp; apos ; Reilly switch allegiance to the Norman de Burghs and the O &amp; apos ; Rourke were once again allied to Connacht .
By 1250 the O &amp; apos ; Reilly had been pushed back out of western Breifne as Connacht advanced into their eastern homeland .
In 1256 the devastating Battle of Magh Slecht was fought between Connacht and the O &amp; apos ; Rourke clan against the O &amp; apos ; Reilly .
Despite ending in an O &amp; apos ; Rourke victory , they had lost complete control over the eastern half of their kingdom and the immediate chaos that ensued within West Breifne following the war left them without the power to retake it .
As a result , Breifne was left permanently divided into East Breifne ( O &amp; apos ; Reilly ) and West Breifne ( O &amp; apos ; Rourke ) . After successfully repelling de Burgh and the O &amp; apos ; Reilly , the kings of Connacht , Tír Eoghain and Tír Chonaill met at Caoluisce Castle to agree to form a united front against the Normans in the future .
At these talks , which the O &amp; apos ; Rourke lords of Breifne were excluded from , it was agreed that the king of Connacht was the rightful ruler of all of Breifne &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; from Kells to Drumcliff &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
Consequently , Aedh O &amp; apos ; Conor saw Breifne as an integral part of Connacht rather than an independent kingdom and , as heir to the kingship , was determined to reign in its leaders .
This put Aedh in direct confrontation with Conchobar O &amp; apos ; Ruairc , king of West Breifne , who rebelled against him .
According to the Annals of Connacht , the two men &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; had been good comrades till now &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; . To assert West Breifne &amp; apos ; s independence , Conchobar made peace with the de Burghs without the permission of the king of Connacht , prompting Aedh O &amp; apos ; Conor to launch raids on West Breifne .
In 1257 , after a brief war , Conchobar submitted to O &amp; apos ; Conor and signed a peace treaty offering O &amp; apos ; Conor any lands of his choice in Breifne .
O &amp; apos ; Conor obtained the stone-castle on Cherry Island in Garadice Lough and put a garrison into it .
Later that year , Conchobar violated the terms of the treaty and forced O &amp; apos ; Conor &amp; apos ; s garrison out of the castle before razing it .
Due to this act of betrayal , Aedh O &amp; apos ; Conor elected Sitric O &amp; apos ; Ruairc to replace Conchobar as king of West Breifne , however Sitric was soon killed by Domnall , Conchobar &amp; apos ; s son , to avenge his father &amp; apos ; s dispossession .
This led to Domnall &amp; apos ; s arrest and imprisonment and Aedh O &amp; apos ; Conor resumed raids on West Breifne . This sparked a series of conflicts that lasted from 1257 to 1266 whereby Aedh O ’ Conor attempted to control the politics of West Breifne by instating and supporting his favoured candidates as kings , driving a wedge between the O ’ Rourkes , with devastating consequences for the unity and stability of the kingdom .
Amlaib was chosen to succeed Sitric , however the kingdom was in disarray and , like his predecessor , his authority as king was nominal .
His rule marks the first appearance in the annals of the king ruling “ &amp; quot ; from the mountain westward &amp; quot ; ” i . e .
west of Slieve Anieran on the eastern shore of Lough Allen – a situation that was to be repeated in the 15th century .
Art O ’ Ruairc , son of Cathal Riabach ( King of Breifne , 1231 – 1236 ) , ruled the east in opposition to Amlaib and Connacht . In 1258 , with the war against Connacht still ongoing , Conchobar was betrayed and murdered by his own men with the assistance of Matha O &amp; apos ; Reilly , king of East Breifne , who had also risen up in rebellion against Aedh O &amp; apos ; Conor .
After his father &amp; apos ; s death , Domnall was released from prison and instated as king of West Breifne .
However , shortly after his appointment as king , Domnall killed Magrath Mac Tiernan , chieftain of Tellach-Dunchada , which was a clan that held land within Breifne .
As a result of this killing , Domnall was deposed as king by the major clans of West Breifne , including Tellach-Dunchada , who executed Domnall &amp; apos ; s brother Cathal in retaliation . After Domnall was deposed , Art O &amp; apos ; Ruairc was supported by the major clans as the effective ruler of the entire kingdom , but in 1259 , he was taken prisoner by Connacht .
Connacht continued to vie for control of Breifne and supported Art bec , Amlaib ’ s brother , as king in 1260 .
Evidently a rift emerged between the two as Aedh O &amp; apos ; Conor killed Art bec , his own candidate for the kingship , that same year and met with Domnall .
After peace between the two kingdoms was agreed , kingship was returned to Domnall .
However , this peace was to be short lived , in 1260 the Tellach-Dunchada killed Domnall and in 1261 Art O &amp; apos ; Ruairc escaped from imprisonment and was made king by the chieftains of Breifne upon his return .
An attempt by Connacht to depose Art O &amp; apos ; Ruairc and regain control of Breifne in 1261 failed when their army was defeated at Drumlahan by the O &amp; apos ; Reilly and forced to retreat . The conflict between Connacht and West Breifne ended in 1266 , when Aedh O &amp; apos ; Conor , now King of Connacht , launched a successful invasion of the kingdom and deposed Art O &amp; apos ; Ruairc , instating Conchobar buide , son of King Amlaíb ( 1257 – 1258 ) , as the new king .
Aedh O &amp; apos ; Conor also took hostages from all the major clans of the kingdom .
The O &amp; apos ; Rourke rebellion against Connacht &amp; apos ; s dominance was ultimately a failure , but the O &amp; apos ; Reilly of East Breifne had succeeded in theirs and Connacht never regained control of the east . Conchobar buide reigned with the support of the king of Connacht until his death in 1273 .
He was succeeded by Tigernan , grandson of Ualgarg Ó Ruairc ( King of Breifne , 1210 – 1231 ) , who died just one year after his inauguration .
Following Tigernan ’ s death , Art O &amp; apos ; Ruairc would again become king in 1275 and reigned only for a short time before being killed in battle against the Normans near Granard and was succeeded by his son , Amlaib who reigned until 1307 , when he was killed in battle against the MacSamhradhain of Tullyhaw . Domnall Carrach , Conchobar buide ’ s brother , was inaugurated in 1307 and although he only ruled for four years until his death in 1311 , his reign , but particularly that of his son Ualgarg Mór , marked the beginning of dynasty that would last for the rest of the kingdom ’ s history .
Ualgarg Mór reigned for thirty years from 1316 to 1346 and restored power and prestige to West Breifne and the Ó Ruairc dynasty , which had been in decline for over a century and was under attack from almost all sides .
He was inaugurated in 1316 with the support of King Fedlim of Connacht and fought alongside Fedlim in the Second Battle of Athenry that year .
Following Fedlim &amp; apos ; s death at Athenry , Connacht descended into chaos as numerous contenders for its kingship emerged .
In 1318 Ualgarg Mór forged an alliance with Maelruanaid Mac Diarmata , King of Moylurg , to support Fedlim &amp; apos ; s son Toirdelbach as king of Connacht .
This was in competition to Domnall O &amp; apos ; Conor of Clan Muircheartaigh Uí Conchobhair , who were at war with the Ó Ruaircs and were occupying large parts of West Breifne . Clan Muircheartaigh arrived in West Breifne in the 1280s and by the time of Ualgarg Mór had assimilated into the kingdom .
Their chief Aedh Breifnach , as his name would suggest , was born and raised in Breifne and they had found staunch allies in Clan Mac Tiernan of Teallach Dunchadha .
They operated from their power base in West Breifne with the ultimate goal of re-establishing themselves as kings of Connacht , but for decades attempted to exercise control over all of Breifne ( East and West ) and were met with fierce resistance .
After decades of conflict , Ualgarg Mór drove Clan Muircheartaigh out of Breifne in 1343 .
While in Calry , Sligo in 1346 , battle unexpectedly erupted during which Ualgarg Mór was killed by Maelruanaid Mac Donnchada .
His dominance over the kingdom and his many children helped establish his line as the rulers of West Breifne for the rest of its history .
He was succeeded by his brother Flaithbheartach who ruled for 3 years before being overthrown by Ualgarg Mór &amp; apos ; s son Aodh bán .
Aodh bán killed Aedh mac Aedh Breifneach , chief of Clan Muircheartaigh and briefly the king of Connacht , in battle in 1350 . Cathal , Aedh mac Aedh Breifneach &amp; apos ; s brother , killed Aodh bán in 1352 and re-instated Flaithbheartach as king , Clan Muircheartaigh &amp; apos ; s influence in West Breifne had returned .
However Flaithbheartach died a few months into his reign and another of Ualgarg Mór &amp; apos ; s sons , Tadgh na gCaor , was made king .
Under Tadgh na gCaor &amp; apos ; s leadership , Clan Muircheartaigh were finally driven out of Breifne in 1370 with the help of the O &amp; apos ; Reilly , O &amp; apos ; Farrell , Mac Raghnaill and Maguires .
They sought refuge in MacWilliam Burke and never returned to West Breifne .
Tadgh na gCaor and his followers settled in Cenel Luacháin , an area in the modern barony of Carrigallen that included some parishes in western County Cavan .
He ruled from there until his death in 1376 and his younger brother Tigernán Mór succeeded him .
Tadgh na gCoar &amp; apos ; s descendants became the O &amp; apos ; Rourke &amp; apos ; s of Carrigallen . Tigernán Mór reigned for 42 years from his power base at Dromahair .
The later years of his reign were marked by a deepening rift between the various branches of the O &amp; apos ; Rourke sept .
He died of natural causes at an old age in his stronghold at Dromahair on St .
Brigid &amp; apos ; s Day .
Art , son of Tadhg na gCaor , and the head of the Carrigallen O &amp; apos ; Rourkes raised an army to vie for kingship but it was eventually passed to Tigernán Mór &amp; apos ; s son Aodh buidhe .
Aodh buidhe ruled from his father &amp; apos ; s castle for a year and half until his unexpected death in 1419 following an anomalously hot Autumn .
His brother Tadhg was chosen to succeed him , but Art proclaimed himself king and was elected by his supporters .
The stage had been set for the wars of succession which were to characterise the politics of West Breifne for the next century . For much of its history , West Breifne saw disputes over kingship , with persistent battles between rival factions .
As a result of factions consolidating power in their home regions , three distinct branches of royalty emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries , named after the areas in which they were based .
All three branches trace their lineage back to King Ualgarg mór ( 1316 – 1346 ) .
The O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Dromahair were the main line of kings .
The term &amp; quot ; O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Dromahair &amp; quot ; only came into use after King Tigernán óg ( 1449 – 1468 ) , and refers to those based in the capital Dromahair in the west of the kingdom .
The O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Carrigallen were descendant from Tadgh na gCoar , Ualgarg mór &amp; apos ; s son , who reigned from 1352 to 1376 .
Due to their strategic location east of Lough Allen and the Iron Mountains , they twice divided the kingdom along east / west lines .
The third branch , the O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Carha , based in the northwest , emerged in the mid 15th century with the crowning of King Donnchadh , great-grandson of Ualgarg mór .
The kingship of West Breifne during this volatile period largely depended upon the often capricious support of the other clans within the kingdom and the surrounding area , notably the MacSamhradhain , Mac Raghnaill and Tellach-Dunchada . The most significant of the rivalries was between the O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Dromahair , those based in the capital , and the O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Carrigallen .
This rivalry would see the kingdom split between &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; East Breifne O &amp; apos ; Rourke &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( North Leitrim ) and &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; West Breifne O &amp; apos ; Rourke &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( South Leitrim ) at least twice .
The first from 1419 to 1424 , following the death of King Aedh buidhe .
Aedh &amp; apos ; s brother , Tadhg , was chosen to succeed his brother as King , however in southern Leitrim , Art O &amp; apos ; Rourke , son of King Tadgh na gcoar ( 1352 – 1376 ) , was elected king with the support of the Tellach Dunchada , the Mac Raghnaill .
At his inauguration , Tadhg had declared himself &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; king of all Breifne &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; and as a result Eoghan O &amp; apos ; Reilly , king of East Breifne , threw his support behind Art O &amp; apos ; Rourke and moved soldiers into Carrigallen .
Beset with problems back home just months later , the O &amp; apos ; Reilly withdrew support for Art and his rebellion collapsed .
West Breifne was more or less completely under the control of Tadhg by the end of 1420 and Art was in exile , however it would take until 1424 for Art to finally submit to Tadhg . The second split occurred after King Tadhg &amp; apos ; s death in 1435 .
King Tadhg was to be succeeded by his brother Donnchadh bacagh .
However , Art O &amp; apos ; Rourke &amp; apos ; s brother , Lochlainn Ó Ruairc , was declared &amp; quot ; King of East Breifne O &amp; apos ; Rourke &amp; quot ; and the kingdom was again divided .
Donnchadh bacagh died in 1445 and his nephew Donnchadh , the first of the Carha line , was elected to take his place and ruled until his death in 1449 .
He was succeeded by his cousin Tigernan óg .
The two kingdoms were in a perpetual state of war that would last for 23 years until 1458 , when East Breifne O &amp; apos ; Rourke was invaded by the Maguires of Fermanagh , Lochlainn Ó Ruairc , now 80 years old , was defeated and the kingship of East Breifne O &amp; apos ; Rourke was dissolved .
Tigernán óg became king of a united West Breifne . Following the death of King Tigernán óg in 1468 , kingship was again in dispute , this time between Domnall , Tigernán óg &amp; apos ; s brother , and Donnchadh losc , Tigernán óg &amp; apos ; s uncle .
Domnall was supported by the O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Dromahair and Ruadh O &amp; apos ; Donnell , the Lord of Tír Chonaill .
Donnchadh losc received support from the O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Carha as well as the people of Carbury and the Clann-Donough .
In 1470 , Domnall and O &amp; apos ; Donnell led an army to &amp; quot ; Cruachan &amp; quot ; , the traditional inauguration site of kings , in an attempt to inaugurate Domnall , however they were stopped at Ballyconnell by the O &amp; apos ; Reilly .
This dispute caused infighting within West Breifne and left a deepened rivalry between the O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Dromahair and the O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Carha .
The dispute ended in a victory for the O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Carha and their allies , who elected King Feidhlimidh mac Donnchadha in 1476 .
He ruled from his stronghold of Castle Carha for 24 contentious years . In 1488 , Eóghan , son of Tigernán óg ( 1449 – 1468 ) , killed King Feidhlimidh mac Donnchadha &amp; apos ; s son , also called Eoghan .
Following the death of Feidhlimidh mac Donnchadha in 1500 , Eóghan became king .
After Eóghan &amp; apos ; s death in 1528 , Feidhlimidh , another son of King Feidhlimidh mac Donnchadha , claimed the throne and ruled from Castle Carha , in contention with Brian Ballach , son of Eóghan .
In 1536 Brian Ballach laid siege to Caste Carha and demolished it , re-establishing Dromahair &amp; apos ; s dominion over the entire kingdom .
Feidhlimidh was deposed and died that same year as a prisoner of Brian Ballach . The rivalry between these branches ultimately ended in victory for the O ’ Rourkes of Dromahair and a return to stability in the succession of kings in the 1530s .
Following the defeat of Lochlainn Ó Ruairc of Carrigallen in 1458 and the dissolution of his kingdom , the Carrigallen O ’ Rourkes ceased to rule over Breifne ever again .
The O ’ Rourkes of Carha were wholly crushed by Dromahair in 1536 when Brian Ballach consolidated power over the entire kingdom .
These regional conflicts over succession never re-emerged following this due to the changing political landscape in Ireland , as English influence grew in the latter half of the 16th century and the clans united to fight against their encroachments . Following a period of relative calm , a brief power struggle between the sons of Brian Ballach ensued in the 1560s .
Between 1564 and 1566 both Aodh Gallda and Aodh Buidhe were murdered by groups intent on getting Brian na Murtha crowned king .
According to the annals , Aodh Gallda was murdered in Leitrim &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; by his own people &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
The murder of Aodh Buidhe was carried out by the vassals of Tyrconnell in Sligo , as Lord Manus O &amp; apos ; Donnell &amp; apos ; s daughter was Brian na Murtha &amp; apos ; s mother .
Following Aodh Buidhe &amp; apos ; s death , Brian na Murtha was elected king ( or lord ) of West Breifne in 1566 . The expansion of English power in Ireland arrived in West Breifne when Brian Ballach entered an agreement with the English in 1542 .
Under the terms of this agreement the O &amp; apos ; Rourke king was to keep his authority and traditional rights over the other clans of West Breifne , the sitting O &amp; apos ; Rourke king was also to be granted the peerage title &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Viscount Dromahaire &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; and pay a tribute to the crown , however the terms of this treaty were never realized as the English failed to uphold them . Lord Deputy John Perrot &amp; apos ; s unilateral declaration of the legal establishment of County Leitrim in 1565 heralded the first breach of this treaty .
After coming to power , Brian na Múrtha Ó Ruairc was knighted by the English in 1567 , but came into conflict with them due to the pernicious expansion of their authorities in Ireland .
In 1569 West Breifne was subsumed into the Presidency of Connaught , an English government jurisdiction .
This governorate was not recognised by the kings and chiefs of Connacht and the first Lord President of Connaught , Sir Edward Fitton , wielded virtually no power over the area .
Gradually , many of the Irish kings began to tentatively work with the English ( often through coercion ) , including Brian na Múrtha , who agreed to submit to the first composition of Connacht in 1576 .
These later submissions bore no resemblance to those agreed by Brian Ballach .
Under the 1576 agreement the king of West Breifne was to answer to the Presidency-appointed High Sheriff of Leitrim , was denied the authority to rule over the other clans and , most crucially , was not allowed to maintain gallowglass . Nicholas Malby , second Lord President of Connaught , and Brian na Múrtha had a strained relationship .
Malby disparagingly referred to Brian na Múrtha as &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; a nobody . . . undeserving of his reputation &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; and remarked that he was &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; the proudest man this day living on the earth &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
Upon receiving reports that West Breifne was harbouring coyners and mercenaries , Malby ordered one of his officers to attack the kingdom in April 1578 .
They captured Leitrim castle , looted it and killed its occupants .
This was the first time Tudor soldiers attacked West Breifne and was more about sending a message to Ó Ruairc that his kingdom was not impervious to English power , than about tackling coyners .
Following the attack , Ó Ruairc sent his son Brian Óg na Samhtach to Dublin to complain on his behalf to Lord Deputy Henry Sidney of harassment by Malby and the Presidency .
With Ó Ruairc humbled , Malby agreed to return Leitrim castle to him . In turn , lands within Connaught were attacked by Ó Ruairc in 1580 , illustrating the weakness of the agreement , which collapsed following Malby &amp; apos ; s death in 1581 .
Ó Ruairc now viewed both the Lord President of Connaught and the Lord Deputy of Ireland as hostile and from 1578 onwards he ordered the systematic destruction of several castles across the kingdom , including those at Leitrim , Dromahair and Ducarrick out of fear that the English would occupy them . As part of the policy of surrender and regrant , Ó Ruairc surrendered his lordship on 2 June 1585 at the parliament in Dublin but was never re-granted lordship of County Leitrim , which took its present boundaries in 1583 .
He was a signatory of the Second Composition of Connaught in 1585 , but resisted the appointment of a High Sheriff of Leitrim , and refused to pay rent on large tracts of land .
He regarded his agreements with the presidency as non-binding and his relationship with England remained tense .
As such , West Breifne existed in a state of semi-autonomy , as both its king and the English regularly signed agreements and failed to live up to those agreements . Brian na Múrtha was particularly weary of the implementation of English Law over Brehon Law in West Breifne as this would disqualify his favoured son , Brian Óg na Samhtach , an illegitimate child by Annably O ’ Crean , wife of a Sligo merchant , from inheriting his title .
Under English Law it would pass to his eldest legitimate son , Tadhg O ’ Rourke , who was only 8 years old in 1585 and living with his mother Mary Bourke , sister of the Earl of Clanricarde and Brian na Murtha ’ s estranged lawful wife . The already bad relations between Brian na Múrtha and the presidency worsened during the rule of Lord President Sir Richard Bingham .
Bingham and Ó Ruairc harboured a deep resentment of one another .
Ó Ruairc , who Bingham referred to as a &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; proud beggar &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; commanded his forces to attack those of the presidency to halt their excursions into West Breifne , which had become commonplace by this stage , and to end Bingham &amp; apos ; s incessant harassment of his countrymen .
During the Anglo-Spanish War ( 1585 – 1604 ) , Brian na Múrtha assisted at least eighty survivors of the Spanish Armada shipwreck off the Sligo coast to depart the country in the winter of 1588 .
Among the survivors was Captain Francisco de Cuellar , who kept a detailed account of the events and was hosted in Ó Ruairc &amp; apos ; s castle at Lough Gill .
His aid to the Spanish would later be used against him in his trial for high treason . In peace talks in 1589 , following West Breifne ’ s brief war against the Presidency in April of that year , Ó Ruairc did accept the terms of a crown tribute , but resisted the new composition terms of 1585 and refused to allow the formation of a crown administration in the new County Leitrim .
Instead of submitting to the presidency &amp; apos ; s authority , he sought what effectively amounted to full autonomy from the Kingdom of Ireland in Dublin .
However , in the wake of the Spanish landings in Ireland , and due to West Breifne ’ s strategic location between Connacht and Ulster and its pre-existing reputation as a rebellious kingdom , Lord Deputy William Fitzwilliam – who was already aggressively trying to curb the powers of the gaelic leadership , even those who had sworn loyalty to the crown – commanded Bingham to invade West Breifne .
Bingham and his ally Donogh O &amp; apos ; Brien , 4th Earl of Thomond , invaded the territory in January 1590 and had forced Ó Ruairc to flee by March . He was given refuge by Eoghan Óg , Chief of Mac Suibhne na d ’ Tuath , and stayed in his castle on the western shores of Tyrconnell for a year . He travelled to Scotland in February 1591 bearing gifts ( including four Irish Wolfhounds ) , in anticipation of a meeting with King James VI , seeking to raise an army of mercenaries and retake his kingdom .
In consultation with the English ambassador , King James VI denied him audience and was pressured by Queen Elizabeth I to arrest him and deliver him to England , citing the agreements made in the Treaty of Berwick .
After much debate and controversy , Ó Ruairc was arrested in Glasgow on 3 April 1591 and delivered into English custody .
He was kept at the Tower of London and was put on trial and asked to pledge to the crown , accepting all prior agreements , and to denounce his Catholic faith .
In response he refused to recognise the authority of the court or Elizabeth and did not plead mercy .
On charges that he failed to show proper &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; reverence &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; to the Queen when he allegedly dragged a portrait of her through the mud and then tore it apart , he responded that there was &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; a great difference between images of your Queen and those of saints &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
He was hanged , drawn and quartered for high treason on 3 November 1591 . News of Brian na Múrtha &amp; apos ; s death was met with shock back in Ireland , the annals describing it as &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; one of the mournful stories of the Irish &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
Brian Óg na Samhtach O &amp; apos ; Rourke , his son and chief lieutenant during the war against Connaught , was also in exile following Bingham ’ s occupation of West Breifne .
The other clans in the kingdom who had fought with Brian na Murtha unconditionally surrendered to Bingham in Athlone shortly after his exile , leaving Brian Óg with little support .
Bingham described O ’ Rourke and his remaining followers as “ &amp; quot ; 80 beggarly traitors &amp; quot ; ” . He was however , supported by the O ’ Donnells and Maguires in neighboring Tyrconnell , where he was living in exile and , with the tacit support of Tyrconnell , carrying out guerilla attacks on West Breifne from 1590 to 1592 .
On 3 April 1592 he wrote to the Privy Council of Ireland unsuccessfully pleading with them to pardon him of any wrongdoing during the war in 1589 , stating “ &amp; quot ; I did nothing but what my father advised or commanded me to do &amp; quot ; ” .
The Gaelic lords of Ulster ; Hugh O ’ Donnell , Hugh Maguire and later Hugh O ’ Neill , arguably the most powerful in all of Ireland , were forming something of a makeshift defensive alliance at this time , laying the foundations for the Alliance of Irish Clans which fought in the Nine Years &amp; apos ; War . They saw Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam ’ s execution of Lord MacMahon and the division of his kingdom ( modern day County Monaghan ) into nine parts – amongst eight “ loyal ” clans and the Barony of Farney which was given to the Earl of Essex – and now the deputy &amp; apos ; s occupation of West Breifne , as a step too far .
The expansionist forces of Fitzwilliam now extended the entire southern border of their kingdoms from Leitrim to Louth – the Tudor Conquest had reached Ulster .
Throughout 1591 and 1592 , Fitzwilliam and Bingham had drawn up plans for the full annexation of West Breifne into the control of the Kingdom of Ireland , but were forced to abandon these plans and withdraw due to the volatility of the region .
This allowed Brian Óg to return to the kingdom and stake his claim as king . Edmund McGuaran , a prominent Bishop from Tullyhaw in Breifne territory was instrumental in the formation of the Irish alliance .
He spent much of the 1580s in Madrid , persuading King Phillip II of Spain to support the Gaelic kingdoms militarily , framing the conflict between them and England as a defence of Catholicism .
O ’ Neill , O ’ Donnell and O ’ Rourke would all pledge their allegiance to the Spanish king in 1595 .
O ’ Rourke promised to be &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; a most faithful and obedient servant &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; of Phillip II .
Were it not for England &amp; apos ; s desperation to see peace return to Ireland following the war , this would have surely seen them executed for treason .
McGuaran travelled to Rome and was made Archbishop of Armagh , Primate of All Ireland in July 1587 before returning to Ireland by 1592 . Sir George Bingham , brother of Richard and High Sheriff of Sligo based in Ballymote , and Brian Óg O ’ Rourke carried out the first acts of what was to become the Nine Years &amp; apos ; War .
George Bingham led an expedition into West Breifne and seized O ’ Rourke ’ s milch cows in lieu of unpaid rent .
O ’ Rourke responded by hiring an army of mercenaries from Tyrconnell , Tyrone and Fermanagh , and set out with 1,100 men to Sligo in May 1593 and “ &amp; quot ; there was little of that country which he did not plunder &amp; quot ; ” – razing 13 villages and ransacking Ballymote itself .
This was quickly followed by another excursion into Connaught , this time by Hugh Maguire who routed Sir Richard Bingham ’ s forces near Tulsk , County Roscommon .
In the wake of these two consecutive defeats in May and June , Fitzwilliam offered Maguire and O ’ Rourke a white peace if Maguire disbanded the army he had assembled .
His acceptance of this became the first of a number of ceasefires that characterized the Nine Years &amp; apos ; War , where both England and the Irish lords had no intention of making peace but rather used the time to recover and regroup forces . In September Maguire restarted his campaign and raided Monaghan , but by February 1594 Hugh Maguire , Brian Óg ’ s primary patron , had lost Enniskillen and was on the brink of defeat .
The possibility of Maguire ’ s collapse , leaving the English on his doorstep , prompted Hugh Roe O ’ Donnell to intervene and by June 1594 the tide of war had turned again , they had retaken Enniskillen and soundly defeated the English army at Bel-Atha-na-mBriosgaidh , forcing them to retreat over the Arney River back into Cavan .
Brian Óg himself spent 1594 in West Breifne and the northwest of Ireland , writing letters to other lords trying to convince them to join the war against England . By 1595 O ’ Donnell was firmly in control of West Breifne .
O ’ Rourke , although allied to him , was completely dependent upon him .
The kingdom was devastated after over a decade of intermittent war and O ’ Rourke was unable to raise soldiers himself and was given little of the spoils of war that O ’ Donnell and O ’ Neill had reaped .
Many of the clans of West Breifne who had sworn loyalty to the English allied themselves with O ’ Donnell .
The kingdom was frequently used as the route through which the Irish forces would travel to raid Connaught , before being used as a staging ground by O ’ Donnell to attack Annaly , Longford and Cavan .
In June 1595 Sligo castle fell to O ’ Donnell and Sir George Bingham was killed .
By 1596 West Breifne was part of what Richard Bingham termed “ &amp; quot ; O ’ Donnell ’ s Commonwealth &amp; quot ; ” which , along with Tyrconnell itself , now included Leitrim , Sligo , Mayo and Northern Roscommon – all territories that were firmly under Bingham ’ s control just 3 years prior . Bingham was relieved of his command and replaced by Sir Conyers Clifford in 1597 , by which time O ’ Donnell had completely pushed the English out of Connacht .
Despite early setbacks , by October 1597 the English were back in control of Connacht , due to the changing allegiance of the O ’ Conors of Sligo and the Burkes of Galway who turned on O ’ Donnell ’ s allied lords in Connacht and forced them to retreat .
This success was a result of Clifford ’ s conciliatory approach to the Irish lords , favouring negotiation over conflict .
In a letter to William Cecil , Chief Advisor of Queen Elizabeth , Clifford declared that all of Connacht was pacified , save Brian Óg O ’ Rourke , who Clifford was trying to win over to the English side . The war had quieted down because of a truce signed between the English and rebel Irish lords in October 1597 that was set to expire in June 1598 .
In November 1597 Brian Óg , in a letter to Clifford , wrote that he would capitulate if the English were willing to guarantee the return of all of his father ’ s lands and recognize him , and not his half-brother Tadhg , as the legitimate heir under English Law and compromise on reduced taxes on those lands .
Up until now any English assurances to O ’ Rourke were meaningless , as he knew they had no power to protect him from O ’ Donnell were he to switch allegiance .
Upon receiving this offer Clifford immediately wrote to Cecil asking him to grant all of these requests .
In December , Clifford was granted full authority to make peace with O ’ Rourke “ &amp; quot ; as soon as possible &amp; quot ; ” and “ &amp; quot ; assure him his lands &amp; quot ; ” .
In February 1598 , O ’ Rourke , accompanied by thirty West Breifne nobles , travelled to Boyle and submitted to Clifford , handing over the letters he had received from Phillip II of Spain as a sign of his allegiance . O ’ Rourke ’ s fourteen demands , all of which were granted by Queen Elizabeth , included the stationing of English soldiers in his territory under his control to protect him from O ’ Neill and O ’ Donnell , a pardon for him and all his followers , a guarantee that he could not be charged or arrested by anyone , except on the orders of the Queen herself , and assurance that he would be given a pension to live on should O ’ Donnell or O ’ Neill seize his lands in retaliation .
For his part , O ’ Rourke was tasked with delivering pledges of loyalty to the crown from all the major clans of West Breifne within twenty days .
The treaty was an immense victory for O ’ Rourke .
In contrast to the situation 3 years earlier , the once desolate kingdom of West Breifne was now more prosperous than anywhere in Connacht , having recovered from the devastation wrought by Bingham and had been relatively untouched by the war in the last four years . The agreement was not to last and West Breifne switched allegiance back to the Irish Alliance shortly before the expiration of the ceasefire on 7 June 1598 .
This betrayal of the English was a pragmatic choice as O &amp; apos ; Rourke felt Clifford could not deliver on his promises .
Firstly , he feared their weakness in the face of Tyrone and Tyrconnell , the latter of which was hosting his brother Tadhg and would surely make him king over Brian Óg in the event of a war .
Lord Chancellor Adam Loftus had denied Clifford &amp; apos ; s request to provide O &amp; apos ; Rourke with a garrison of 1,200 men .
Secondly , in spite of the agreement that had been reached , O &amp; apos ; Rourke wrote to Clifford stating he had discovered that Thomas Butler , Earl of Ormonde , had assured Mary Bourke ( Tadhg &amp; apos ; s mother ) that he would support Tadhg &amp; apos ; s claim as king of West Breifne .
Clifford blamed both men for O &amp; apos ; Rourke &amp; apos ; s defection back to the rebels .
Brian Óg &amp; apos ; s fears proved correct as by early 1599 , the rebel Irish lords were in complete control of Ulster and Connacht and raiding as far south as historic Thomond , before occupying Munster and most of Leinster the following year .
The war was also placing a huge financial burden on England and by the war ’ s end the English exchequer would near bankruptcy , having spent almost £ 2 million . West Breifne ’ s most famous contribution of the war came at The Battle of Curlew Pass .
A substantial English force some 2,000-2,500 strong led by Sir Conyers Clifford were travelling north only to find that O ’ Rourke and 400 of his men had barricaded the pass and were guarding it on either side .
O ’ Rourkes forces , along with those of Hugh O ’ Donnell , who did not take part in the battle , decisively defeated the English who were forced to retreat .
Losses were minimal for the Irish and estimated to be around 500 , but possibly as high as 1,400 for the English .
Clifford was left mortally wounded and Brian Óg ordered his head to be cut off and sent to O &amp; apos ; Donnell , who in turn sent it to the besieged O &amp; apos ; Conors in Sligo as a message that no English help was coming .
O &amp; apos ; Conor surrendered shortly afterwards .
Clifford &amp; apos ; s body was honourably buried at the monastery in Lough Key and his “ &amp; quot ; tragic death … . was much lamented &amp; quot ; ” by the Irish lords , as the man had “ &amp; quot ; never told them a falsehood &amp; quot ; ” .
O ’ Rourke and O ’ Donnell were not on good terms at this time .
Brian Óg ’ s rival to the kingship , Tadhg , had married O ’ Donnell ’ s sister Mary and was staying with her in Tyrconnell .
Coeval correspondence between the English command mentions multiple disagreements between Brian Óg and Hugh Roe .
Despite this tension , their alliance persisted for the duration of the war . By late 1600 the tide of war had turned against the Irish Alliance .
The English stepped up their campaign , stationing 18,000 soldiers in Ireland on top of the thousands of Irish infantry already at their disposal , and had wrested more Irish lords from O ’ Neill and O ’ Donnell , most notably Niall Garbh , who betrayed the alliance and allowed the forces of Henry Docwra to land at Lough Foyle .
The new commander of the English forces in Ireland Charles Blount , 8th Baron Mountjoy , employed a scorched earth policy which hit the Irish civilian and military population hard .
Clandeboye , the primary breadbasket of the Ulster allies , was invaded and had its crops burnt , livestock slaughtered and villages torched , leading to a famine in Ulster which took the lives of 60,000 people in 1602-03 .
Docwra meanwhile set up a series of fortifications along the River Foyle , cutting access between Tyrone and Tyrconnell .
In the context of West Breifne they plotted to exploit the tension between Tadhg and Brian Óg O ’ Rourke .
In January 1601 Tadhg O ’ Rourke was given 800 men by O ’ Donnell to revive the rebellion in Munster , his campaign there was a disaster and he returned to Ulster in the summer having lost 500 men .
Upon his return it was announced that the brothers had reconciled . However , Brian Óg was to travel south with O ’ Donnell in December to take part in the ill-fated Battle of Kinsale and while Brian Óg was away , Tadhg had defected to the English and claimed kingship of West Breifne for himself with the support of his mother ’ s family the Burkes of Clanricarde .
Hugh Roe left Ireland for Spain following his defeat at Kinsale , leaving Rory O ’ Donnell in charge of Tyrconnell .
The English plan of bringing Irish lordships onto their side , thus dividing the alliance , had largely succeeded across the island and Brian Óg was forced to return to West Breifne and restate his authority as king by force .
After ousting Tadhg , Brian Óg was called upon by Rory O &amp; apos ; Donnell to assist him and provide him with soldiers in early 1602 but O &amp; apos ; Rourke refused and remained in West Breifne to &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; protect his people &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
The Alliance of Irish clans that was on the cusp of victory just one year earlier had disintegrated . By the end of June 1602 , Mountjoy was writing triumphant letters to Treasurer George Carey from Tyrone ’ s capital Dungannon .
By January 1603 Brian Óg , in a turn of events for the once exiled lord , now harboured the ousted lords Maguire , O ’ Sullivan and Tyrrell within his kingdom .
They wished to regroup and join up with the remaining forces of Hugh O ’ Neill but unbeknownst to them O ’ Neill had already left for Mellifont to surrender . West Breifne was now the only Irish kingdom that had not yet surrendered .
Brian Óg continued the revolt knowing that his legitimate , well-connected , loyalist half-brother Tadhg would receive his lands were he to surrender now , but the odds were stacked impossibly against him .
At the end of March 1603 the invasion of West Breifne began .
A force of 3,000 men led by Tadhg , the now-loyalist Rory O ’ Donnell and Henry Folliott , were prevented from crossing the River Shannon for twelve days by O &amp; apos ; Rourke &amp; apos ; s entrenched forces .
Eventually an English garrison broke through their defences and fortified themselves in northern Leitrim at a church in Black Pig &amp; apos ; s Dyke .
O &amp; apos ; Rourke and forces loyal to him were holed up in their keeps as the countryside of West Breifne was ravaged by attacks .
On April 25 , 1603 Mountjoy reported that Brian Óg had been toppled , forced into the forests like &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; a wood kerne &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
West Breifne &amp; apos ; s resistance was ultimately broken and Brian Óg fled . The ousted Brian Óg again sought to strike a deal with the English allowing him to keep his lands but this was flatly refused .
Finally , in September 1603 , King James I granted Sir Tadhg O ’ Rourke “ &amp; quot ; the country or lordship of Breny Ui Ruairc and Muinter Eoluis &amp; quot ; ” .
On 28 January 1604 Brian Óg died of fever in exile in Galway and was buried in the Friary of Ross Errilly . After defeat in the Nine Years &amp; apos ; War , the total implementation of English Law across Ireland was inevitable and the Gaelic political order collapsed .
Many O &amp; apos ; Rourke nobles left for mainland Europe and the clans throughout Ireland went into a steady decline culminating in The Flight of the Earls in 1607 .
The clans within West Breifne were granted land and assurances of their rights to pass on that land to their eldest son under English law in exchange for pledging loyalty to the crown , circumventing the authority of the ruling O ’ Rourke dynasty – the same form of divide and rule that was first adopted by the English government in Ireland following their occupation of MacMahon territory in 1590 .
Each of these clans held only modest estates and could not properly threaten English authority or raise armies and amass wealth through taxation like the larger Gaelic kingdoms could .
The O ’ Rourke ’ s had been relegated to large landowners within County Leitrim , with no official authority over the other clans and a vastly reduced tax base , land area and population .
The kingdom was effectively over . In late 1605 Sir Tadhg O ’ Rourke suddenly fell terminally ill and died aged 28 , rumours of his poisoning abound – especially given the extraordinary circumstances that would lead to the dispossession of his sons and the subsequent Plantations of Leitrim .
Tadhg had two sons , Brian and Aedh .
Brian was to inherit his father ’ s title and lands but as he was only 6 years old at the time , his father ’ s cousin , Richard Burke , 4th Earl of Clanricarde , was given wardship of the boys on 11 February 1606 .
Brian and his brother Aedh were to fall victim to the plotting of Attorney-General for Ireland John Davies , who set about undoing the “ &amp; quot ; distasteful settlements &amp; quot ; ” reached with the native Irish lords in the Treaty of Mellifont through legal means . His opportunity arose when questions over the legitimacy of Brian and Aedh were raised as their mother Mary was twice divorced before her marriage to Tadhg .
If these divorces were not recognised by English Law it was possible to revoke the patent of the O ’ Rourke children .
Lord Deputy Arthur Chichester was anxious to pacify the wilderness of O ’ Rourke ’ s country which was a “ &amp; quot ; den of outlaws and malefactors &amp; quot ; ” where “ &amp; quot ; no Englishmen dwell &amp; quot ; ” .
Wealthy speculators were equally as anxious to open Leitrim up to plantations . With their power over Ireland firmly established , many within the English government and legal system began a covert effort to dispossess the Irish heirs of rebellious lords – such as those who took part in the Nine Years &amp; apos ; War – and pass their land on to English and Scottish Protestant settlers .
Richard Burke protested their machinations arguing that no moves to dispossess Brian should be made until he turns twenty-one . In November 1616 Brian O ’ Rourke was ordered to England by James I .
As a knight of the English realm James felt O ’ Rourke should receive an English education in Oxford University , Burke was to pay for his tuition .
In November 1618 , while Brian was still in college and still the legal heir , the English government in Ireland led by Oliver St .
John , were surveying and “ mapping ” Leitrim for plantation .
Following an altercation in Oxford on St .
Patrick ’ s Day 1619 , O ’ Rourke was arrested and charged with battery .
He was ordered to pay an unprecedented £ 250 each to the three claimants .
Despite being known personally to James I and despite Burke agreeing to pay the court &amp; apos ; s recommended settlement of £ 50 to each claimant followed by another £ 50 within a year of O ’ Rourke ’ s release , the claimants refused and he remained in prison at Gatehouse .
Predictably , later that year a jury found that Mary O ’ Donnell ’ s divorce of her first husband Donal O ’ Cahan was void , therefore her marriage to Tadhg was not recognised and their two sons Brian and Aedh were declared illegitimate . Brian was moved to the Tower of London on unspecified charges and his situation was made worse by renewed tensions between England and Spain , who would go to war in 1625 .
The O ’ Rourke nobles who fled to Spain and were fighting in the Irish Regiment as well as West Breifne ’ s history of aiding the Spanish in Ireland was emphasized by those who benefitted from O ’ Rourke &amp; apos ; s downfall and wished to see him remain incarcerated . Lord Justice William Parsons travelled to London in February 1621 to convince George Villiers , 1st Duke of Buckingham , the king &amp; apos ; s favourite , to support the foundation of a new agency , the Irish Court of Wards , which would pave the way for new plantations in Ireland .
By supporting these plantations Villiers could ensure that he would benefit handsomely .
With no “ legitimate ” heirs and the remaining O ’ Rourke nobles in Leitrim disassociating themselves from Brian in exchange for security of their own lands , the plantations officially began in August 1621 .
Within a few weeks County Leitrim ’ s approximately 400,000 acres had been divided .
Half of the county ( 50 grants ) was given to Protestant British settlers and the other half ( 151 grants ) to the natives in a complete restructuring of the land . Brian ’ s brother Aedh was also placed in the spotlight .
Aedh was living with his mother and her fifth husband in County Mayo , but also intermittently in Leitrim .
In June 1624 Lord Deputy Henry Cary encouraged Aedh to travel to Dublin to discuss the legal situation regarding his inheritance .
Although he had been officially declared illegitimate by England , Cary feared that in the event of an invasion by Spain and a rebellion by Aedh O ’ Rourke , he would be “ &amp; quot ; exceedingly followed by the Irish &amp; quot ; ” .
Conscious of his brother ’ s situation he initially declined . He arrived in Dublin in May 1626 and impressed both Cary and the Privy Council .
Cary sent him , along with his cousin Con O ’ Donnell , heir of Tyrconnell , to London , confident that they could be convinced to relinquish their claims .
At Hampton Court , Aedh refused to give up his claim to his father ’ s lands in the barony of Dromahair , County Leitrim , which had already been settled by British plantation owners , and was jailed .
He would ’ ve met the same fate as his brother were it not for his cousin Mary Stuart O &amp; apos ; Donnell , a dissident Irish Catholic living in England who orchestrated his escape .
With her help Aedh fled to Flanders and joined the Spanish army . Brian meanwhile continued to languish in prison , writing to Charles I and other English officials , petitioning them for a speedy trial so he could face his accusers , secure his freedom and recover his land .
Ignorant of what had transpired in Leitrim in his absence , he also wrote to Chief Minister George Villiers , who had been given 4,500 acres of O ’ Rourke ’ s estate , pleading for a trial which he never received .
He died in the Tower of London in December 1641 , having spent 22 of his 42-year life in prison . The last legacy of the Dromahair O ’ Rourke lords during the plantations was the land allocated to their widows .
Mary O ’ Donnell , mother of Brian and Aedh and widow of King Tadhg ( 1603 – 1605 ) was granted 1,600 acres and Mary Maguire , widow of King Brian Óg ( 1591 – 1603 ) was granted 700 .
Tiernan , grandson of King Feidhlimidh ( 1528 – 1536 ) the last of the Carha line , was granted land in the Barony of Rosclogher in 1622 and in 1629 Shane Óg , descendant of the Carrigallen O &amp; apos ; Rourkes , received 1,800 acres in Carrigallen .
Three other natives of former West Breifne ; Elizabeth Duff , Catherine Glanchy and Mary Crofton were granted 4,000 acres between them .
The largest landowner was Scottish noble Frederick Hamilton , who founded Manorhamilton on the banks of the Owenbeg River .
He received 6,500 acres but would later grow this to over 18,000 acres . Many stately homes and large castles such as Parke &amp; apos ; s Castle , Manorhamilton Castle and Lough Rynn Castle were built by British Protestant settlers during the plantations .
By 1641 , 63 . 5 % of County Leitrim was owned by Protestants and 31 . 1 % was owned by Catholics , with 5 . 3 % not surveyed .
Following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland from 1649 to 1653 and the subsequent Down Survey of 1656 – 1658 , a nationwide survey which measured the land which was to be forfeited by the native Irish , the land held by settlers would increase even further .
By 1670 the land held by Catholics in Leitrim had fallen to 8 % , with 86 . 3 % held by Protestants and 5 . 6 % not surveyed . A topographical poem written by John Ó Dubhagain and Giolla na naomh Ó Huidhrin in the 14th century outlines the major clans that inhabited the Breifne region ( both East and West ) at that time .
Other sources that document the clans within Breifne are &amp; quot ; Onomasticon Goedelicum &amp; quot ; , compiled by Edmund Hogan in 1910 and the multitude of references to various clans and their locations that exist in the Irish annals .
This list documents those clans that inhabited West Breifne , which was colloquially referred to as Breifne O &amp; apos ; Rourke as they were the overlords of the kingdom , but numerous other clans that held distinct territories were also present .
For most of its history West Breifne &amp; apos ; s territory contained the Cavan baronies of Tullyhaw and Tullyhunco , as well as a small portion of County Sligo .
Therefore , the clans in these areas were part of the kingdom , but their territories are no longer contained within County Leitrim , which is roughly based off the boundaries West Breifne had when the county was created in 1583 . The following is a list of the kings of West Breifne , an Irish kingdom situated in modern County Leitrim . &amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ; &amp; quot ; Dromahair &amp; quot ; in &amp; quot ; italics &amp; quot ; denotes post Ualgarg mor kings who ruled from the capital Dromahair before the term &amp; quot ; O &amp; apos ; Rourkes of Dromahair &amp; quot ; was in use .

Born in the 1650s , son of Eóghan mór son of Tighearnán bán son of Eoghan son of King Brian Ballach O &amp; apos ; Rourke . Chief from 1666 until his death sometime later .
Born in 1772 in Estonia , the Count O &amp; apos ; Rourke of Russia .
He was a male-line descendant of King Lochlann O &amp; apos ; Rourke . Chief from about 1800 until March 10 , 1849 when he died in Belarus .
Born in January , 1943 .
He is the direct male-line descendant of Eóghan Óg Ó Ruairc . Chief from 1994 to the present-day .

2014 Women &amp; apos ; s Ice Hockey World ChampionshipsThe 2014 Women &amp; apos ; s World Ice Hockey Championships was the 16th such event hosted by the International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) .
This was the first time that the women &amp; apos ; s tournaments were played in an Olympic year .
The IIHF determined that the best way to continue advancing the competitive level of nations not invited to the Olympic tournament was to fund participation every year .
No top level tournament was played , and initially the IIHF stated that the last placed Olympic participant would be relegated to be replaced by the Division I A winner .
However after discussion it was changed so that the two teams in question played best of three series instead of simply swapping places . The last-placed team of the Olympics faced the winner of this year &amp; apos ; s Division I A tournament in a best-of-three series .
The winner was promoted to the 2015 Top Division .
The games took place on 8 – 11 November 2014 in Yokohama , Japan . The Division I A tournament was played in Přerov , Czech Republic , from 6 to 12 April 2014 .

Octave BoudouardOctave Leopold Boudouard ( 1872 – 1923 ) was a French chemist known for his 1905 discovery of the Boudouard reaction . Octave Leopold Boudouard became a professor at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers in Paris .
He worked in various fields of applied chemistry , such as the chemistry of fuels and clays .
His most important work was his research into chemical equilibria when reducing iron oxides in a blast furnace .
In 1901 he proposed the first theory of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide , where he considered that metal oxide was reacting with carbon .
In 1905 Boudouard identified the Boudouard reaction , where carbon and carbon dioxide combine to form carbon monoxide at high temperatures , while the reverse occurs at lower temperatures .
In 1912 he published a paper on the odors of Paris , researching the chemicals polluting the air of that city . The Boudouard reaction is : Boudouard found that when an excess of coke reacts with air or metal oxides , below about 400 ° C this produces carbon dioxide and soot , while at temperatures above 1,000 ° C it produces carbon monoxide .
Between these extremes a mixture of the carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide and soot is produced Understanding the reaction is a significant factor in the design of blast furnaces where the goal is to maximize use of fuel while minimizing production of soot . NotesCitationsSources

Samuel VaughanSamuel Vaughan ( 1720 – 1802 ) was an English merchant , plantation owner , and political radical . Born in Ireland , Vaughan &amp; apos ; s parents were Benjamin Vaughan and Ann Wolf ; he was the youngest of a family of 12 .
He was a merchant and plantation owner , living largely in Jamaica , from 1736 to 1752 , when he set up business as a merchant banker at Dunster &amp; apos ; s Court , Mincing Lane , in the City of London . In politics Vaughan supported John Wilkes .
He sent his five sons to Warrington Academy , Benjamin and William being taught by Joseph Priestley , with whom a strong family connection was forged .
In early 1769 Vaughan was using his contact with John Seddon of Warrington to circulate Wilkite literature in Lancashire .
He also hoped to recruit supporters in Manchester and Liverpool through Seddon .
With Joseph Mawbey and others , Vaughan was a founder of the Bill of Rights Society ( Society of Gentlemen Supporters of the Bill of Rights ) .
It was a trust giving financial support to Wilkes , and the treasurers were Vaughan , Richard Oliver and John Trevanion ( 1740 – 1810 ) .
The Society set about dealing with Wilkes &amp; apos ; s tangled money affairs . Vaughan belonged to what Benjamin Franklin fondly called , the Club of Honest Whigs , which met at St Paul &amp; apos ; s Coffee-house in St Paul &amp; apos ; s-churchyard .
His support for the cause of Corsica in 1768 brought him the acquaintance of James Boswell through the Club .
Vaughan was a trustee of funds for Corsica , with William Beckford and Barlow Trecothick . In December 1774 Benjamin Franklin and Josiah Quincy II stayed with Vaughan at Wanstead in Essex .
In the period 1781 – 2 the parliamentary reformer Christopher Wyvill met radical leaders at Vaughan &amp; apos ; s house .
There resulted a political pact for the following session of parliament , of mutual support between Wyvill and a radical group around Vaughan ( including John Jebb , John Horne Tooke , and James Townsend ) .
Vaughan joined the Society for Constitutional Information in the 1780s .
Through William Beckford , he met the Earl of Shelburne .
When Shelburne became Prime Minister , the Vaughan family influence reached foreign policy , trying to split the United States from their French allies in some ultimately unsuccessful moves of 1782 . The Vaughan family was part of the congregation of the dissenting minister Richard Price .
Samuel Vaughan was a friend of the elder William Hazlitt , the Unitarian minister .
Vaughan &amp; apos ; s religious views have been described as &amp; quot ; free-thinking Unitarian &amp; quot ; . Vaughan purchased in 1765 the post of Clerk to the Supreme Court of Jamaica .
In 1769 Vaughan then offered the Duke of Grafton , a government minister , a sum of £ 5000 to secure a reversion , to hold this official place in the family for three of his sons .
Grafton brought a King &amp; apos ; s Bench case against Vaughan , which resulted in embarrassment to both parties .
The prominence of the issue led the campaigning writer Junius to expose a previous sale of office by Grafton .
This was the post of Collector of Customs in Exeter , to a Mr .
Hine , for which Grafton took £ 3,500 ; and the implication was that the money went to a card-sharp . Vaughan put his side of the case in &amp; quot ; An Appeal to the Public on Behalf of Samuel Vaughan , Esq .
in a fall and impartial Narrative of his Negotiation with the Duke of Grafton &amp; quot ; ; and Grafton dropped the prosecution .
Even so , Vaughan &amp; apos ; s actions appeared to be a political gaffe to some of the political radicals , Vaughan &amp; apos ; s allies .
Anna Barbauld , a family friend , wrote a poem complimenting his wife Sarah as a gesture of support . Some of Vaughan &amp; apos ; s sons became involved in the plantation business , and its London end Vaughan &amp; amp ; Co .
Benjamin visited Jamaica in the early 1770s , and in parliament in the 1790s defended slavery on the island .
William worked in the company , and became prominent in the London Society of West India Merchants .
Vaughan himself visited Jamaica again in 1775 .
The Vaughan estates were Flamstead and Vaughansfield in Saint James Parish , Jamaica , slave-run sugar plantations .
Vaughansfield was involved in the Second Maroon War in the neighbouring Trelawny Parish .
Samuel Vaughan junior became proprietor of these estates . After the end of the American War of Independence Vaughan made several long stays in the United States .
There were three separate visits .
Vaughan was accompanied by his family , but sent them home in 1786 .
He wrote to Richard Price in 1785 of the American principles of government as being &amp; quot ; the permanent security of the rights of mankind &amp; quot ; . Vaughan was on good terms with George Washington ; Washington wrote to him on 30 November 1785 about gifts of a pamphlet of Mirabeau on the Society of the Cincinnati , and Jamaican rum .
They had met in Philadelphia in December 1783 .
There Vaughan planned the planting of the State House garden , as well as laying out the gardens of Gray &amp; apos ; s Ferry Tavern in the English style .
In Philadelphia also , with Francis Hopkinson , he helped revive the American Philosophical Society ; and provided a sketch-plan for Philosophical Hall . As Vaughan explained to Humphry Marshall , he planned to plant the State House Yard with a representative collection of American trees and shrubs .
The ambition was a political statement , on the unity of the newly United States , and was shared by Washington and Thomas Jefferson as gardeners .
In Philadelphia for the Constitutional Convention during the summer of 1787 , Vaughan paid a visit in July to William Bartram &amp; apos ; s nursery , from which he ordered 55 species of plants .
The State House project &amp; apos ; s greater scope was abandoned , but Vaughan saw to the publication of Marshall &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Arbustum Americanum &amp; quot ; , in 1785 .
He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1786 . In 1787 also , Vaughan visited Mount Vernon , and drew a plan of the garden .
He gave Washington a marble mantelpiece for the house . Vaughan also spent time in Hallowell , Maine , meeting up with William Hazlitt there in the winter of 1784 – 5 .
Sarah Vaughan had inherited property on the Kennebec River , from her father , who was a &amp; quot ; Kennebeck Proprietor &amp; quot ; , and also a congregationalist supporter of the Brattle Square Church .
Two of the Vaughan sons ( Benjamin and Charles ) settled there , and another ( John , a business partner of Robert Morris ) at Philadelphia .
Samuel Vaughan in fact intended a religious project in the area , which was put in the hands of Charles , who became a &amp; quot ; Kennebeck Proprietor &amp; quot ; ; but the original aim became muted as Charles &amp; apos ; s lack of business acumen showed through . In 1790 Vaughan attended the funeral of his friend Benjamin Franklin .

Ubuntu GNOMEUbuntu GNOME ( formerly Ubuntu GNOME Remix ) is a discontinued Linux distribution , distributed as free and open-source software .
It uses a pure GNOME 3 desktop environment with GNOME Shell , rather than the Unity graphical shell .
Starting with version 13 . 04 it became an official &amp; quot ; flavour &amp; quot ; of the Ubuntu operating system . In April 2017 , it was announced that 17 . 04 would be the last release .
The distribution was to be discontinued in favor of the standard Ubuntu distribution , which switched from using Unity to GNOME Shell as its desktop environment , starting with its 17 . 10 release . The project began as an unofficial &amp; quot ; remix &amp; quot ; because some users preferred the GNOME 3 desktop over Unity .
Ubuntu GNOME 12 . 10 &amp; quot ; Quantal Quetzal &amp; quot ; was the first stable version released on 18 October 2012 . Writing in October 2013 , Jim Lynch stated : Jim Lynch reviewed Ubuntu GNOME 14 . 04 LTS again in April 2014 and concluded , On 5 April 2017 Canonical Executive Chairman and Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth announced that the mainline version of Ubuntu will move from Unity to the GNOME 3 desktop starting by version 18 . 04 LTS , which would make it virtually identical to Ubuntu GNOME .
It was later revealed that Ubuntu 17 . 10 would in fact be the first version to use GNOME . Shuttleworth wrote on 8 April 2017 , &amp; quot ; We will invest in Ubuntu GNOME with the intent of delivering a fantastic all-GNOME desktop .
We &amp; apos ; re helping the Ubuntu GNOME team , not creating something different or competitive with that effort .
While I am passionate about the design ideas in Unity , and hope GNOME may be more open to them now , I think we should respect the GNOME design leadership by delivering GNOME the way GNOME wants it delivered .
Our role in that , as usual , will be to make sure that upgrades , integration , security , performance and the full experience are fantastic . &amp; quot ; In light of Ubuntu &amp; apos ; s announcement that they would switch desktop environments from Unity to GNOME , the Ubuntu GNOME developers announced on 13 April 2017 that the distribution would merge into the mainline Ubuntu , starting with the 17 . 10 release .

NeverwareNeverware is a Google-backed , VC-backed technology company that provides a service intended to make aging PCs faster and more secure .
In February 2015 the company launched its second product , CloudReady ; an operating system built on Google &amp; apos ; s open-source operating system Chromium .
CloudReady can be installed on PCs and Macs up to 10 years old in order to speed them up and make them perform like a Chromebook .
CloudReady machines can even be managed in the Google Admin Console , which is a true line of demarcation from just installing Chrome .
It was founded by CEO Jonathan Hefter and currently specializes in the education sector .
It is headquartered in the Flatiron District of Manhattan . Hefter began developing Neverware ’ s core technology in 2009 after graduating from Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania .
In May 2010 Dogpatch Labs invited Hefter to work out of their Manhattan incubator , and in early 2011 Neverware officially formed , moved to General Assembly ’ s Manhattan location , and began operations . After a successful pilot program , Neverware launched in January 2013 , rolling its service out around New York City . CloudReady was released at the 2015 TCEA conference in Texas , indicating a broader national reach on the part of the company .
Within weeks the product was picked up by education bloggers .
The new Neverware product is clearly staying true to the company and Hefter &amp; apos ; s original vision to connect students with equitable , quality access to technology , and obviously their product development strategy identified Google as a major force in the education landscape , as well as a strategic partner / investor , as of Google &amp; apos ; s investment in Neverware in the Fall of 2017 . Neverware ’ s first product , now branded PCReady , revolves around their proprietary server computer , called a Juicebox , which generates thin clients – a special kind of virtual machine .
The Juicebox , which is installed locally , handles all processing and computing tasks and relegates only simple display and input tasks to the user ’ s machine .
This is at the heart of Neverware ’ s business model , as it allows for outdated and even some broken technology to provide full functionality . The current model Juicebox is designed specifically for education environments , providing a solution that is less expensive than comparable enterprise services . Neverware &amp; apos ; s second product , CloudReady , follows Google into the cloud .
The CloudReady operating system was built on Google &amp; apos ; s open-source Chromium and allows schools , government organizations , non-profits and enterprises to revive their existing hardware while taking advantage of the Google Admin Console &amp; apos ; s power and ease-of-use .
For schools , this also means giving students and teachers greater access to the ubiquitous Google Apps for Education .
CloudReady is differentiated from other options by the fact that machines running the OS can be managed alongside Chromebooks in the Google Admin Console , support is provided for hundreds of computer models , and mass deployment to many devices through tools like SCCM , Ghost , FOG and WDS can be coordinated .
This allows school district and enterprise IT administrators the control and security features they need , as well as a simple , sustainable alternative to surplussing existing machines .
Since this article was published the company has changed its pricing structure to these three options for education : Annual Device License - $ 15 per device per yearPerpetual License - $ 59 per device * ( comes bundled with 3 years of technical support ) District Site License - $ 1 per student per year ( includes unlimited use ; minimum order of $ 2500 ) Neverware ’ s PCReady service includes full installation and setup of the Juicebox server , and continual system maintenance and support . CloudReady is a single time installation , from USB Neverware ’ s investors include Google , Khosla Ventures , Upfront Ventures , Thrive Capital , General Catalyst Partners , Collaborative Fund , OurCrowd , Mark Suster and Nihal Mehta . Rethink Education became a major investor in Neverware in October 2014 Neverware has received media attention for its investment from Google , young founder , noteworthy cause , and projected viability .
It has also been lauded for its potential for reducing Ewaste by extending the lifespan of aging hardware .

Bear ( 2011 film ) Bear is a 2011 Australian short black comedy drama film directed by Nash Edgerton and written by David Michod and Nash Edgerton .
The film had its world premiere in competition at the Cannes Film Festival on 21 May 2011 . Emelie is greatly annoyed by her significant other Jack .
After she leaves to ride her bicycle along a trail , Jack gets into his car with a box and drives to the trail .
As Emelie is riding her bike , she is startled by a bear , and accidentally falls off a cliff .
Behind the bear , there are colourful birthday decorations .
The bear , revealed to be Jack in a bear costume , rushes down the cliff to Emelie &amp; apos ; s side .
After reconciling with the injured Emelie , he jokingly puts the bear mask back on , and is shot by a bear hunter . The film earned mainly positive reviews from critics .
Ivan Kander of &amp; quot ; short of the week &amp; quot ; gave film the positive review said &amp; quot ; Edgerton isn ’ t trying to surprise you — he already pulled off that magic trick once with Spider .
Instead , he ’ s reveling a bit in a sort of misanthropic playground .
Our protagonist is a cartoon character of sorts — the Wile E .
Coyote of cinematic schadenfreude .
He ’ s always getting himself , and his loved ones , into the darndest , deadliest situations .
And , all the while , we can ’ t help but laugh at his misfortune . &amp; quot ; David Brook of &amp; quot ; blue print review &amp; quot ; gave the film three and a half out of five stars and said &amp; quot ; A sequel to Spider , Bear basically replays the gag in a new setting .
Predictable of course for this reason , but still funny and well produced . &amp; quot ; Another critic in his review said that &amp; quot ; Reviewing a film this short is going to be fairly similar to reviewing an advert , because and with so little time to build character or a world , it essentially comes down to did you did or did you didn ’ t like the punch .
In this case , I did , it gave me a legitimate ‘ I didn ’ t see that coming ’ moment , upon the fact that it was coolly put together and even pulls of a very impressive stunt .
Not one I ’ ll remember for the rest of my days for sure , but an amusing distraction , which is exactly what I think it was designed to be . &amp; quot ; The film received a honorable mention in the category &amp; quot ; Best narrative short film &amp; quot ; at the 12th International Cycling Film Festival 2017 . &amp; quot ; Bear &amp; quot ; is a follow-up of Edgerton &amp; apos ; s 2007 short film &amp; quot ; Spider &amp; quot ; .

Twenty Thirteen TourThe Twenty Thirteen Tour was a concert tour by industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails to support the album &amp; quot ; Hesitation Marks &amp; quot ; .
It marked the return of the band for live performances after a four-year touring hiatus .
It began on July 26 , 2013 and ended on August 30 , 2014 . In February 2009 , Trent Reznor stated , &amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; ve been thinking for some time now it &amp; apos ; s time to make NIN disappear for a while . &amp; quot ; , indicating the possible end of the act .
Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a tour with Jane &amp; apos ; s Addiction , dubbed &amp; quot ; NIN &amp; # 124 ; JA &amp; quot ; .
Afterwards , Reznor clarified that the band is done with touring for the foreseeable future but he will continue to make music under the moniker .
Nine Inch Nails &amp; apos ; final live performance was September 10 , 2009 at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles .
Reznor also sold numerous performance gears , which include instruments , staging , amplifiers and effects units on eBay after the last concert .
Since the final show , until the release of &amp; quot ; Hesitation Marks &amp; quot ; in 2013 , Reznor released only two tracks as Nine Inch Nails : the theme song for the film , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; and a cover of &amp; quot ; Zoo Station &amp; quot ; by U2 , for the tribute album &amp; quot ; AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered &amp; quot ; . Reznor began pursuing other projects .
In 2010 , he formed the post-industrial project , How to Destroy Angels with long-time collaborator Atticus Ross and West Indian Girl frontwoman Mariqueen Maandig , whom he was married in 2009 .
In 2010 , the band released their self-titled EP , which was followed by &amp; quot ; An omen EP _ &amp; quot ; in 2012 and their debut album , &amp; quot ; Welcome Oblivion &amp; quot ; , in 2013 .
In 2010 , Reznor also collaborated with Atticus Ross on the original score for David Fincher &amp; apos ; s 2010 film , &amp; quot ; The Social Network &amp; quot ; .
The duo won a 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture and a 2010 Academy Award for Best Original Score .
Reznor and Ross again collaborated with Fincher for the official score the American adaptation of the novel &amp; quot ; The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo &amp; quot ; , released in December 2011 , before going on to score their third Fincher collaboration with &amp; quot ; Gone Girl &amp; quot ; ( 2014 ) . In an interview with BBC Radio 1 , Reznor indicated that he would be writing for the majority of 2012 with Nine Inch Nails &amp; quot ; in mind &amp; quot ; .
In 2012 , he confirmed that he was working on new Nine Inch Nails material and might be performing live again .
In February 2013 , Reznor announced the return of Nine Inch Nails and revealed tour details .
He also revealed that the new lineup of the band included Eric Avery of Jane &amp; apos ; s Addiction , Adrian Belew of King Crimson , and Joshua Eustis of Telefon Tel Aviv , as well as returning members Alessandro Cortini and Ilan Rubin .
However , both Avery and Belew quit before the tour commenced , with former member Robin Finck returning in their place . On February 23 , 2013 , it was announced that the band would perform at Fuji Rock Festival , Pukkelpop and Rock &amp; apos ; n &amp; apos ; Heim Festival in Hockenheim , Germany in mid-2013 .

Relaxed intersectionThe &amp; quot ; relaxed intersection &amp; quot ; of &amp; quot ; m &amp; quot ; sets corresponds to the classicalintersection between sets except that it is allowed to relax few sets in order to avoid an empty intersection . This notion can be used to solve Constraints Satisfaction Problemsthat are inconsistent by relaxing a small number of constraints . When a bounded-error approach is considered for parameter estimation , the relaxed intersection makes it possible to be robust with respectto some outliers . The &amp; quot ; q &amp; quot ; -relaxed intersection of the &amp; quot ; m &amp; quot ; subsetsformula _ 1of formula _ 2 , denoted byformula _ 3is the set of allformula _ 4which belong to allformula _ 5 &amp; apos ; s , exceptformula _ 6at most . This definition is illustrated by Figure 1 . Defineformula _ 7We haveformula _ 8Characterizing the q-relaxed intersection is a thus a set inversion problem . Consider 8 intervals : formula _ 9formula _ 10formula _ 11formula _ 12formula _ 13formula _ 14We haveformula _ 15formula _ 16formula _ 17formula _ 18formula _ 19formula _ 20formula _ 21The relaxed intersection of intervals is not necessary an interval .
We thus takethe interval hull of the result .
If formula _ 22 &amp; apos ; s are intervals , the relaxedintersection can be computed with a complexity of &amp; quot ; m &amp; quot ; . log ( &amp; quot ; m &amp; quot ; ) by using the Marzullo &amp; apos ; s algorithm .
It suffices tosort all lower and upper bounds of the &amp; quot ; m &amp; quot ; intervals to represent thefunction formula _ 23 .
Then , we easily get the setformula _ 24which corresponds to a union of intervals . We then return thesmallest interval which contains this union . Figure 2 shows the functionformula _ 25associated to the previous example . To compute the &amp; quot ; q &amp; quot ; -relaxed intersection of &amp; quot ; m &amp; quot ; boxes offormula _ 26 , we project all &amp; quot ; m &amp; quot ; boxes with respect to the &amp; quot ; n &amp; quot ; axes . For each of the &amp; quot ; n &amp; quot ; groups of &amp; quot ; m &amp; quot ; intervals , we compute the &amp; quot ; q &amp; quot ; -relaxed intersection . We return Cartesian product of the &amp; quot ; n &amp; quot ; resulting intervals . Figure 3 provides anillustration of the 4-relaxed intersection of 6 boxes .
Each point of thered box belongs to 4 of the 6 boxes . The &amp; quot ; q &amp; quot ; -relaxed union of formula _ 27 is defined byformula _ 28Note that when &amp; quot ; q &amp; quot ; = 0 , the relaxed union / intersection corresponds tothe classical union / intersection .
More precisely , we haveformula _ 29andformula _ 30If formula _ 31 denotes the complementary set of formula _ 22 , we haveformula _ 33formula _ 34As a consequenceformula _ 35Let formula _ 36 be &amp; quot ; m &amp; quot ; contractors for the sets formula _ 37 , thenformula _ 38is a contractor for formula _ 39andformula _ 40is a contractor for formula _ 41 , whereformula _ 42are contractors forformula _ 43Combined with a branch-and-bound algorithm such as SIVIA ( Set Inversion Via Interval Analysis ) , the &amp; quot ; q &amp; quot ; -relaxedintersection of &amp; quot ; m &amp; quot ; subsets of formula _ 2 can be computed .

Nicario Jiménez QuispeNicario Jiménez Quispe ( born in 1957 ) is a Peruvian-American retablo maker .
He was born in the village of Alcamenca in Ayacucho , Peru , high in the Andes mountain range .
He makes traditional Andean altarpieces , small wooden boxes filled with figures , animals and other objects that tell a story .
Spanish priests used them to teach about the Catholic saints .
He is a third generation retablo artist and learned the tradition from his father and grandfather .
He also studied sculpture at several universities in Peru .
The main altarpieces represent religious , historical and everyday life events .
They can be humorous or political .
His works are based on their pre-Hispanic Andean art and family influences .
In 2012 , he was the recipient of a Florida Folk Heritage Award . His altarpiece figurines are made by hand with a mix of boiled potato and gypsum powder .
His work has appeared in major museum exhibitions , including the Smithsonian Institution where they are part of the permanent collection .
Nicario has taught at universities and international conferences , and his work is in many prestigious art collections .
Jimenez is now living in Naples , Florida , where he creates retablos that feature different stories of the struggles of Latino immigrants and scenes of Hispanic neighborhoods in South Florida .
Through his works , Nicario Jimenez , the &amp; quot ; artist of the Andes , &amp; quot ; has shared the art form of the altarpiece with audiences around the world .
Teversall Manor railway stationTeversall Manor is a former railway station in Teversal , Nottinghamshire on the Derbyshire border west of Mansfield . There were two stations in Teversal , one built by the Midland Railway on a line running South-North from Whiteborough to Pleasley West , the other by built the Great Northern Railway at the end of a one-mile branch line westwards from Skegby . Despite being fully equipped with a building and platform , the Great Northern station only ever carried unadvertised workmens &amp; apos ; trains and seaside excursions .
It does not appear in the 1922 &amp; quot ; Bradshaw &amp; apos ; s Guide &amp; quot ; or later timetables .
It was visited by a Stephenson Locomotive Society &amp; quot ; Farewell &amp; quot ; enthusiasts &amp; apos ; special on 4 May 1968 . The ex-Midland line bridged the ex-GNR line in Teversal and the stations were fairly close to each other , the ex-Midland station being on the higher level . From inception they were both called &amp; quot ; Teversall &amp; quot ; with two &amp; quot ; l &amp; quot ; s . After nationalisation in 1948 the early British Railways had a policy of renaming stations where confusion over names could occur , typically in towns and villages where two or more stations existed .
Teversal had two stations , so , although one had closed to regular passenger services and the other had never provided any , they provided other services such as goods and excursions .
They were therefore renamed . The ex-MR Teversal station became &amp; quot ; Teversall Manor &amp; quot ; and the ex-GNR Teversal station became &amp; quot ; Teversall East &amp; quot ; . This article concerns the ex-Midland railway station on the line from Tibshelf and Whiteborough to Pleasley . The station was built by the Midland Railway on the circuitous Mansfield to Westhouses via Mansfield Woodhouse and Tibshelf line known as &amp; quot ; The Teversall &amp; amp ; Pleasley Branch &amp; quot ; .
The line &amp; apos ; s primary purpose was to carry coal . The station was opened without ceremony on 1 May 1886 when the Teversall &amp; amp ; Pleasley Branch opened to passenger traffic .
It initially provided a service of four trains each way between Mansfield and Alfreton via Mansfield Woodhouse , Tevershall and Tibshelf , taking about 40 minutes from end to end . The station had a typical Midland Railway country station building very similar to Pleasley West . By 1922 the passenger service through the station was down to three trains each way Monday to Saturday .
There never was a Sunday service .
By 1930 this had fallen to one train a day southbound and , curiously , two a day northbound .
On 28 July 1930 passenger services were withdrawn . As the station remained open for goods it was renamed &amp; quot ; Teversall Manor &amp; quot ; in 1950 to avoid confusion with the obscure ex-GNR terminus station nearby . Excursions and railtours continued until 1963 . Through traffic was rendered impossible from 1964 when the line North from Pleasley Colliery to the junction with what is now the Robin Hood Line closed .
Pleasley Colliery subsequently sent its coal underground to Shirebrook and Teversall Colliery closed in 1980 .
Coal continued to be dug from Silverhill Colliery until 1992 and passed through the site of Teversall Manor station .
After the colliery closed the line became redundant and was subsequently lifted . The station buildings have been razed to the ground . Parts of the trackbed of this and neighbouring lines have been turned into public footpaths and bridleways .

Suicide terminologyHistorically , suicide terminology has been rife with issues of nomenclature , and terminology has often been defined differently depending on the purpose of the definition ( e . g . , medical , legal , administrative ) .
A lack of agreed-upon nomenclature and operational definitions has complicated understanding .
In 2007 , attempts were made to reach some consensus .
There is also controversy over the terms commit and committed as they relate to completed and attempted suicide . Suicidal ideation is any self-reported thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior .
Subtypes of suicide-related ideations depend on the presence or absence of suicidal intent . To have suicidal intent is to have suicide or deliberate self-killing as one &amp; apos ; s purpose .
Intent refers to the aim , purpose , or goal of the behavior rather than the behavior itself .
The term connotes a conscious desire or wish to leave or escape from life , and also connotes a resolve to act .
This is contrasted with suicidal motivation , or the driving force behind ideation or intent , which need not be conscious . &amp; quot ; Suicide-related ideation with no suicidal intention &amp; quot ; is when an individual has thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior but has no intention to do so . When an individual is unable to clarify whether suicidal intent was present or not , the term &amp; quot ; undetermined degree of suicidal intent &amp; quot ; is used . &amp; quot ; Suicide-related ideation with some suicidal intent &amp; quot ; is when an individual has thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior and possesses suicidal intent . Suicide-related communications are any interpersonal act of imparting , conveying , or transmitting thoughts , wishes , desires , or intent for which there is evidence ( either explicit or implicit ) that the act of communication is not itself a self-inflicted behavior or self-injurious .
This broad definition includes two subsets . A suicide threat is any interpersonal action , verbal or nonverbal , without a direct self-injurious component , that a reasonable person would interpret as communicating or suggesting that suicidal behavior might occur in the near future . A suicide plan is a proposed method of carrying out a design that will lead to a potentially self-injurious outcome ; a systematic formulation of a program of action that has the potential for resulting in self-injury . &amp; quot ; Suicide Threat , Type I &amp; quot ; is a suicide threat with no associated suicidal intent .
The threat may be verbal or nonverbal , passive or active . &amp; quot ; Suicide Plan , Type I &amp; quot ; is the expression of a definite plan to end one &amp; apos ; s life but with no suicidal intent . &amp; quot ; Suicide Threat , Type II &amp; quot ; is a suicide threat with an undetermined level of suicidal intent .
The threat may be verbal or nonverbal , passive or covert . &amp; quot ; Suicide Plan , Type II &amp; quot ; is a proposed method of achieving a potentially self-injurious outcome with an undetermined level of intent . &amp; quot ; Suicide Threat , Type III &amp; quot ; is a suicide threat with some degree of suicidal intent .
The threat may be verbal or nonverbal , passive or covert . &amp; quot ; Suicide Plan , Type III &amp; quot ; is a proposed method of achieving a potentially self-injurious outcome with some suicidal intent . Suicide related behavior is a self-inflicted , potentially injurious behavior for which there is evidence ( either explicit or implicit ) either that : ( a ) the person wished to use the appearance of intending to kill himself / herself in order to attain some other end ; or ( b ) the person intended at some undetermined or some known degree to kill himself / herself .
Suicide-related behaviors can result in no injuries , injuries , or death .
Suicide-related behaviors comprise self-harm , self-inflicted unintentional death , undetermined suicide-related behaviors , self-inflicted death with undetermined intent , suicide attempt , and suicide . Self-harm is self-inflicted , potentially injurious behavior for which there is evidence ( either implicit or explicit ) that the person did not intend to kill himself / herself ( i . e . , had no intent to die ) .
Persons engage in self-harm behaviors when they wish to use the appearance of intending to kill themselves in order to attain some other end ( e . g . , to seek help , to punish others , to receive attention , or to regulate negative mood ) .
Self-harm may result in no injuries , injuries , or death . Suicide gesture is an outdated term .
Behavior that previously might have been labeled a suicide gesture , if there is no suicidal intent , is labeled as Self Harm , Type I ( no injury ) or Self-Harm , Type II ( with injury ) , because the purpose of the behaviors is to alter one &amp; apos ; s life circumstances ( interpersonal or intrapersonal ) in a manner without suicidal intent but involving self-inflicted behaviors ( whether or not it resulted in injuries ) .
If there is an undetermined degree of suicidal intent , it is labeled as Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior , Type I ( no injury ) , or Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior , Type II ( with injury ) . &amp; quot ; Self-Harm , Type I &amp; quot ; is self-harm that has not resulted in injury . &amp; quot ; Self-Harm , Type II &amp; quot ; is self-harm that has resulted in nonfatal injury . &amp; quot ; Self-Inflicted Unintentional Death &amp; quot ; is self-harm that has resulted in death .
It is defined as from self-inflicted injury , poisoning , or suffocation where there is evidence ( either explicit or implicit ) that there was no intent to die .
This category includes those injuries or poisonings described as unintended or accidental . Suicide-related Behavior With Undetermined Degree of Suicide Intent is self-inflicted , potentially injurious behavior where intent is unknown . &amp; quot ; Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior , Type I &amp; quot ; is self-injurious behavior that has not resulted in injuries and for which the person is unable to admit positively to the intent to die or is reluctant to admit positively to the intent to die due to other psychological states . &amp; quot ; Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior , Type II &amp; quot ; is self-injurious behavior that has resulted in injuries and for which the person is unable to admit positively to the intent to die or is reluctant to admit positively to the intent to die due to other psychological states . &amp; quot ; Self-Inflicted Death with Undetermined Intent &amp; quot ; is self-injurious behavior that has resulted in fatal injury and for which intent is either equivocal or unknown . A suicide attempt is defined as a self-inflicted , potentially injurious behavior with a nonfatal outcome for which there is evidence ( either explicit or implicit ) of intent to die .
A suicide attempt may result in no injuries , injuries , or death . Suicide Attempt , Type I is a suicide attempt with some degree of suicidal intent and no resultant injuries , regardless of the degree of injury or lethality of method . Suicide Attempt , Type II is a suicide attempt with some degree of suicidal intent and resultant injuries . A suicide is a self-inflicted death with evidence ( either explicit or implicit ) of intent to die .
The term completed suicide has also been used synonymously , but is generally believed to be redundant and potentially pejorative , and , as such , is not recommended . According to Fairbairn , &amp; quot ; The most common way of speaking about suicide is to talk of its being &amp; apos ; committed &amp; apos ; . &amp; quot ; In fact , &amp; quot ; committed suicide &amp; quot ; or similar descriptions continue to be the norm in both scholarly research and journalism .
Advocacy groups have suggested that this phrasing has become so entrenched in English vocabulary that it has gained &amp; quot ; a naturalness which implies a deceptive harmlessness . &amp; quot ; Fairburn further acknowledged the difficulty in finding alternative means of referring to suicide which &amp; quot ; are neither clumsy nor misleading , &amp; quot ; However , while common , Lebacqz &amp; amp ; Englehardt argue that referring to suicide as an act &amp; quot ; committed &amp; quot ; may be hazardous to ethical clarity .
Others have also argued in favour of alternative language regarding suicide , both in the interest of moral and ethical precision , as well as scientific and clinical clarity .
A United States Navy report urges against the use of the term &amp; quot ; committed suicide &amp; quot ; on similar grounds , asserting that &amp; quot ; suicide is better understood when framed objectively within the context of behavioral health . &amp; quot ; The alleged lack of clarity in English suicide terminology has been attributed to the connotations of crime , dishonour , and sin that suicide may carry .
The German term &amp; quot ; Selbstmord begehen &amp; quot ; is similar , denoting an act of commission .
Common language has been described as &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; portraying &amp; # 93 ; suicide as a &amp; apos ; crime &amp; apos ; to be &amp; apos ; committed &amp; apos ; as is , for example , murder . &amp; quot ; This is despite the fact that suicide is largely no longer a crime , and that , as noted suicidologist Samuel Wallace wrote , &amp; quot ; all suicide is neither abhorrent nor not ; insane or not ; selfish or not ; rational or not ; justifiable or not . &amp; quot ; Canadian suicide prevention activist , P .
Bonny Ball , commented that the alleged criminal implications of suicide are a carryover from the Middle Ages when suicide was considered &amp; quot ; both illegal and sinful by the laws and religions of the time . &amp; quot ; Sommer-Rotenberg had similarly argued that &amp; quot ; the act of self-killing was considered criminal because it was perceived as transgressing the moral authority of God and the righteous feelings of humankind . &amp; quot ; Since &amp; quot ; committing suicide &amp; quot ; was akin to committing murder or rape , it has been argued that they continue to be linked in some languages .
However , this common English expression is not universal : &amp; quot ; By contrast the French &amp; quot ; se suicider &amp; quot ; and the Italian &amp; quot ; uccidersi &amp; quot ; are reflexive .
Likewise in Hebrew : &amp; quot ; l &amp; apos ; hit &amp; apos ; abbed &amp; quot ; , &amp; apos ; to self-destroy , &amp; apos ; is something one does to oneself , with no implication of criminality . &amp; quot ; Various alternatives have been proposed to alter the language regarding the act of suicide from a variety of sectors – including government , journalism , community mental health advocates , and the scientific community .
Terms such as &amp; quot ; death by suicide , &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; non-fatal suicide attempt &amp; quot ; have been suggested to be more objective .
The World Health Organization has agreed that these terms &amp; quot ; are more accurate and less open to misinterpretation . &amp; quot ; The National Institute of Mental Health , the largest research organization in the world specializing in mental illness , also recommends such phrasing as &amp; quot ; completed suicide , &amp; quot ; or &amp; quot ; kill him / herself . &amp; quot ; As it applies to a direct clinical context , the widely cited Beck Classification of Suicidal Behaviour exclusively uses the terminology of &amp; quot ; complete suicide . &amp; quot ; This classification was revisited in a number of notable documents ( such as the Operational Classification for Determination of Suicide , the &amp; apos ; Tower of Babel &amp; apos ; nomenclature , the WHO / EURO definitions , the Columbia University suicidality classification , the CDC self-directed violence surveillance system , and the Denver VA VISN 19 MIRECC self-directed violence classification system ) . Advocacy groups have suggested a variety of guidelines for suicide terminology .
As it concerns media reporting of suicide , a key indicator of guideline influence on language as it is practiced in that context reports including one by the Annenberg School for Communication &amp; apos ; s Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggests that there is &amp; quot ; evidence of a change in reporting practices following the release of the new media guidelines &amp; quot ;
Modern Hungary MovementThe Modern Hungary Movement ( ) , abbreviated to MoMa , is a liberal conservative political party in Hungary .
Founded by former Finance Minister Lajos Bokros MEP on 21 April 2013 , MoMa stands for free market , liberal values and champions &amp; quot ; individual freedom , the free market , and the freedom of private and intellectual property &amp; quot ; . The party claims to be modelled on the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom . MoMa decided not to participate in the 2014 parliamentary election , because &amp; quot ; they do not want to weaken the cooperation of left-wing parties with separate candidates . &amp; quot ; Bokros criticized and resented that his party were excluded from the alliance .
Later MoMa formally asked its supporters to vote Unity in the 2014 general election , after receiving constitutional guarantees from the left-wing opposition . The party planned to run in the 2014 European Parliament election , however its registration was refused by the National Election Office ( NVI ) .
As a result Bokros lost his European Parliament mandate .
Bokros also ran for Mayor of Budapest in the 2014 municipal election .
On 29 September 2014 , two other candidates , the independent György Magyar and candidate of the leftist opposition parties &amp; apos ; Ferenc Falus withdrew from the election and supported Bokros .
Bokros received 36 . 04 % of the votes and came second after István Tarlós .
He was supported by Together 2014 , the Democratic Coalition and the Budapest branch of the Hungarian Socialist Party . In September 2017 , the MoMa made an electoral coalition with the Democratic Coalition ( DK ) for the 2018 parliamentary election .
In the same time Bokros announced his &amp; quot ; 500 days programme &amp; quot ; which contained the short-lived inevitable cooperation of the &amp; quot ; democratic opposition parties &amp; quot ; after the victory to &amp; quot ; restore democracy &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; break down the Orbán regime &amp; quot ; .
Bokros argued another by-election is required after the successful restoration .
In January 2018 , Bokros announced the DK has not kept its promise and rejected the agreement ; as a result the MoMa aimed to participate in the election individually .
DK issued a statement saying , Bokros refused their &amp; quot ; fair offer &amp; quot ; to provide a single mandate for his party with &amp; quot ; not measurable support &amp; quot ; . For the Hungarian Parliament :

Olaf PedersenOlaf Pedersen ( 1920 – 1997 ) was a &amp; quot ; leading authority on astronomy in classical antiquity and the Latin middle ages &amp; quot ; Olaf Pedersen was born April 8 , 1920 in Egtved , Jutland , Denmark .
At the University of Copenhagen he studied in Niels Bohr ’ s institute , graduating in 1943 when the country was occupied by German forces .
He began his teaching career in Randers , Jutland , teaching physics .
He entered scholarship studying the philosophy and history of ideas .
After the war he studied with Etienne Gilson in Paris .
Returning to Denmark , he obtained a doctorate for work on Nicole Oresme in 1956 , when he became a lecturer at Aarhus University . In 1965 a department for history of science was formed at Aarhus .
&amp; quot ; The staff of the department , including Pedersen , taught science as well as history of science , and though this diluted their research it kept them in contact with science and maintained their &amp; quot ; bona fides &amp; quot ; among science colleagues . &amp; quot ; In 1967 Pedersen became a professor in this department .
He published two books in 1974 : &amp; quot ; A Survey of the Almagest &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Early Physics and Astronomy &amp; quot ; .
The latter publication &amp; quot ; supplied the needs of a generation of students in the infant discipline of the history of science . &amp; quot ; Pedersen was active in other organizations : the journal Centaurus , the Steno Museum , the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science , and the International Academy of the History of Science . In 1997 Pedersen published &amp; quot ; The First Universities &amp; quot ; which received several scholarly reviews .
Ruth Karras wrote , &amp; quot ; this book begins , not as a history of universities , but as a history of learning . &amp; quot ; Her opinion was that a &amp; quot ; more balanced view for both medievalists and non-specialists &amp; quot ; was provided by volume one of &amp; quot ; A History of the University in Europe &amp; quot ; ( 1992 ) , edited by Hilde Ridder-Symoens .
A more favorable review was given by DR Jones : &amp; # 91 ; Pedersen &amp; # 93 ; &amp; quot ; develops a complex explanation of the nature of the university , if not a theory of causation .
His first universities are shaped by interweaving requirements of subject matter , teaching methods , legal and organizational means , and requirements of society and state . &amp; quot ; A balanced review was given by H .
E .
J .
Cowdrey : &amp; quot ; Perhaps the most valuable chapters of the book are those which concern the classical inheritance of medieval higher education and the transition from ancient science to monistic learning . &amp; quot ; On the other hand , Cowdrey notes a &amp; quot ; disconcerting number of factual errors &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; too much attention is given to relatively unimportant topics &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; very little account indeed has been taken of scholarly work published since the early 1970s . &amp; quot ; Marcia L .
Colish described the book as &amp; quot ; a superficial and shaky sketch of what universities actually taught .
He emphasizes the organization , not the content of education . &amp; quot ; Colish finds Pedersen prone to &amp; quot ; repeat and compound factual errors more recently given the decent burial they deserve . &amp; quot ; She suggests other , more reliable , authorities .
On the other hand , Ian P .
Wei gave the book an enthusiastic review , calling it a &amp; quot ; clear and lively work of synthesis . &amp; quot ; He wrote that the &amp; quot ; main thrust of the book is to present medieval universities as institutions which can only be understood in relation to broader political and social developments .
Particular emphasis is laid on the significance of the struggles between popes and emperors , and on Roman law .
The book ’ s greatest strength is its extraordinary breadth of vision . &amp; quot ; After an operation on his heart , Olaf Pedersen died December 3 , 1997 .
Sir Thomas Crooke , 1st BaronetSir Thomas Crooke , 1st Baronet , of Baltimore ( 1574 – 1630 ) was an English-born politician , lawyer and landowner in seventeenth-century Ireland .
He is chiefly remembered as the founder of the town of Baltimore , County Cork , which he built into a flourishing port , but which was largely destroyed shortly after his death during the Sack of Baltimore .
He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Baltimore in the Parliament of 1613 – 1615 .
He was the first of the Crooke baronets of Baltimore . He was born in Cransley , Northamptonshire , the eldest son of the Reverend Thomas Crooke ; his mother was a Miss Samuel .
His father was a Calvinist clergyman whose strong religious views often brought him into conflict with the English Crown , but who escaped serious censure , due to his position of preacher at Gray &amp; apos ; s Inn .
Helkiah Crooke , Court physician to James I , was one of Sir Thomas &amp; apos ; s brothers , and Samuel Crooke , a preacher of some note , was another brother .
Stephen Egerton , another leading Puritan preacher , married Thomas &amp; apos ; s sister Sarah .
Egerton &amp; apos ; s niece , Margaret Tyndal Winthrop , was the third wife of John Winthrop , who became a coloniser with a much wider vision than Crooke &amp; apos ; s , being several times Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony .
Crooke and Winthrop , although they must have been acquainted , are not known to have been intimate , but Crooke &amp; apos ; s sister Sarah was a close friend of Margaret Winthrop and left her a substantial legacy at her death in 1624 . Thomas spent much of his childhood in Suffolk , where his father served for some years as vicar of Great Waldingfield .
The younger Thomas , on his father &amp; apos ; s petition , was admitted to Gray &amp; apos ; s Inn in 1597 .
He is said to have acquired a successful practice at the English Bar , but after his father &amp; apos ; s death in 1598 he turned his mind towards colonisation .
His motives appear to have been twofold : to establish a thriving commercial centre , and to create a safe haven for those who shared his strong Calvinist views . In about the year 1600 Crooke enteredan agreement with Sir Fineen O &amp; apos ; Driscoll , the Gaelic lord of Baltimore in County Cork , to establish an English colony in Baltimore .
Their agreement was disrupted by the closing stages of the Nine Years War .
O &amp; apos ; Driscoll throughout his long career had been an ally of the English Crown , and was something of a royal favourite of Queen Elizabeth I ; but his relatives persuaded him , against his own better judgement , to take the Irish side at the Battle of Kinsale .
After the failure of the Irish cause at Kinsale most of his relatives fled the country , and Sir Fineen himself only obtained a royal pardon with difficulty .
His daughter Eileen married into the prominent Coppinger family , who were to cause Sir Thomas much trouble throughout his career . In 1605 Crooke decided to regularise the matter : he surrendered the extensive lands granted to him by O &amp; apos ; Driscoll to King James I and had them regranted back to him .
James disapproved of Crooke &amp; apos ; s Calvinism , but he was pragmatic enough to see the advantages to the Crown of a strong English presence in West Cork .
In 1607 the town was given the right to hold a weekly market and two fairs a year .
In 1612 it was incorporated as a borough , with a &amp; quot ; sovereign &amp; quot ; ( Crooke himself ) and twelve burgesses .
Baltimore was given the right to return two members to the Irish House of Commons , with the franchise known as a potwalloper ( that is , a constituency where every male householder with a hearth wide enough to boil or &amp; quot ; wallop &amp; quot ; a pot had the vote ) .
Crooke himself sat in the Irish Parliament of 1613 – 15 .
He reached the high point of his fortune in 1624 when he was created a baronet . The town of Baltimore thrived from the beginning : we are told that Crooke &amp; quot ; divided the town into tenements with lots for gardens , and gave to each settler land convenient for building and grazing &amp; quot ; .
It grew prosperous as a centre for the pilchard fisheries and the wine trade .
From the first foundation of the colony however there were repeated accusations that Baltimore &amp; apos ; s real prosperity depended on piracy , and that all its inhabitants , including Crooke himself , were pirates or the accomplices of pirates . The coast of West Cork has many deep sheltered coves which have always been suitable for smuggling , and the O &amp; apos ; Driscolls had for years been widely believed to take advantage of to this engage in piracy .
Not surprisingly similar accusations were made against Crooke , and in 1608 the Privy Council summoned him to London to answer a number of charges , including one that he slaughtered cattle in his own yard to victual the pirate ships .
Ominously the charge was phrased in terms of an actual verdict that he had been a &amp; quot ; chief maintainer and abettor of notorious pirates &amp; quot ; .
Crooke denied all the charges , and by now he had gained the goodwill of most of the influential men in Munster , including William Lyon , Bishop of Cork , Richard Boyle , 1st Earl of Cork , and Henry Danvers , 1st Earl of Danby , Lord President of Munster .
His friends spoke up for him : Bishop Lyon in particular praised his extraordinary achievement in having created a well-ordered town out of nothing in less than 5 years .
The Privy Council , despite what looked like a preliminary finding that he was guilty , in the end exonerated Crooke completely , but not everyone was satisfied : the authorities in Venice continued to call Baltimore &amp; quot ; a nest of pirates &amp; quot ; , and it was claimed that the entire population of the town were implicated in the illicit business .
Historians are still divided as to whether or not , and if so to what extent Crooke condoned or engaged in piracy .
The more cynical view is that the Crown was convinced of Crooke &amp; apos ; s guilt , but was unwilling to damage the growing prosperity of Baltimore . From the start of his Irish career Crooke was forced to contend with the increasing power of the wealthy Roman Catholic lawyer Sir Walter Coppinger .
Coppinger came from one of the most prominent families in Cork city ; though himself of Viking rather than Gaelic descent , he was hostile to the English settlers , and he had a reputation for ruthlessness .
In his defence it must be said that his brother Richard had married Eileen O &amp; apos ; Driscoll , daughter of Sir Fineen O &amp; apos ; Driscoll , so the Coppingers may honestly have believed that they had a better right to Baltimore than Crooke did . Almost from the beginning of the colony , Coppinger harassed the settlers with dubious legal claims to ownership of their lands .
Eventually in 1610 a compromise was reached : Crooke , Coppinger and Fineen O &amp; apos ; Driscoll jointly granted a lease of Baltimore to the settlers for a term of 21 years .
This gave the settlers a solid claim to their lands but Coppinger soon made it clear that he had no intention of observing the agreement .
Crooke , with his wealth , lands , baronetcy , and influential friends , was personally secure enough , but the Baltimore settlers were subjected to constant harassment . In 1616 Crooke and his fellow settlers brought a lawsuit in the Court of Castle Chamber , the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber , alleging numerous acts of aggression against them : Coppinger was found guilty on one count of riot but cleared of the other charges .
However Castle Chamber was not noted for providing effective remedies for litigants and this verdict did Crooke little good . In 1618 Crooke , despairing of any chance of obtaining justice in the Irish courts , appealed to the Privy Council in London to protect the settlers against Coppinger &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; malicious and covetous desire to supplant them &amp; quot ; both by &amp; quot ; bloody riot &amp; quot ; and by fraudulent claims to their titles .
No firm decision was taken , and Crooke renewed his petition before the new King Charles I in 1626 .
The King , noting that Castle Chamber was apparently divided on the issue , ordered a hearing before Star Chamber .
The case was still proceeding when Crooke died in 1630 ; it seems that the authorities were reluctant to decide finally either in favour of Coppinger or of the settlers . In 1631 Algerian pirates raided Baltimore and carried away more than 100 settlers , who were later sold into slavery in North Africa .
A handful of them were eventually ransomed , but the vast majority never saw Ireland again .
This dealt the town a blow from which it has never really recovered .
Whatever Sir Thomas Crooke &amp; apos ; s faults , most notably the charge , which is still widely believed , that he made Baltimore into a pirate &amp; apos ; s nest , it was his intelligence and energy which had made the town thrive , and , it has been said , it was symbolically appropriate that it should collapse soon after his death . By his wife , Mary , Thomas had three sons : Sir Samuel Crooke , 2nd Baronet , Thomas , a barrister of Gray &amp; apos ; s Inn , who was still living in 1624 ( although he is not mentioned in his father &amp; apos ; s 1629 will ) and James , who was still living in 1634 .
They had at least two daughters : Judith , who married the landowner and writer Sir Vincent Gookin , and a second daughter , who is referred to in her brother Samuel &amp; apos ; s will ( although curiously not in her father &amp; apos ; s ) , who married a Mr Salmon ( this was probably James Salmon of Castlehaven , a prominent local landowner ) .
In his will Thomas refers to his &amp; quot ; son-in-law &amp; quot ; Arthur Jackson : the word son-in-law was then interchangeable with stepson , so Arthur was very likely Lady Crooke &amp; apos ; s son by a previous marriage .
In his own will Arthur refers to Lady Crooke as his mother . Thomas left his estate to his widow , with legacies to his daughter Judith , his stepson Arthur Jackson and his wife Mary , to Thomas &amp; apos ; brothers Samuel , &amp; quot ; dear Helkiah &amp; quot ; and Richard ( &amp; quot ; for his kindness to my children &amp; quot ; ) , his sister Rachel Rosse ( described as &amp; quot ; much impoverished &amp; quot ; ) , who was the wife of Henry Rosse , goldsmith , his &amp; quot ; dear sister in law &amp; quot ; Judith , wife of Samuel , and &amp; quot ; good old Aunt Hudson &amp; quot ; ( who was still living in 1635 ) .

Carl August Petersen , the Chief Engineer of Marketing Construction for Pure Oil , was responsible for the design which was replicated all over the country . By 1945 , there were six gas stations along the four blocks of downtown State Street .
Only two remain — this station and an unnamed station of questionable integrity at 427 State Street .

The brickwork is decoratively skintled ( bricks are irregularly projecting at varying degrees ) .
Most of the building is covered with a steeply pitched gable roof .
It is covered with blue terra cotta tile .
A flat roof covers the south half of the service bays , though it is mostly hidden from view because of the pitched roof .
Three brick chimneys flank the ends of the gables .

Bob Roberts ( singer ) Robert A .
&amp; quot ; Bob &amp; quot ; Roberts ( April 27 , 1879 – January 21 , 1930 ) , sometimes referred to as &amp; quot ; Ragtime &amp; quot ; Bob Roberts , was an American novelty singer in the early years of the 20th century . He was born in Cincinnati , Ohio , the son of Nicholas ( Nick ) Roberts , a well-known clown who became the proprietor of one of the country &amp; apos ; s leading touring pantomime companies .
Bob Roberts is assumed to have traveled widely with his father &amp; apos ; s shows in his youth .
He made his recording debut for Columbia Records in 1902 , and initially recorded remakes of other artists &amp; apos ; records before starting to make recordings of new songs .
Among the most successful of his early recordings for Columbia were &amp; quot ; Hurrah For Baffin &amp; apos ; s Bay &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; By The Sycamore Tree &amp; quot ; , both in 1903 . Roberts also recorded for Edison , Victor , and other companies .
He recorded prolifically , recording some songs for several different labels .
One of his biggest comedy successes was with &amp; quot ; The Woodchuck Song &amp; quot ; , written by Theodore Morse , with a chorus of &amp; quot ; How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood ? &amp; quot ; , which he recorded in 1904 for Edison , Columbia , Victor , and Zon-O-Phone Records .
He also recorded for both Edison and Columbia as part of a duo with Albert Campbell . He was at the peak of his recording career between 1903 and 1907 , when he rivaled Billy Murray for popularity , and received a similar payment of $ 30 for each recording .
He and Murray occasionally recorded together , as on &amp; quot ; Oh ! Oh ! Sallie &amp; quot ; , in 1905 .
Roberts was a leading exponent of the comedic &amp; quot ; coon song &amp; quot ; , such as &amp; quot ; Wouldn &amp; apos ; t It Make You Hungry &amp; quot ; , written by Harry Von Tilzer , and &amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; m Satisfied &amp; quot ; , many of them recorded for Zon-o-phone , a subsidiary of Victor . The number of his recordings started to diminish around 1908 , perhaps because he devoted more of his time to stage performances .
Roberts spent long periods touring in vaudeville , where he became a popular monologist , and was a leading attraction at the Regal Theater in Los Angeles .
However , he also continued to record for Edison , Columbia , Victor , and other labels such as Indestructible . He had further popular success in 1911 with his recording of &amp; quot ; Woodman , Woodman , Spare That Tree &amp; quot ; , from the &amp; quot ; Ziegfeld Follies of 1911 &amp; quot ; , and in 1912 with the earliest recording of &amp; quot ; Ragtime Cowboy Joe &amp; quot ; , for Victor Records .
He did not record for any of the major companies after 1913 but , between 1914 and 1917 , recorded for the Rex Talking Machine Company as Robert Roberts , including a duet with fellow vaudevillian Elida Morris . By the 1920s , Roberts had given up touring and returned to live in Cincinnati .
According to Jim Walsh , he ran a pool hall there , and in the late 1920s appeared on radio station WCKY in a show called &amp; quot ; Adolph and Otto &amp; quot ; . He died in 1930 .

The GoGoFive had a difficult time against him , since Salamandes is now able to transform human souls into energy , powering him up through the &amp; quot ; Psyma Tree &amp; quot ; , which Pierre had grown at an orphanage .
When the long-lost mother of one of the orphaned children that the GoGoFive had befriended arrived , her tears weakened the Psyma Tree &amp; apos ; s power .
Without the soul energy , the GoGoV were able to use the Victory Mars &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; Top Jet &amp; quot ; , the Max Victory Robo &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Max Cannons &amp; quot ; , and the Victory Mars ( after impailing him with its staff ) using &amp; quot ; Mars Flare &amp; quot ; to kill him , leaving only his green gem .

Anne DitchburnAnne Ditchburn ( born October 4 , 1949 ) is a Canadian ballet dancer , choreographer , and film actress , headlining films like 1979 &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Slow Dancing in the Big City &amp; quot ; as a dancer with a crippling disease , a film directed by &amp; quot ; Rocky &amp; quot ; director John G .
Avildsen and co-starring Paul Sorvino .
She also played the doomed ballet dancer Laurian Summers in the 1983 cult horror film &amp; quot ; Curtains &amp; quot ; with John Vernon and Samantha Eggar .
She danced in nearly all of her film credits , and earned a Golden Globe nomination for her work in &amp; quot ; Slow Dancing in the Big City &amp; quot ; .
In her time with the National she choreographed some of its most disguished pieces of the 1970s , including &amp; quot ; Mad Shadows &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Kisses &amp; quot ; , while also heading side company Ballet Revue . Ditchburn was born on October 4 , 1949 , in Sudbury , Ontario .
When she was three , her father moved her , her mother , and her four siblings to Mississauga .
Sensing a natural flair for dancing in his daughter , Ditchburn &amp; apos ; s father began enrolling her in private lessons with Janet Baldwin , who helped her attain her a role in her first major ballet when she was 11 , as &amp; quot ; Gold &amp; quot ; in a 1961 production of &amp; quot ; Hungarian &amp; quot ; .
Baldwin trained her until she was fourteen , when the instructor suggested she audition for the National Ballet School , something Ditchburn later stated was &amp; quot ; the best experience of &amp; # 91 ; her &amp; # 93 ; life &amp; quot ; .
Her first public ballet was at age 19 , when the then National Ballet of Canada artistic director and founder Celia Franca decided to produce Ditchburn &amp; apos ; s own &amp; quot ; Brown Earth &amp; quot ; . Ditchburn was a notable member of the National Ballet of Canada from 1967 to 1979 , where she worked as both a dancer and a prominent choreographer ( one of the few females to do so ) .
She was influenced by the then artistic director Alexander Grant , as well as fellow ballerina Karen Kain . Sometime during the period Ditchburn worked with Ballet Ys to choreograph &amp; quot ; Nelligan &amp; quot ; , with Claudia Moore .
Moore would go on to describe Ditchburn &amp; apos ; s direction as both &amp; quot ; rebellious &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; contemporary &amp; quot ; , a &amp; quot ; thrill &amp; quot ; to see . Her final and most famous role in the company was for the 1977 ballet &amp; quot ; Mad Shadows &amp; quot ; , which she also exclusively choreographed after feuding with fellow choreographer James Kudelka .
The production premiered on February 16 at the O &amp; apos ; Keefe Centre in Toronto and was enormously successful , with a televised version playing at the Royal Opera House , Covent Garden , and the Metropolitan Opera .
Critical reaction was also positive , with Linda Howe-Beck of &amp; quot ; The Gazette &amp; quot ; calling it a &amp; quot ; first-class &amp; quot ; show .
Despite the praise , Ditchburn regarded the piece as &amp; quot ; naive in the international sense &amp; quot ; but still &amp; quot ; appropriate for the time &amp; quot ; . Ditchburn resigned from the company because , as stated in the October 1979 issue of Cinema Canada , she felt that &amp; quot ; my life isn &amp; apos ; t going anywhere fast enough , &amp; quot ; choosing instead to pursue a career as a film actress , as well as freelance choreography .
Other issues revolving around her resignation were creative differences with Alexander Grant , as well as complaints about insufficient facilities and a general low morale though the company .
Fellow National members Karen Kain and Frank Augustyn agreed with the chorepgraphers statements , though remained with the company . For her television and film career , Ditchburn first worked on variety shows , including choreography for the Irish-Canadian band Ryan &amp; apos ; s Fancy on a 1973 episode of Singalong Jubilee , while her first on-screen appearance was on a December 1976 episode of the Peter Gzowski talk show &amp; quot ; 90 Minutes Live &amp; quot ; , where she performed a ballet routine with pianist Andre Gagnon . To obtain the role of dancer Sarah Gantz in &amp; quot ; Slow Dancing &amp; quot ; , it was stated that director John Avildsen had seen a photograph of her dancing and could not get her image out of his head , so he invited her to an audition .
She later stated that her initial audition was a &amp; quot ; disaster &amp; quot ; due to her inexperience in the profession , but she &amp; quot ; gradually improved &amp; quot ; .
Reaction to her performance was mixed , though it did earn her a nomination at the Golden Globe Awards for Best Newcomer .
Ditchburn also choreographed her dance scenes in the film , something she would repeat in the 1982 &amp; quot ; Six Weeks &amp; quot ; and the 1983 film &amp; quot ; Curtains &amp; quot ; , where she had top billing as well as helped choreograph both her own and her co-star Lesleh Donaldson &amp; apos ; s performance scenes . Reaction to her performance in Curtains was mixed , with Cinema Canada &amp; apos ; s Andrew Dowler stating in his review of the film in 1984 that she , as well as several other actresses in the film , was not &amp; quot ; on-screen long enough for me to be certain &amp; # 91 ; she is &amp; # 93 ; in the final print , let alone long enough to develop character . &amp; quot ; In an interview with producer and director Peter Simpson , he stated that &amp; quot ; You know , it &amp; apos ; s a very obvious omission but we should have had more bits of stuff . . .
even short scenes with Anne to pay off her death .
She &amp; apos ; s not in it enough . &amp; quot ; She later worked as a choreographer and a performer in short films like Leonard Cohen &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; I Am a Hotel &amp; quot ; and several shorts by Jurgen Lutz , most famously &amp; quot ; A Moving Picture &amp; quot ; .
Ditchburn also worked as an editor for the 1992 film &amp; quot ; Killer Image &amp; quot ; with Michael Ironside , a creative producer for the 1997 TV movie &amp; quot ; Truth About Lying &amp; quot ; ( or &amp; quot ; Loss of Faith &amp; quot ; ) with John Ritter , and as the production manager for the 1999 film &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
Lutz would later call her a &amp; quot ; gifted dancer , choreographer and author &amp; quot ; . On November 11 , 1979 , two months after her resignation from the National Ballet of Canada , Ditchburn married Ray Wagner .
Wagner , the vice-president of MGM &amp; apos ; s Production Department after the two had met at the last Golden Globes cermoney .
The couple divorced sometime before Wagner &amp; apos ; s death in 2014 .
Making Love ( song ) &amp; quot ; Making Love &amp; quot ; is a 1982 song written by Burt Bacharach , Bruce Roberts , and Carole Bayer Sager , and recorded by Roberta Flack .
It served as the theme song to the film of the same name .
It also appeared on Flack &amp; apos ; s album &amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; m the One &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; Making Love &amp; quot ; peaked at # 13 on the U . S .
&amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; Hot 100 , and was her last Top 40 hit as a solo artist .
It also reached number seven on the Adult Contemporary chart , # 29 R &amp; amp ; B .
It is ranked as the 46th biggest American hit of 1982 . In Canada , the song reached # 43 Pop and # 22 on the Adult Contemporary chart .

He was previously an assistant coach at USC and was the pitching coach for the California Golden Bears from 2000 to 2011 . Hubbs played college baseball at USC and played minor league baseball in the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies organizations . Below is a table of Hubbs &amp; apos ; s yearly records as an NCAA head baseball coach .
Aircraft bridgeAircraft bridges , including taxiway bridges and runway bridges , bring aircraft traffic over motorways , railways , and waterways , and must be designed to support the heaviest aircraft that may cross them .
In 1963 , a taxiway bridge at Chicago O &amp; apos ; Hare Airport , one of the busiest airports in the world , was planned to handle future aircraft weighing , but aircraft weights doubled within two years of its construction .
Currently , the largest passenger aircraft in the world , the Airbus A380 , has a maximum take-off weight ( MTOW ) of .
The largest Boeing planes , i . e .
the current &amp; quot ; Project Ozark &amp; quot ; versions of the Boeing 747-8 , are approaching MTOW of greater than .
Aircraft bridges must be designed for the substantial forces exerted by aircraft braking , affecting the lateral load in substructure design .
Braking force of 70 percent of the live load is assumed in two recent taxiway bridge designs .
And &amp; quot ; deck design is more apt to be controlled by punching shear than flexure due to the heavy wheel loads . &amp; quot ; Taxiway bridges are unusually wide relative to their length , and aircraft loading cannot be assumed to be distributed evenly to a bridge superstructure &amp; apos ; s web , so different modeling is required in these bridges &amp; apos ; structural design .
In cold climates , provisions for anti-icing must be made .
In the U . S . , regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration must be met .
And there are various other differences versus typical bridges covered by AASHTO standards . A major issue is that closing an airport for construction even temporarily is impossible . Major alternatives considered for construction of a taxiway bridge in 2008 were : Finite Element Analysis has been advocated for , or applied in , taxiway bridge design since at least 1963 . The Port Columbus Airport Crossover Taxiway Bridge is an aircraft taxiway bridge at Port Columbus International Airport in Columbus , Ohio that was completed in 2008 .
It is a 24-cell box-girder bridge that spans the primary entrance roadway to the airport terminal .
The taxiway bridge would allow aircraft to travel from the main terminal building to new outer runways of the airport .
The bridge has a single span , is wide and is designed to carry a 747-400 aircraft weighing .
In order to fulfill the load requirements of large aircraft , the bridge design employs a post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete structural system with integral abutments .
To keep the deck free from ice in winter a hydronic anti-icing system consisting of tubes containing glycol from a pump and heater is embedded into the deck . Structural design of the box-girder bridge was guided by two applications of finite modeling .
One modeled the cross-section of the concrete box of the bridge and allowed for aircraft to be placed variously .
This yielded implications for the transverse reinforcement and post-tensioning in the top slab of the concrete box .
A second model yielded implications for the superstructure &amp; apos ; s flexural strength requirements , for connections to the integral abutments , for the two huge abutment walls , and for drilled shafts .
The abutment walls are each long , tall , and from to thick . Lighting requirements specified by the Ohio Department of Transportation are met , and then for aesthetics alone , a system of blue linear lights are integrated into the underside of the bridge and inclined abutments . The entrance roadway spanned by the bridge , named the International Gateway , is a below-grade roadway with seven vehicle lanes and two light rail lines .
Also crossing the International Gateway are two other single-span post-tensioned bridges .
These provide for maintenance and other vehicular traffic around the perimeter of the airport and and wide . The bridge was completed in 2008 .
Architect Miguel Rosales of Boston-based transportation architects Rosales + Partners provided the conceptual design , visualizations and final design .
The Engineer of Record was R . W .
Armstrong .
The construction team included contractor C . J .
Mahan Construction Company , and concrete suppliers Arrow Concrete ( drilled shafts ) and Anderson Concrete ( superstructure and abutments ) . Construction time and cost was saved by a choice of the contractor .
Instead of excavating and then building falsework before casting the superstructure of the bridge , the contractor chose to build it supported by the ground , and then excavate underneath .
This was feasible as the initial ground level was approximately at the level required for the bottom of the planned superstructure . The bridge received the 2008 Portland Cement Association Bridge Award . Taxiway bridges and runway bridges are bridges at airports to bring airplane taxiways and runways across motorways , railroads , or waterways .
A taxiway bridge must be designed to carry the weight of the maximum size airplanes crossing and perhaps stopping directly upon it .
A runway bridge is similar but may have different stresses .
Alternatively , a motorway may be brought by tunnel underneath one or more runways and taxiways . Examples include : Numerous taxiway bridges have been proposed but not built .
Ontario Association of Former ParliamentariansThe Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians ( OAFP ) is a non-profit volunteer organization created to serve former Members of the Ontario Legislative Assembly .
Established by an act of the legislature in 2000 , the objectives of the association are : The association is strictly non-partisan and has former members from all three political parties serving on its board of directors . The association publishes a quarterly newsletter , &amp; quot ; The InFormer &amp; quot ; .
It is developing a variety of educational tools to assist in advancing awareness of the parliamentary form of government .
It also acts as a central clearing house for former members seeking information from various departments of the Legislative Assembly .
The association has formed a relationship with similar groups of former parliamentarians in Quebec and Manitoba and , ultimately , is working towards the development of a global association of former members of state or provincial governments . The current board of directors includes :

Non-monetary economyThe non-monetary economy represents work such as household labor , care giving and civic activity that does not have a monetary value but remains a vitally important part of the economy .
With respect to the current economic situation labor that results in monetary compensation becomes more highly valued than unpaid labor .
Yet nearly half of American productive work goes on outside of the market economy and is not represented in production measures such as the GDP . The non-monetary economy seeks to reward and value work that benefits society ( whether through producing services , products , or making investments ) that the monetary economy does not recognize .
An economic as well as a social imperative drives the work done in this economy .
This method of valuing work would challenge ways in which unemployment and the labor force are all currently measured and generally restructure the way in which labor and work are constructed in America . The non-monetary economy also works to make the labor market more inclusive by valuing previously ignored forms of work .
Some acknowledge the non-monetary economy as having a moral or socially conscious philosophy that attempts to end social exclusion by including poor and unemployed individuals economic opportunities and access to services and goods .
Such community-based and grassroots movements encourage the community to be more participatory , thus providing a more democratic economic structures . Much of non-monetary work is categorized as either civic work or housework .
These two types of work are critical to the operation of daily life and are largely taken for granted and undervalued .
Both of these categories encompass many different types of work and are discussed below . It is important to point the microscope on these two areas because only certain people are very civically engaged and very frequently a certain group of people tend to do housework .
Non-monetary economic systems hope to make community members more active , thus more democratic with more balanced representation , and to value housework that is commonly done by women and less valued . The social economy refers to the space between public and private sectors ( sometimes called the &amp; quot ; third sector &amp; quot ; ) occupied by civil society , including community organizations , volunteering , social enterprises , and cooperatives .
In academic circles the term represents “ a wide family of initiatives and organisational forms – i . e .
a hybridisation of market , non-market ( redistribution ) and non- monetary ( reciprocity ) economies ” .
Rather than being fringe activities at the margins of the formal economy , this amounts to a significant level of activity , as a range of studies indicate .
UK civil society sector for example employs the equivalent of 1 . 4 million full-time employees ( 5 % of the economically active population ) and benefits from the unpaid efforts of the equivalent of 1 . 7 million full-time volunteers ( 5 . 6 % of the economically active population ) , and contributes 6 . 8 % of GDP .
US civil rights litigator and founder of the time bank , Edgar S .
Cahn developed the concept of the core economy to describe the informal social networks that he considered the bedrock of society , which he felt were eroding as monetary economies de-legitimized them .
The core economy as he defined it consists of social capital , and generates collective efficacy that &amp; apos ; s of critical importance to the core economy . &amp; quot ; Collective efficacy &amp; quot ; : Collective efficacy refers to the effectiveness of informal mechanisms by which residents themselves achieve public order .
More specifically , this is the shared vision or fusion of shared willingness of residents to intervene and create social trust ( the sense of engagement and ownership of public spaces ) .
An example may be the willingness of residents to intervene in the lives of other residents to counter crime , increase voting , or encourage residents to recycle .
These informal mechanisms are what he calls &amp; apos ; social capital &amp; apos ; , a public good provided by citizens who participate to build up their communities ( from raising children and taking care of the elderly to volunteer work ) .
This kind of work is essential to a democratic and stable society . &amp; quot ; The Critical Importance of the Core Economy &amp; quot ; : The core economy forms the foundation for a community economy .
Unlike a market economy , the core economy relies on specialization reinforced by a &amp; quot ; do-it-yourself &amp; quot ; attitude that “ Builds self-esteem and a voluntary interdependence that replaces involuntary dependence that comes w / industrial and market specialization ” and where self-sufficiency is based upon interdependent family / community units ( instead of a market economy &amp; apos ; s atomized individual ) .
This model thus purports to reduce and / or eliminate the involuntary dependence that comes with the market economies strict division of labor .
It also focuses on alternative distribution mechanisms to pricing , using instead normative considerations like need , fairness , altruism , moral obligation , or contribution . Collective efficacy and social capital are central to two very successful examples of civic-based , non-monetary economies : time banks and local exchange trading systems ( LETS ) .
These work systems provide alternative forms of currency that are gained through time spent in the community through community gardening , recycling , repairing leaky faucets , babysitting , and other forms of work .
These units of time can be used to ask other members of work systems to do jobs they need or may act as a forum in which special jobs or needs can be communicated and traded .
These systems operate to a large degree outside of the monetary economy but do not negate the importance of a monetary economy or ask to a return to bartering systems . A time bank is a community-based organization which brings people and local organizations together to help each other , utilizing previously untapped resources and skills , valuing work which is normally unrewarded , and valuing people who find themselves marginalized from the conventional economy .
These are things that family or friends might normally do for each other , but in the absence of supportive reciprocal networks , the time bank recreates those connections .
These interactions are based upon the exchange of hours spent on an activity , where time dollars are the unit of measure / currency .
They are traded for hours of labour , and are redeemable for services from other members .
There are two main types of bank structure : &amp; quot ; Neighbor-to-neighbor &amp; quot ; : These time banks involve individuals in the same neighborhood . &amp; quot ; Specialized &amp; quot ; : These time banks either limit membership ( for example , students within a school district , or members within an organization ) or the scope of activities ( like tutoring or babysitting ) . Benefits of time banks include that : &amp; quot ; The Household Economy &amp; quot ; : In 1998 non-profit organization Redefining Progress estimated that housework amounted to $ 1 . 911 trillion , roughly a fourth of the U . S .
GDP that year .
As of 2010 , the Bureau of Economic Analysis found that household work would increase GDP by 26 % .
More than a decade later , household work continues to provide a key source of foundational support to the domestic economy .
Such household work includes cleaning , cooking , care giving , and educating children among others . The household economy may incite the idea of an intimate group of individuals that benefit from the work done in the home , a closed household economy .
One can argue in numerous ways that the household economy where goods can be traded and services can be shared or traded .
This type of economy exists today and benefits the community at large . In extreme cases of survival the open nature of the household economy is most evident .
Sharing of foods , clothes items , toiletries , and basic necessities were often shared or exchanged amongst war-torn , impoverished families in East Europe post-communism .
Cooking , cleaning , clothes-making , and forms of work may seem to be intuitively thought of as work .
Not all work done within the home is seen as work .
When labor is enjoyable such as watching movie with one ’ s children , exercising , or entertaining the activities may not readily be seen as work .
Yet an estimated 380 million hours are spent on these types of unpaid activities ( work ) and 272 million hours per week are spent doing paid work as found in 1992 from a sample of research participants in Australia ( these hours are the aggregate hours of all Australians ) . A large portion of these hours can be attributed to nurturing .
Nurturing can take two forms in terms of raising children and nursing the sick , elderly , and infirm both kinds of which both types of work are still moderately gendered types of work .
Children represent not only a product of a household but an asset to the community as a whole .
In the home , kids may provide help in the form of chores and so are an asset to other members of the household .
However , a larger argument can be made that children are a public good .
Children are an investment in which time , energy , and money are spent on children so that they can become stable adults who contribute to reducing national debt and contributing to Social Security , thus a public good .
Children not only act as economic investments but also have great utility to society as plumbers , mathematicians , sociologists , botanists , postal workers , and whatever profession or products they produce in the future . The products and services produced within a home are open to the non-market economy at large .
Society as a whole benefits from this unpaid work whether in a tangible manner or a more abstract , macro scale .
The other form of nurturing done within the home , caregiving , also serves as a benefit to society as a whole . &amp; quot ; Care giving &amp; quot ; : Care giving refers to providing assistance for those who are elderly , disabled , suffer terminal illness , chronic illness , or are generally frail or in need of assistance .
Someone who cares for someone in any of these positions is a caregiver .
This kind of assistance is largely unpaid and conducted by friends and / or family of the patient . Care giving often exceeds the nursing tasks that come with caring for someone who is ill or recovering from surgery .
Often , caregivers also must clean the occupancy of the patient , provide meals , and speak with medical providers , doctors , among other responsibilities . To put the extent of work performed in the non-monetary economy into context , nearly 80 % of labor that keeps seniors out of nursing homes is unpaid labor by families . In 1997 , estimates predicted that the value of work produced by caregivers amounted to $ 196 billion .
Current estimates put the value of work at $ 375 billion for 2007 .
At the time , only $ 32 billion spent on formal health care and $ 83 billion spent on nursing home care by the federal government .
According to these statistics , only half as much money is spent on nursing and home health care as is necessary .
These numbers do not take into account the financial burden as well as emotion work that is an inescapable part of this work . The same research estimated that in 1997 , caregivers would have received $ 8 . 18 as the hourly wage by averaging the national minimum wage and the median was for Home Health Aides .
As of May 2013 , the hourly wage can be estimated at $ 9 . 14 when averaging the minimum wage in Florida and the median wage for Home Health Aides .
Caregiving requires a large dedication , as much as 22 to 70 hours a week .
Most incredible is the number of people performing this work , an estimated 25 . 8 million people as of 1997 . It is also important to note that caregiving has a disproportionate affect on women and white households .
The cost of caregiving is exorbitant , nearly 5 times what Medicaid would have spent on long term care , meaning only wealthy families can afford to do this type of in-home care .
The intersection of class and race in this phenomenon is an important place to explore as less advantaged families will have to rely on government care , potentially at the risk of having less quality care .
These statistics also highlight a differential effect on women , showing that women disproportionately do caregiving work . Understanding the non-monetary economy is important for a number of reasons .
Valuing all work changes perceptions of valuable work .
Acknowledging a non-monetary economy may potentially change the ways in which the unemployed , poor , women , and other stigmatized persons ’ work is valued .
It can allow citizens to see their community as a more cohesive , intertwined system that deserves their time and energy .
Exploring this economy also exposes numerous areas of help that do not have enough support from the public and private sectors .
Education and caregiving in particular highlight were assistance is needed and often not provided . Barter Economies also constitute an important form of non-monetized interaction , although for the most part this kind of interaction is viewed largely as a temporary fix as an economic system is in transition .
It is also usually considered a side effect of a tight monetary policy , such as in a liquidity crisis like that of 1990s Russia where barter transactions in Russia accounted for an astonishing 50 percent of sales for midsize enterprises and 75 percent for large ones . The UK in particular has been targeted by the government since the New Labor administration of the mid-1990s onwards — the social economy has been developed as a means of delivering effective public services , and mobilizing active citizenship .
In 2002 , for example , the Department for Trade and Industry ( DTI ) 2002 launched the Strategy for Social Enterprise to develop “ the government ’ s vision . . .
of dynamic and sustainable social enterprise strengthening an inclusive and growing economy ” , which aims to create an enabling policy environment for social enterprise , make social enterprises better businesses , and establish the value of social enterprise , in order that the sector may help to deliver on a range of policy agendas : productivity and competitiveness ; contributing to socially inclusive wealth creation ; neighborhood regeneration ; public service reform ; and developing an inclusive society and active citizenship . However , by and large current policy does not reflect the implications of a system that does not validate actions that transmit community values , provide support , generates consensus , etc .
These actions in the past were subsidized by cheap or free labor derived from subordinate groups , like women and ethnic / racial minorities , who as a result of entering the workforce to receive monetary validation negate these positive public goods . The biggest issue that time bank coordinators face , as a result , is funding .
Time banks do not rely on volunteers , but require financial support to pay the time broker ’ s salary , for a publicly accessible drop-in office , for marketing costs , etc .
for time banks to successfully attract socially excluded people in deprived neighborhoods .
Many UK time banks have been supported by grant funding from the National Lottery , over time it becomes harder to secure ongoing funding , or to increase the funding available for time banks overall , and established projects close while new ones are begun elsewhere . Tax exemptions for organizations that administer time banks , barter networks , or currencies consider them 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) ( making it a tax-exempt non-profit ) , whereby a nonprofit organization is exempt from federal income tax if its activities have the following purposes : charitable , religious , educational , scientific , literary , testing for public safety , fostering amateur sports competition , or preventing cruelty to children or animals .
The IRS has recognized some time banks as tax exempt ; it is harder to obtain exemptions for a barter network or local currency , as they are harder to prove as operating purely on a basis of service to the community . Being a time bank , alone , does not enable an organization to obtain tax exemption under 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) .
If , instead of a time bank , an organization operates a local currency or barter network , such an organization may be deemed to be operating for the private benefit of individuals , even if those individuals are members of a charitable class .
Grounds for 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) considerations include
St Aidan &amp; apos ; sSt Aidan &amp; apos ; s is a 400 hectare Country Park between Leeds and Castleford in West Yorkshire , England .
The land was formerly an opencast coal mining area that was flooded after the riverbank collapsed .
Repairs and remediation required its own act in Parliament to allow the necessary works to go ahead .
Mining ceased at St Aidan &amp; apos ; s in 2002 . The Country Park opened to the public in May 2013 under the care of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) .
However , the car park and visitor centre were subsequently closed in July 2013 due to unresolved land issues .
With the successful transfer of St Aidan &amp; apos ; s to Leeds City Council , a 99-year lease was signed from the council to the RSPB in March 2017 .
The site is now open and functioning as an RSPB reserve .
It is open every day excluding Christmas Day with the visitor centre open from 9am to 5pm February – October and 9am to 4pm November – January . RSPB St Aidan &amp; apos ; s Nature Park is designed for both people and wildlife and is open for a wide range of activities , from bird watching , cycling and walking to jogging , horse riding and dog walking . St Aidan &amp; apos ; s Country Park comprises the former St Aidan &amp; apos ; s opencast site , Lowther North opencast site and parts of the former Savile Colliery , Methley .
In March 1988 , there was a slope failure on the banks of the River Aire , resulting in a massive flood of of water .
Mining operations were suspended and remedial works costing £ 20 million were required to drain the site and re-route the river .
The resultant deluge created a lake that was in size and deep .
RAF Chinook helicopters were used to ferry sandbags into the breach , but it did not stop the water cascading in .
Not only did the downstream river flow into the site , but the River Calder actually flowed upstream in the River Aire waterbed from Castleford until the water found a natural level .
Government documentation states that it was the Aire and Calder Navigation , whilst others list the Aire as being the source of the water that flooded St Aidan &amp; apos ; s .
The failure came about just south east of Lemonroyd Lock where the two waterways converge .
Mining was subsequently completed and then the site was converted into a wetland . The Pontefract and District Archaeological Society won the Pitt Rivers award for their work on the preservation of the ships and heritage that was found in the abandoned river bed after the water was diverted .
The find provided a unique insight into river trade in the seventeenth century onwards , including the hulls of four boats ( virtually intact ) , various pottery and evidence of a medieval weir . Ownership of the land was transferred in 2010 from UK Coal / Harworth Estates to St Aidan &amp; apos ; s Trust , a charity administered by Leeds City Council .
The trust would then lease the land to the RSPB for 99 years on a peppercorn rent .
The Country Park officially opened to the public on 25 May 2013 .
Unfortunately , due to unresolved land ownership issues , the RSPB withdrew its staffing and support in July 2013 .
As of 21 December 2016 ownership of St Aidan &amp; apos ; s was successfully passed from Harworth Estates to the St Aidan &amp; apos ; s Trust ( of which Leeds city council is the sole trustee ) .
RSPB were then given confirmation that the site would be leased to them on a 99-year lease in March 2017 .
The site was reopened in April 2017 and RSPB now have control of the management of the site and the reopening of the car park , visitor centre and visitor operations . St Aidan &amp; apos ; s is adjacent to the River Aire and the Aire and Calder Navigation .
The reserve can be accessed via a network of paths , some of which run alongside the River Aire .
It is approximately 2 miles from Woodlesford railway station .
Nearby are the residential areas of Allerton Bywater , Mickletown , Methley , Woodlesford , Swillington and Great Preston , all of which lie within an area bounded by three motorways : A1 ( M ) , M62 and M1 . The main trails at St Aidan &amp; apos ; s take you amongst a variety of habitats including reedbed , wetland , meadows and woodland .
St Aidan &amp; apos ; s is home to many species of bird including the Eurasian bittern , little owl , western marsh harrier , and Eurasian skylark .
Breeding birds on the reserve include one of the rarest in the UK , black-necked grebe with around 25 % of the national population which nest , for protection , near the one-thousand pairs of black-headed gull .
Northern lapwing and common redshank also breed . There is a dragline known as &amp; quot ; Oddball &amp; quot ; at St Aidan &amp; apos ; s .
Oddball , whose name refers to it having been built in the US to run on a 60 Hz electrical supply rather than the UK standard 50 Hz , was brought to K from the US in 1946 and weighs 1220 tons .
The group &amp; quot ; Friends of St .
Aidan &amp; apos ; s BE1150 Dragline &amp; quot ; claim that it is the largest preserved walking dragline excavator in Western Europe .
The excavator was originally christened &amp; quot ; Clinchfield &amp; quot ; and was used to surface mine coal from the area now occupied by St Aidan &amp; apos ; s Country Park . The group hold &amp; apos ; open days &amp; apos ; throughout the year where visitors can look around the machine and sit in the cab .
Oliver CheshireOliver Luke Cheshire ( born 3 June 1988 ) is an English male fashion model . Cheshire was scouted by Select Model Management at 15 years of age while studying drama .
Soon after Cheshire became an overnight success as the new face for Calvin Klein .
Cheshire gave up drama studies for a career as a model .
In 2008 he did an advertising campaign for Jack Wills in Rajasthan , India .
Cheshire has also modelled for Dolce &amp; amp ; Gabbana , Missoni , Abercrombie &amp; amp ; Fitch , Hollister , Vivienne Westwood , Gap and Marks and Spencer . Marks and Spencer announced a 50 % increase in the sale of men &amp; apos ; s swimwear whilst Cheshire was fronting their campaign .
He has reported on Men &amp; apos ; s Fashion Week for &amp; quot ; GQ &amp; quot ; magazine and writes a fashion blog in his spare time .
In 2015 , he was named one of &amp; quot ; GQ &amp; quot ; s 50 best dressed British men .
In an interview with iNews , Cheshire admitted that being a model is not as exciting as some people would think .
He had chances traveling to beautiful places and wearing expensive suits .
But these are for working purposes only .
He said &amp; quot ; Usually I ’ m walking to Sainsbury ’ s wearing a pair of horrible tracksuit bottoms and a hat .
I do get flown to all these amazing places but sometimes you only see the inside of a studio before you ’ re flown home again . ” He notices that in fashion modelling is one of the few industries where women get substantially higher pay than men .
But he has long accepted it as a way the business works and won &amp; apos ; t lodge any complaint on it . Cheshire has been in a relationship with singer-songwriter Pixie Lott , reportedly since 2010 .
The pair got engaged in November 2016 .
USS LST-594USS &amp; quot ; LST-594 &amp; quot ; was an , built for the United States Navy during World War II .
The &amp; quot ; LST &amp; quot ; stands for Landing Ship , Tank , while &amp; quot ; USS &amp; quot ; stands for United States Ship .
&amp; quot ; LST-594 &amp; quot ; was part of the second wave of LSTs , denoted LST Mk . 2s , which began production in 1943 , replacing the earlier Mk . 1 version .
Within the Mk . 2 version , there were three classes : LST-1 , LST-491 and LST-542 .
USS &amp; quot ; LST-594 &amp; quot ; was a member of the 542 class , which had several operational and armament upgrades over the prior classes . Construction of &amp; quot ; LST-594 &amp; quot ; began on July 1 , 1944 , when her keel was laid down at Evansville , Indiana by the Missouri Valley Bridge &amp; amp ; Iron Company ( MVB &amp; amp ; I ) .
MVB &amp; amp ; I was one of five major inland shipbuilders , and , with International Steel Company ( also located in Evansville ) , contributed the greatest number of LST &amp; apos ; s to the American war effort .
Completed in 43 days , she was launched on August 12 , 1944 , and was sponsored by Mrs .
Everett B .
Wiley .
She was commissioned September 6 , 1944 , with Lt .
Edgar Y .
M .
Henderson , USNR , in command . The ship was assigned to the Asiatic Pacific Theater .
For her efforts , &amp; quot ; LST-594 &amp; quot ; was honored with the American Campaign Medal , Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal , World War II Victory Medal , Navy Occupation Service Medal ( with Asia clasp ) , and the Philippines Liberation Medal . Following the end of World War II , &amp; quot ; LST-594 &amp; quot ; performed occupation duty in the Far East .
She also saw service in China until mid-February 1946 .
She was decommissioned on February 21 , 1946 , and struck from the United States Navy list on March 5 , 1947 .
On June 4 , 1947 , &amp; quot ; LST-594 &amp; quot ; was sold to the government of South Korea .
Her final fate is unknown . The 542 class of LSTs , of which &amp; quot ; LST-594 &amp; quot ; was one , was the third step in the evolution of Mk . 2 LSTs .
Changes in the later &amp; quot ; LST-542 &amp; quot ; class included the addition of a navigation bridge , the installation of a water distillation plant with a capacity of 4,000 gallons per day , the removal of the tank deck ventilator tubes from the center section of the main deck , the strengthening of the main deck to carry a smaller Landing Craft Tank ( LCT ) , and an upgrade in armor and armament , with the addition of a 3 &amp; quot ; / 50 caliber gun .
Melba CollegeMelba Secondary College otherwise simply known as &amp; quot ; Melba College &amp; quot ; is a secondary college in Melbourne &amp; apos ; s far eastern suburbs .
Melba has a student population of approximately 750 students , divided across the campuses .
The senior campus being located on Brentnall Road and the junior campus located on Croydon Road . The move towards a merger was made in 2009 with a decision being made to regenerate City of Maroondah &amp; apos ; s secondary education .
A merger was planned between Maroondah and Croydon Secondary Colleges .
Despite poor community feedback around the merger , plans and a site study were completed to build a new school on the Maroondah site .
The project was not funded in the 2010 / 2011 Victorian State Budget . Despite the projects funding approval Croydon Secondary College and Maroondah Secondary College ceased operations at the end of the 2011 school year .
They merged under the temporary name &amp; apos ; Croydon-Maroondah Secondary College &amp; apos ; for the start of the 2012 school year and continued operating at their respective campuses . The merger brought together Croydon Secondary College , Maroondah Secondary College and the then closed Parkwood Secondary College . Melba Secondary College was then officially established with the Victorian Department of Education in January 2013 . The school was listed for upgrade in the 2015 / 2016 Victorian State Budget as part of a $ 217 million statewide school upgrades project . The school competes within the School Sport Victoria ( SSV ) Maroondah Division , Eastern Metropolitan Region and State Levels for sporting events and carnivals such as athletics , swimming , cross-country and team sports . The school has a strong music program with it school band participating in Melbourne &amp; apos ; s ANZAC Day Parade annually . The College is named after Australia Opera Soprano Dame Nellie Melba .
TrawsCymruTrawsCymru is the brand for a network of seven medium and long distance express bus routes in Wales , sponsored by the Welsh Government .
It was introduced as a replacement for the TrawsCambria network . In 2010 the Welsh Assembly Government ran a consultation on improvements to the TrawsCambria network .
In 2011 , a programme of improvements for TrawsCambria services ( Carmarthen - Pencader - Lampeter - Aberaeron - Aberystwyth ) and / T4 ( Newtown - Brecon / Merthyr ) was announced . Under these plans services X40 and T4 , and the network as a whole , were to be re-launched under the new TrawsCymru brand .
Service X40 was to be re-numbered TC1 and T4 would have become TC4 , along with extension south to Cardiff .
During 2012 , these two routes were to receive new Optare Tempos equipped with coach style seating , greater luggage space , real time information and WiFi . The plans for re-numbering T4 were dropped , but the new vehicles and extension to Cardiff were introduced .
The six additional WAG-funded Optare Tempos with leather seats , free WiFi and tables operate alongside the existing three Optare Tempos that had previously worked the T4 service . The X40 was originally scheduled to be replaced by TrawsCymru service T1 / TC1 from 1 April 2012 under a contract until 31 March 2020 on offer .
However it later emerged that Arriva Buses Wales intended to stop operating the X40 service , along with its share of route 550 , from 26 February .
Instead Arriva introduced services branded Cymru Express on a fully commercial basis in place of the former TrawsCambria X40 . Because of the commercial CymruExpress , the TC1 TrawsCymru service could not be introduced .
The six new buses that had been ordered to operate the TC1 were thus placed into store .
These were longer than the new vehicles for the TC4 , so were later taken out of storage and put to use on the T4 service , to increase capacity .
They replaced three of the vehicles that had been ordered for the TC4 , which joined the remaining three unused vehicles which had been intended for the TC1 in store .
In August 2013 , the Welsh Government launched an express bus service between Cardiff Central station and Cardiff Airport .
This was branded as a TrawsCymru route , given the number T9 .
Five of the six TrawsCymru buses were taken out of storage to operate this service , later being joined by the sixth . Arriva &amp; apos ; s CymruExpress services ceased on 21 December 2013 , meaning a TrawsCymru service between Aberystwyth and Carmarthen was once again a possibility .
Interim contracts to continue bus services on the route were let pending the introduction of a TrawsCymru service . In July 2013 , it emerged that Welsh Government transport minister Edwina Hart had commissioned a review of the TrawsCymru network .
This was to be undertaken by Dr Victoria Winckler , director of the Bevan Foundation think tank This outcome of this review was published by the Welsh Government in February 2014 . Dr Winckler &amp; apos ; s report defined the purpose of TrawsCymru as a network of medium-to-long-distance ( defined as 25 miles or more ) , strategically important , bus services that connect key towns in Wales and which complement the rail network in Wales . The report &amp; apos ; s recommendations included : During 2014 , the roll-out of the TrawsCymru brand to the other TrawsCambria corridors finally began .
The first route to appear was the Carmarthen-Aberystwyth route , but the original plan for the service to become known as TC1 has been dropped .
The TrawsCymru service was instead launched under the service number T1 , in August 2014 .
Unlike the T4 and T9 TrawsCymru contracts , the operator provides vehicles for the T1 , rather than using vehicles owned by the Welsh Government .
It remains to be seen how the vehicles used will compare to the Welsh Government owned ones on the other routes . Invitations To Tender were also published for the remaining three TrawsCambria routes ( Aberystwyth-Cardigan ) , ( Bangor-Aberystwyth ) and ( Wrexham-Barmouth ) , to be known as T5 , T2 and T3 respectively .
The X94 became the T3 in November 2014 , and the X50 the T5 in January 2015 .
The T2 contract was expected to start in 2014 , but due to last minute registrations of commercial workings by the incumbent operators ended up being let as a short term extension without TrawsCymru branding .
In November 2015 , the T2 was finally launched with branded buses in due course .
Lloyds Coaches have ordered three Optare MetroCitys with the first two due in January 2016 and the third due in March 2016 . The T1 service commenced operating on 4 August 2014 .
An hourly service is provided Monday to Saturday with a few Sunday journeys .
A late evening working also operates , between Aberystwyth and Lampeter .
A single service number is used , but buses take two different routes between Pencader and Lampeter in order to serve intermediate villages every two hours ( prior to the T1 launch , one village had an hourly bus service and the other nothing ) . The T1 is operated by First Cymru using standard buses from their existing fleet in TrawsCymru livery ; many duties are subcontracted to Mid Wales Travel drivers .
From August 2014 to July 2016 they used two Alexander Dennis Enviro200s and three Alexander Dennis Enviro300s , and from July 2016 to present they use five Enviro300s .
Since December 2016 a Wright Eclipse Urban bodied Volvo B7RLE has also been T1 liveried and allocated . Journey time for the T1 is 2 hours 15 minutes .
According to Dr Winckler &amp; apos ; s review , the journey time by car is 1 hour 25 minutes , meaning the bus service takes 58 % longer than driving and hence misses the target set by the review . From 5 December 2016 to 14 April 2018 , First Cymru operated the T1C service using the T1 fleet , which was then a once per day ( except Sundays ) extension of the T1 to Swansea and Cardiff , introduced as a replacement for the more frequent 701 service which had ceased operating in August 2016 when its final operator , Lewis Coaches , ceased trading .
The full journey time of the combined T1 &amp; amp ; T1C service when operated by First Cymru was 4 hours 35 minutes . From 16 April 2018 , NAT Group took over operation of the T1C service .
Though still once per day , the use of a separate Aberystwyth to Cardiff service by coach ( in this case a Mercedes-Benz Tourismo bodied Mercedes-Benz OC 500 RF ) and Sunday operation both resumed , neither of which had been seen since the 701 .
The T1C as operated by NAT Group takes advantage of being a separate service to the T1 by bypassing Lampeter , Llanybydder , and from Monday to Saturday , Swansea , taking an hour off the full journey time which is now 3 hours 35 minutes . The T1S service also commenced operation by First Cymru on 16 April 2018 using the T1 fleet .
The T1S provides connections at Carmarthen for passengers travelling between Aberystwyth and Swansea on Monday to Saturday , has an approximate full journey time of 1 hour and additionally serves the National Botanic Garden of Wales once per day in either direction . The T2 service is operated by Lloyds Coaches ( formerly Lloyds Coaches and Express Motors until the latter &amp; apos ; s closure in January 2018 ) and runs twice a day from Bangor to Aberystwyth , with additional workings over part of the route on Mondays to Saturdays .
This service was introduced towards the end of September 2012 , when Arriva Buses Wales cancelled .
The T2 would have been the second TrawsCymru service launched but its status as a TrawsCymru service was dubious for many years as although the operators referred to the service as TrawsCymru from the start they did not have any TrawsCymru branded vehicles for use on the service .
Instead , they used buses in their own standard liveries .
In March 2016 , the service was upgraded with four TrawsCymru branded Optare MetroCitys . In January 2018 , one of those MetroCities , which was the one owned by Express Motors , was replaced by a brand new one owned by Lloyds Coaches . The T3 service commenced operating on 2 November 2014 .
A more frequent Monday to Saturday service is provided compared to the previous it replaces along with improved connections with the T2 service in Dolgellau .
GHA Coaches were awarded a seven-year contract to operate the service , initially with existing buses ( one single deck Scania OmniCity of which was TrawsCymru liveried ) before taking delivery of three Alexander Dennis Enviro400 bodied Scania N230UDs and an Alexander Dennis Enviro200 , all fitted with Wi-Fi and leather seats in 2015 .
Journey time is 2 hours 30 minutes .
Following the collapse of GHA Coaches in July 2016 , the service was immediately taken over by Lloyds Coaches . The T4 was the first TrawsCymru service to be launched on 31 May 2011 and is operated by Stagecoach South Wales , who also operated the previous TrawsCambria 704 ( which operated between Newtown and Brecon only ) . The service as launched was operated with nine Optare Tempos , branded TrawsCymru , three of which had been ordered and used on the and were repainted into TrawsCymru livery .
The other six were new vehicles introduced to extend the service to Cardiff .
The new vehicles are to an enhanced standard with a new design of seat and WiFi . The three ageing former TrawsCambria Optare Tempos were finally retired in May to June 2017 after more than a decade of service , and replaced with three transferred two-year-old Alexander Dennis Enviro300 bodied Scania K230UBs , which has somewhat ironically made the six &amp; quot ; newer &amp; quot ; Optare Tempos that remain on the service the older vehicles . The service is the longest end-to-end journey on the TrawsCymru network , with a journey time of 3 hours 50 minutes . The T5 was commenced on 5 January 2015 .
Roughly hourly departures are provided from Aberystwyth , Cardigan , Fishguard and Haverfordwest but the service is made up of a number of different routes , the most frequent being : Additionally : Shortly before the service launched , the TrawsCymru website was updated to include the service , with the statement : &amp; quot ; The TrawsCymru T5 provides a regular and direct service along the scenic Cambrian Coast , linking Aberystwyth , Aberaeron , New Quay , Cardigan , Fishguard and Haverfordwest . &amp; quot ; This is inaccurate because not all journeys serve New Quay and the inclusion of Fishguard and ( on some trips ) New Quay and Aberporth means the service is by no means direct .
The website also reported that the service operates 7 days per week , when in fact there are no services between 03 : 00 on Sundays and 05 : 45 on Mondays ( effectively no Sunday service ) .
By 8 January 2015 , this latter error had been corrected to say that the service operates 6 days per week . The service was initially operated with existing buses , including four former TrawsCambria Optare Tempos , and four VDL SB200s ( two with Wright Pulsar 2 bodies , one with an old-style Wright Pulsar body and one with an MCV Evolution body registered as YJ14CCV , which is a one-off , as it is an ex-demonstrator that only received orders on other chassis ) .
All of these vehicles received TrawsCymru livery and seating , and in 2015 were joined by four new Optare MetroCitys .
While the Tempos remain on the service , the fact that they are ageing former TrawsCambria examples ( same as the older T4 ones withdrawn in 2017 ) as opposed to the newer ones used on the T4 and T9 , means that the MetroCitys and SB200s are somewhat prioritised . The T9 service commenced operating on 1 August 2013 .
It was initially operated by First Cymru and ran every 20 minutes , 7 days a week .
Five Optare Tempos are allocated to the service .
The buses used were reported to be those ordered for the Carmarthen - Aberystwyth TC1 service .
On 1 November 2014 New Adventure Travel took over operation of the route , which was reduced to a half-hourly .
It was restored to a 20 minutes frequency in April 2015 . At around 15 miles , the route falls some way short of the 25 mile minimum distance given in Dr Victoria Winckler &amp; apos ; s review of TrawsCymru ( see sub-section of history section above ) .
The journey time from Cardiff Airport to Cardiff Central is 40 minutes .
Due to the circular route via Cardiff Bay , the journey from Cardiff Central to the airport is only 30 minutes . A number of services have been designated as &amp; quot ; TrawsCymru Connect &amp; quot ; in timetables but they are not mentioned on the TrawsCymru website and the vehicles used did carry any special livery or branding until late 2017 when Richards Bros &amp; apos ; Optare Versa and their brand new Enviro200 received the TrawsCymru Connect livery .
As of February 2018 , First Cymru have had the TrawsCymru Connect livery applied to one of their Enviro200s .

Olof HannerOlof Hanner ( 7 December 1922 in Stockholm – 19 September 2015 in Gothenburg ) was a Swedish mathematician . Hanner earned his Ph . D .
from Stockholm University in 1952 .
He was a professor at the University of Gothenburg from 1963 to 1989 . In a 1956 paper , Hanner introduced the Hanner polytopes and the Hanner spaces having these polytopes as their metric balls .
Hanner was interested in a Helly property of these shapes , later used to characterize them by : unlike other convex polytopes , it is not possible to find three translated copies of a Hanner polytope that intersect pairwise but do not have a point of common intersection .
Subsequently , the Hanner polytopes formed a class of important examples for the Mahler conjecture and for Kalai &amp; apos ; s 3 conjecture .
In another paper from the same year , Hanner proved a set of inequalities related to the uniform convexity of &amp; quot ; L &amp; quot ; spaces , now known as Hanner &amp; apos ; s inequalities . Other contributions of Hanner include ( with Hans Rådström ) improving Werner Fenchel &amp; apos ; s version of Carathéodory &amp; apos ; s lemma , contributing to &amp; quot ; The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge &amp; quot ; , and doing early work on combinatorial game theory and the mathematics of the board game Go .
One of the many proofs of the Pythagorean theorem based on the Pythagorean tilingis sometimes called &amp; quot ; Olof Hanner &amp; apos ; s Jigsaw Puzzle &amp; quot ; .

His father , George Stapleton , was the second son of Sir Bryan Stapleton by Joan or Jane Lovell , the daughter of John Lovell , 8th Baron Lovell ( d . 1464 ) , and sister of Francis Lovell , 1st Viscount Lovell . In her 1537 will Elizabeth ( née Scrope ) , Dowager Countess of Oxford , bequeathed Anthony Stapleton ten pounds ‘ towards his learning at the common law ’ .
He was educated at the Inner Temple , and was active in its affairs throughout his life .
He &amp; apos ; rarely missed a parliament &amp; apos ; of the Inner Temple , was Reader in 1543 , 1544 , and 1553 , &amp; apos ; and held the highest offices &amp; apos ; , serving as Treasurer during the years 1555-7 , and as Governor in 1555 and 1566 .
Among his legal clients were Henry Percy , 5th Earl of Northumberland ; his paternal uncle , Sir Brian Stapleton ; John de Vere , 16th Earl of Oxford , whose will he witnessed in 1548 ; and the Dean and Chapter of Westminster , who paid him a retainer of 40s a year .

Lorentz-violating electrodynamicsSearches for Lorentz violation involving photons are among the best tests of relativity .
Examples range from modern versions of the classic Michelson-Morley experiment that utilize highly stable electromagnetic resonant cavities to searches for tiny deviations from &amp; quot ; c &amp; quot ; in the speed of light emitted by distant astrophysical sources .
Due to the extreme distances involved , astrophysical studies have achieved sensitivities on the order of parts in 10 . The most general framework for studies of relativity violations is an effective field theory called the Standard-Model Extension ( SME ) .
Lorentz-violating operators in the SME are classified by their mass dimension formula _ 1 .
To date , the most widely studied limit of the SME is the minimal SME , which limits attention to operators of renormalizable mass-dimension , formula _ 2 , in flat spacetime .
Within the minimal SME , photons are governed by the lagrangian densityThe first term on the right-hand side is the conventional Maxwell lagrangian and gives rise to the usual source-free Maxwell equations .
The next term violates both Lorentz and CPT invariance and is constructed from a dimension formula _ 4 operator and a constant coefficient for Lorentz violation formula _ 5 .
The second term introduces Lorentz violation , but preserves CPT invariance .
It consists of a dimension formula _ 6 operator contracted with constant coefficients for Lorentz violation formula _ 7 .
There are a total of four independent formula _ 5 coefficients and nineteen formula _ 7 coefficients .
Both Lorentz-violating terms are invariant under observer Lorentz transformations , implying that the physics in independent of observer or coordinate choice .
However , the coefficient tensors formula _ 5 and formula _ 7 are outside the control of experimenters and can be viewed as constant background fields that fill the entire Universe , introducing directionality to the otherwise isotropic spacetime .
Photons interact with these background fields and experience frame-dependent effects , violating Lorentz invariance . The mathematics describing Lorentz violation in photons is similar to that of conventional electromagnetism in dielectrics .
As a result , many of the effects of Lorentz violation are also seen in light passing through transparent materials .
These include changes in the speed that can depend on frequency , polarization , and direction of propagation .
Consequently , Lorentz violation can introduce dispersion in light propagating in empty space .
It can also introduce birefringence , an effect seen in crystals such as calcite .
The best constraints on Lorentz violation come from constraints on birefringence in light from astrophysical sources . The full SME incorporates general relativity and curved spacetimes .
It also includes operators of arbitrary ( nonrenormalizable ) dimension formula _ 12 .
The general gauge-invariant photon sector was constructed in 2009 by Kostelecky and Mewes .
It was shown that the more general theory could be written in a form similar to the minimal case , where the constant coefficients are promoted to operators formula _ 14 and formula _ 15 , which take the form of power series in spacetime derivatives .
The formula _ 14 operator contains all the CPT-odd formula _ 17 terms , while the CPT-even terms with formula _ 18 are in formula _ 15 .
While the nonrenormalizable terms give many of the same types of signatures as the formula _ 2 case , the effects generally grow faster with frequency , due to the additional derivatives .
More complex directional dependence typically also arises .
Vacuum dispersion of light without birefringence is another feature that is found , which does not arise in the minimal SME . Birefringence of light occurs when the solutions to the modified Lorentz-violating Maxwell equations give rise to polarization-dependent speeds .
Light propagates as the combination of two orthogonal polarizations that propagate at slightly different phase velocities .
A gradual change in the relative phase results as one of the polarizations outpaces the other .
The total polarization ( the sum of the two ) evolves as the light propagates , in contrast to the Lorentz-invariant case where the polarization of light remains fixed when propagating in a vacuum .
In the CPT-odd case ( &amp; quot ; d &amp; quot ; = odd ) , birefringence causes a simple rotation of the polarization .
The CPT-even case ( &amp; quot ; d &amp; quot ; = even ) gives more complicated behavior as linearly polarized light evolves into elliptically polarizations . The quantity determining the size of the effect is the change in relative phase , formula _ 21 , where formula _ 22 is the difference in phase speeds , formula _ 23 is the propagation time , and formula _ 24 is the wavelength .
For formula _ 25 , the highest sensitivities are achieved by considering high-energy photons from distant sources , giving large values to the ratio formula _ 26 that enhance the sensitivity to formula _ 22 .
The best constraints on vacuum birefringence from formula _ 25 Lorentz violation come from polarimetry studies of gamma-ray bursts ( GRB ) .
For example , sensitivities of 10 to the formula _ 6 coefficients for Lorentz violation have been achieved .
For formula _ 4 , the velocity difference formula _ 22 is proportional to the wavelength , canceling the formula _ 24 dependence in the phase shift , implying there is no benefit to considering higher energies .
As a result , maximum sensitivity is achieved by studying the most distant source available , the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) .
Constraints on formula _ 4 coefficients for Lorentz violation from the CMB currently stand at around 10 GeV . Lorentz violation with formula _ 34 can lead to frequency-dependent light speeds .
To search for this effect , researchers compare the arrival times of photons from distant sources of pulsed radiation , such as GRB or pulsars .
Assuming photons of all energies are produced within a narrow window of time , dispersion would cause higher-energy photons to run ahead or behind lower-energy photons , leading to otherwise unexplained energy dependence in the arrival time .
For two photons of two different energies , the difference in arrival times is approximately given by the ratio formula _ 35 , where formula _ 22 is the difference in the group velocity and formula _ 37 is the distance traveled .
Sensitivity to Lorentz violation is then increased by considering very distant sources with rapidly changing time profiles .
The speed difference formula _ 22 grows as formula _ 39 , so higher-energy sources provide better sensitivity to effects from formula _ 40 Lorentz violation , making GRB an ideal source . Dispersion may or may not be accompanied by birefringence .
Polarization studies typically achieved sensitivities well beyond those achievable through dispersion .
As a result , most searches for dispersion focus on Lorentz violation that leads to dispersion but not birefringence .
The SME shows that dispersion without birefringence can only arise from operators of even dimension formula _ 1 .
Consequently , the energy dependence in the light speed from nonbirefringent Lorentz violation can be quadratic formula _ 42 or quartic formula _ 43 or any other even power of energy .
Odd powers of energy , such as linear formula _ 44 and cubic formula _ 45 , do not arise in effective field theory . While extreme sensitivity to Lorentz violation is achieved in astrophysical studies , most forms of Lorentz violation have little to no effect on light propagating in a vacuum .
These types of violations cannot be tested using astrophysical tests , but can be sought in laboratory-based experiments involving electromagnetic fields .
The primary examples are the modern Michelson-Morley experiments based on electromagnetic resonant cavities , which have achieved sensitivities on the order of parts in 10 to Lorentz violation . Resonant cavities support electromagnetic standing waves that oscillate at well-defined frequencies determined by the Maxwell equations and the geometry of the cavity .
The Lorentz-violating modifications to the Maxwell equations lead to tiny shifts in the resonant frequencies .
Experimenters search for these tiny shifts by comparing two or more cavities at different orientations .
Since rotation-symmetry violation is a form of Lorentz violation , the resonant frequencies may depend on the orientation of the cavity .
So , two cavities with different orientations may give different frequencies even if they are otherwise identical .
A typical experiment compares the frequencies of two identical cavities oriented at right angles in the laboratory .
To distinguish between frequency differences of more conventional origins , such as small defects in the cavities , and Lorentz violation , the cavities are typically placed on a turntable and rotated in the laboratory .
The orientation dependence from Lorentz violation would cause the frequency difference to change as the cavities rotate . Several classes of cavity experiment exist with different sensitivities to different types of Lorentz violation .
Microwave and optical cavities have been used to constrain formula _ 6 violations .
Microwave experiments have also placed some bounds on nonminimal formula _ 47 and formula _ 48 violations .
However , for formula _ 40 , the effects of Lorentz violation grow with frequency , so optical cavities provide better sensitivity to nonrenormalizable violations , all else being equal .
The geometrical symmetries of the cavity also affect the sensitivity since parity symmetric cavities are only directly sensitive to parity-even coefficients for Lorentz violation .
Ring resonators provide a complementary class of cavity experiment that can test parity-odd violations .
In a ring resonator , two modes propagating in opposites directions in the same ring are compared , rather than modes in two different cavities . A number of other searches for Lorentz violation in photons have been performed that do not fall under the above categories .
These include accelerator based experiments , atomic clocks , and threshold analyses . The results of experimental searches of Lorentz invariance violation in the photon sector of the SME are summarized in the Data Tables for Lorentz and CPT violation .
Impossible . comImpossible is an innovation group and incubator .
It started as a gift economy platform created by Lily Cole in 2013 , and since then has expanded to other areas , mainly design and technology .
Impossible is working on client projects with potentially far-reaching impacts . Impossible People ( previously Impossible . com ) is an altruism-based mobile app which invites people to give their services and skills away to help others .
Created by Lily Cole , the app allows users to post something they would like to do or need so that others can grant their wish , creating a culture of giving .
In May 2013 , Cole presented the app &amp; apos ; s beta in conjunction and with the support of Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales at a special event at Cambridge University .
It is the first Yunus social business in the UK .
The project became open source in March 2017 . In the past , the Impossible . com gift economy project received a grant of £ 200,000 from the Cabinet Office ’ s Innovation in Giving fund .
Other investors include Lily Cole herself and boyfriend and Impossible &amp; apos ; s co-founder , Kwame Ferreira .
Donations of services from Muhammad Yunus , Brian Boylan , chairman of Wolff Olins , Tea Uglow , creative director for Google ’ s Creative Lab , office space and &amp; quot ; angel investor &amp; quot ; role from Jimmy Wales , and legal services from Herbert Smith Freehills bolstered the social network . The project operated at a loss throughout 2014 and 2015 , as it disclosed posted losses of around £ 150,000 in 2014 and almost £ 250,000 in 2015 .
MapcodeThe mapcode system is a spatial reference system ( not to be confused with the Denso mapcode system ) .
A mapcode is a code consisting of two groups of letters and digits , separated by a dot .
It represents a location on the surface of the Earth , within the context of a separately specified country or territory .
For example , the entrance to the elevator of the Eiffel Tower in Paris is “ France 4J . Q2 ” .
As with addresses , it is often unnecessary to explicitly mention the country . The mapcode algorithm defines how a WGS 84 coordinate ( a latitude and longitude ) can be converted into a mapcode , and vice versa .
Mapcodes are supported on automotive navigation systems .
Many mapping companies have adopted mapcode . The mapcode system was designed specifically as a free , brand-less , international standard for representing any location on the surface of the Earth by a short , easy to recognize and remember “ code ” , usually consisting of between 4 and 7 letters and digits . The shortness is the key differentiating factor between mapcodes and other location references ; more densely populated areas are designated with shorter ( 4 character ) codes . The brevity of mapcodes was achieved through a combination of several ideas : The last idea , especially , yield very good results .
For example , although every location within the Netherlands can be identified by a 6-letter mapcode , half of the Dutch population can be found in about 40 cities and densely populated areas that together comprise less than 6,000 square kilometers .
By reserving 5-letter mapcodes for these areas , half of the population can thus be reached with 5 mapcode letters .
Since human dwellings and businesses are usually the more relevant locations in daily human life , this means that the relevant locations in the Netherlands have 5-letter mapcodes more often than 6-letter mapcodes .
In fact , a significant number of people lives in the 100 square kilometers of very densely populated city centers of Amsterdam , Rotterdam , The Hague , Eindhoven en Utrecht , which are covered by 4-letter codes .
The mapcode system thus defines a population-density-based code division for all ( roughly 200 ) countries on Earth , all ( roughly 100 ) overseas territories , and roughly 240 subdivisions ( provinces , states , oblasts etc . ) .
With the exception of Antarctica and the international waters , few localities on the surface of the Earth require a mapcode longer than 7 letters . Note that mapcodes can in fact be made arbitrarily precise : at the cost of two extra characters , a mapcode is guaranteed to be less than 25 centimeters from the original coordinate .
Every character added increases the accuracy further by a factor of 30 .
Hoewever , the mapcode documentation states that this defeats the key purpose of the mapcode system : to offer the simplest possible codes appropriate for public , every-day use . The mapcode system ( not to be confused with the Denso mapcode system , a different spatial reference system ) was developed in 2001 by TomTom &amp; apos ; s Pieter Geelen and Harold Goddijn , soon after the GPS satellite signals were opened up for civilian use .
It was decided to donate the mapcode system to the public domain in 2008 .
The algorithms and data tables are maintained by the Mapcode Foundation , which provides source code and specifications free of charge to any organization that wants to support mapcodes .
The mapcode system is the subject of a patent application and a standard filed at the International Organization for Standardization . The term &amp; quot ; mapcode &amp; quot ; was also used by Denso in Japan .
The international mapcode system operated by the Mapcode Foundation is in no way linked to Denso or based on the Denso system .
Oswald KohtsWilhelm Ernst Oswald Kohts ( 31 January 1844 in Berent , West Prussia – 1912 ) was a German physician and pediatrician . He studied medicine at the Universities of Jena , Königsberg and Berlin .
From 1870 he served as an assistant to Ernst Viktor von Leyden at Königsberg , and in 1872 began work as a secondary physician at the polyclinic in Strassburg .
Here , he became an associate professor and director of the children &amp; apos ; s clinic .
In 1878 he was appointed director of the university polyclinic .
Among his students and assistants at Strassburg were dermatologist Eduard Arning ( 1855-1936 ) and pediatrician Ferdinand Siegert ( 1865-1946 ) . In 1886 , he became a member of the &amp; quot ; Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina &amp; quot ; . Kohts was the author of several monographs that were included in Carl Gerhardt &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Handbuch der Kinderkrankheiten &amp; quot ; .
The following are some of his principal writings :
BreathometerBreathometer was a device that claimed to measure someone &amp; apos ; s blood alcohol content using their iOS and Android smartphones .
But the app proved unreliable , and was shut down by the Federal Trade Commission . Tim Smokoff is the current CEO .
Breathometer was founded in September 2012 by Charles Michael Yim , who is no longer the company ’ s CEO .
The company is headquartered in Burlingame , CA . Breathometer was founded by Charles Michael Yim in 2012 after he noted that there were no commercial breathalyzers for the smartphone market , and the only portable breathalyzers commercially available were both expensive and impractical for users to take with them on a night out . The company was partly funded through preorders collected via an Indiegogo crowd-sourcing campaign , which ran until April 2013 .
The campaign ’ s original goal was to raise $ 25,000 , but by the time it closed , it had raised $ 138,000 . In September 2013 , Yim appeared on Shark Tank , he originally asked for $ 250,000 for a 10 % stake in Breathometer , but all five “ sharks ” ended up investing a total of $ 1 million for a collective 30 % stake in the company .
It was the first time that all five sharks participated in a bid together . In January 2017 the FTC filed a lawsuit against Breathometer , alleging &amp; quot ; deceptive &amp; quot ; advertising .
While Breathometer claimed their devices were accurate , in truth , Breathometer &amp; apos ; s products were not adequately tested for accuracy , the FTC alleged .
Further , the FTC charged that the defendants were aware that Breeze regularly understated BAC levels .
Nonetheless , they allegedly failed to notify users of these problems and continued their deceptive advertising . According to the complaint , sales of Original and Breeze totaled $ 5 . 1 million .
The order required the company to pay full refunds to consumers who request them .
The Breathometer was a small device that plugged into the audio jack of a smartphone , coupled with a dedicated app that reads the user ’ s blood alcohol content ( BAC ) .
The app utilizes the smartphone to provide the processing power , which allows the device to be small enough to fit on a standard keychain .
If the user ’ s BAC level is over the legal limit , the app displays one-click calls to local taxi services , friends from contact lists living close by , or local hotels . Sample beta units were handed out at the 2013 SXSW in Austin , TX . The company has since expanded its mission .
Breathometer plans to release the Mint , an oral health tracker that tells the user if they have bad breath .
Sensors in the device track biomarkers associated with bad breath and have the potential to measure compounds that correlate to gum disease .
The company has a partnership with Philips in the area of oral hygiene .
Larry Ferguson ( screenwriter ) Larry Ferguson is an American screenwriter and film director .
As a screenwriter , his film credits include &amp; quot ; Highlander &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Beverly Hills Cop II &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; The Hunt for Red October &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Alien 3 &amp; quot ; .
Richard Webb ( settler ) Richard Webb ( May 5 , 1580 – July 1665 ) was a founding settler of Hartford and Norwalk , Connecticut .
He served as a deputy of the General Court of the Connecticut Colony from Norwalk in the session of May 1656 . He came to America from England in 1626 , and originally settled in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
He went to Hartford in 1636 , with the congregation of Thomas Hooker .
His home was on the west aide of Main Street , near the present corner of Church Street .
In Hartford he served as a grand-juror in 1643 , as a townsman in 1649 , and as a surveyor of highways in 1650 . He was one of the signers of the agreement for planting Norwalk , June 19 , 1650 .
He moved there soon after . He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founders of Hartford in the Ancient Burying Ground in Hartford , and he is also listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founders of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery . Webb &amp; apos ; s paternal grandmother was Margaret Arden , sister of Mary Arden , the mother of playwright William Shakespeare . Some researchers cite 1629 as the year that a Richard Webb ( b .
1580 ) and his son Richard ( b .
1610 ) arrived in Massachusetts .
In all likelihood , it was either the younger Richard that followed the Reverend Hooker in the 1636 settlement of Hartford , Conn .
or the Richard Webb in the company of an Elizabeth Webb who arrived in the 1630 Winthrop Fleet .
The elder Richard may have died in 1646 .

The Last Battle ( Harding ) The Last Battle : When U . S .
and German Soldiers Joined Forces in the Waning Hours of World War II in Europe is a book by the historian Stephen Harding which tells the story of the World War II Battle for Castle Itter . Published by Da Capo Press , on May 7 , 2013 , it describes a mixed force of United States Army , German Wehrmacht , and Austrian resistance fighters acting together to prevent the recapture of a number of French VIP prisoners being held at Itter Castle , Austria , by an SS assault party , ordered to retake the prison , days after Hitler ’ s suicide . The fourteen prisoners being held in the facility included two former French Prime Ministers , Paul Reynaud and Édouard Daladier , two former commanders of the French military , the son of famous prime minister Georges Clemenceau , and , Resistance member and sister of General Charles de Gaulle . The story is based on military records , author interviews , personal memoirs , and official German , American , and French histories . It was announced on 7 December 2015 that The Last Battle would be developed into a movie by StudioCanal .
The book was adapted by Bryce Zabel who will produce the movie with Andrew Rona and Alex Heineman from The Picture Company .
No release date has currently been set .

WardTroy G .
Ward is an American ice hockey coach .
Ward spent three years ( 1997 – 2000 ) as assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League . On June 30 , 2011 , following one year as an assistant coach , Ward was named as the new head coach of the Abbotsford Heat . He was named the head coach of the Vancouver Giants in the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) for the 2014 – 15 season but was released of his duties November 25 , 2014 , after 25 games . On June 10 , 2015 , the Madison Capitols announced that Ward had accepted the dual role of head coach and general manager for the team &amp; apos ; s upcoming 2015 – 16 season .
He resigned from both positions after one season .
Live from the StyleetronLive from the Styleetron is the debut studio album by Oakland-based hip hop group Raw Fusion .
The group was fronted by Ron Brooks , known as Money-B , an active member of Digital Underground who produced this album as a side project with fellow group member David Elliot known as DJ FUZE .
Among many featured artists was a young unknown performer named Tupac Shakur who would later become a legendary figure in the world of hip hop . The Raw Fusion album was vastly different from the Digital Underground style that relied upon samples from the 1970s P-Funk sound .
Critic Alex Henderson noted that Raw Fusion &amp; apos ; s first album had more in common with the jazzy sounds of groups like A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul .
Typical of Digital Underground members , the composition of lyrics employed a great deal of humor including making light of armed robbery and , in at least three tracks , the Jheri curl hairstyle popular in the 1980s . One of the few serious tracks on this album is &amp; quot ; Wild Francis , &amp; quot ; a political statement made through the tale of a woman who is killed by police after becoming a Marxist revolutionary figure . Featured artists included eight members of Digital Underground as well as guests Another Ninja , Cooley Ranks , Daddy Courtney , Jessica Jones , Mac-Mone , Margie Marie Rubio , Ronville , Sean , Styleetron , and Pam Taylor .
The album peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Heatseekers charts which highlights new and developing musical acts .
The single &amp; quot ; Throw Your Hands In The Air &amp; quot ; became a minor radio hit in the San Francisco metro area with a music video that was the first major production for notable Hollywood producers the Hughes Brothers . Gregory Jacobs , known by his stage name Humpty Hump among others , was the lead vocalist for Digital Underground who also appeared as a guest artist on &amp; quot ; Live from the Styleetron &amp; quot ; .
This particular stage persona of Jacobs was the fuel behind &amp; quot ; The Humpty Dance &amp; quot ; that peaked at number 11 on the Billboard charts in 1990 and first brought widespread fame to the group .
Money-B , new to Digital Underground , provided vocals in The Humpty Dance and three other tracks on the album &amp; quot ; Sex Packets &amp; quot ; and co-wrote &amp; quot ; Freaks of the Industry &amp; quot ; with Jacobs while DJ FUZE participated in two tracks .
Jacobs , in turn , appeared in &amp; quot ; Funkintoyoear &amp; quot ; on Raw Fusion &amp; apos ; s album appearing as both Shock G and Humpty Hump . Tupac Shakur , a roadie and backup dancer for Digital Underground , appeared as a guest artist on the album , the unknown rapper later becoming a hip hop legend .
Shakur &amp; apos ; s debut as an emcee had come only nine months prior to this Raw Fusion release , the 19-year-old appearing in the Digital Underground track &amp; quot ; Same Song &amp; quot ; with Dan Aykroyd released on the motion picture soundtrack Nothing but Trouble in February 1991 .
In October 1991 , one month prior to Raw Fusion &amp; apos ; s debut , Shakur again appeared with Digital Underground featured in a single track on the album &amp; quot ; Sons of the P &amp; quot ; . The track &amp; quot ; # 1 with a Bullet &amp; quot ; on &amp; quot ; Live from the Styleetron &amp; quot ; was only Shakur &amp; apos ; s third appearance as a rapper .
Raw Fusion frontman Money-B stated in an interview that Shakur , at that time , was not a great rapper but was always able to grab the attention of everyone in the room , noting his tremendous work ethic , passion , and drive .
Interestingly Shakur released his first solo album &amp; quot ; 2Pacalypse Now &amp; quot ; with Interscope Records on November 12 , 1991 , exactly the same Tuesday that &amp; quot ; Live from the Styleetron &amp; quot ; was released . Steve Counter served as sound engineer on both &amp; quot ; 2Pacalypse Now &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Live from the Styleetron &amp; quot ; as well as nine En Vogue albums during his career .
Another credited sound engineer Darrin Harris worked with many acts including Ghostface Killah , Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! , and the Bee Gees .
Perhaps the most notable sound engineer was Matt Kelly who has worked with the likes of Johnny Cash , Joe Satriani , and Little Jimmy Dickens throughout a career that began in 1958 . Within two years of Raw Fusion &amp; apos ; s debut , Shakur would be a well known recording artist and in less than five years he would be tragically murdered in Las Vegas .
Shakur and Money-B both appeared in an alleged sex tape filmed at a 1991 house party discovered by the media in early October 2011 .

Buler is assisted by nurse Mary McCall ( Molly Lamont ) , who is aghast when she recognizes the patient .
When Dawson heals , he is amazed by his new face ; his underling , Muggsie Brown ( Frank Mills , uncredited ) , remarks that he is now as handsome as a movie star . Dawson sends Muggsie to eliminate Buler and McCall , then phones in an anonymous tip about his henchman to get rid of everyone who knows about his new appearance .
Muggsie kills Buler and a nurse ( only it is not McCall ) and is in turn gunned down by the police .
Frightened when she reads about the murders in the newspaper , McCall flees across the country . Remembering Muggsie &amp; apos ; s comment , Dawson decides to become a movie star and moves to Hollywood , where he takes elocution lessons .
Under the alias &amp; quot ; Spencer Dutro &amp; quot ; , he gets hired to portray a gangster opposite top actress Sheila Barry ( Phyllis Brooks ) by director Bill Branch .
Barry is unimpressed by Dutro &amp; apos ; s acting ability and inflated ego . Meanwhile , Zenith Studio press agent Joe Haynes ( Wallace Ford ) is warned about his publicity stunts by Police Captain Spellman ( an uncredited Charles Wilson ) .

Publius Tullius VarroPublius Tullius Varro was a Roman general and senator during the reign of Hadrian .
The commander of two different legions during his career , one of his most important military roles was as commander of Legio VI Victrix during its transfer from Vetera in Germania Inferior to York in Roman Britain in AD 122 . Varro was a native of Tarquinii in Etruria .
Anthony Birley wrote that &amp; quot ; he had excellent connections in high places for his elder brother had been adopted , it would seem , by the influential Spaniard Dasumius , taking the names P .
Dasumius Rusticus &amp; quot ; , indicating his brother was &amp; quot ; consul ordinarius &amp; quot ; in 119 as the colleague of the emperor Hadrian .
However , it appears that Birley &amp; apos ; s understanding of this relationship was based on a misunderstanding of an inscription known as the Will of Dasumius , which had led experts to conclude that Tullius Varro was the friend of its testator whose son that person would adopt , and the adoptee would be known by the name L .
Dasumius Tullius Tuscus .
Once it was clear that the testator of this inscription was not &amp; quot ; Dasumius &amp; quot ; , this reconstruction lapses .
While it is possible that the man who adopted Varro &amp; apos ; s natural son was related to Dasumius Rusticus , he has no further relationship to Varro . Varro &amp; apos ; s career began in the &amp; quot ; vigintivirate &amp; quot ; as &amp; quot ; Xviri stlitibus judicandis &amp; quot ; , then held his first military posting , as military tribune of Legio XVI Flavia Firma .
He served as quaestor at Rome as &amp; quot ; quaestor urbanus &amp; quot ; , and after his praetorship , Varro was assigned his first legion to command , Legio XII Fulminata which was stationed in the border province of Cappadocia .
The sortition awarded him proconsular governor of Hispania Baetica which he held for a year , and Birley speculates that it may have been while he held this post that he came to the attention of Hadrian , who assigned him the &amp; quot ; delicate &amp; quot ; of uprooting Legio VI Victrix from its long-term home and relocating it to Britain . His command of a second legion was followed by a term as prefect of the &amp; quot ; aerarium Saturni &amp; quot ; , or public treasury , after which Varro was appointed suffect consul in 127 with Junius Paetus as his colleague .
After his consulship , Varro &amp; apos ; s subsequent offices were &amp; quot ; curator alvei Tiber &amp; quot ; , governor of Moesia Superior from 133 to 136 , and Proconsul of Africa from 142 to 143 .
Birley notes that Varro &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; social standing is demonstrated by his having been an augur . &amp; quot ; Due to a number of facts , it is generally accepted that the suffect consul of 152 , Lucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus , is Varro &amp; apos ; s biological son .
The elements &amp; quot ; Lucius Dasumius &amp; quot ; were added to the son &amp; apos ; s name from his adoptive father &amp; apos ; s whom Salomies notes was &amp; quot ; certainly related &amp; quot ; to Publius Dasumius Rusticus .
Galak-Z : The DimensionalGalak-Z : The Dimensional is a shooter video game by 17-Bit for Microsoft Windows , OS X , Linux and PlayStation 4 .
It was announced during Sony &amp; apos ; s pre-E3 2013 press conference in June 2013 .
17-Bit CEO Jake Kazdal describes it as &amp; quot ; modern &amp; quot ; Halo &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Far Cry 3 &amp; quot ; combat in a 2-dimensional shell . &amp; quot ; Reflecting its inspiration in part by Japanese anime , the game is also known officially by the Japanese title of &amp; quot ; Galak-Z &amp; quot ; is a two-dimensional sci-fi shooter video game with roguelike elements .
The game &amp; apos ; s levels are generated uniquely for each playthrough and are connected as an endless dungeon .
The levels include spawners for enemies and traps . Former Sega Japan developer Jake Kazdal started the game &amp; apos ; s development company , 17-Bit , in 2009 to make games similar to that of the 16-bit era .
They had previously released &amp; quot ; Skulls of the Shogun &amp; quot ; for Xbox 360 and Windows phones in early 2013 . &amp; quot ; Galak-Z &amp; quot ; gameplay was inspired by what senior producer Raj Joshi called new wave &amp; apos ; roguelikes &amp; quot ; , especially &amp; quot ; Spelunky &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Don &amp; apos ; t Starve &amp; quot ; .
The 17-Bit team sought to emulate &amp; quot ; Don &amp; apos ; t Starve &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; survival mechanics &amp; quot ; , which encouraged players to plan ahead during their games .
The team also liked the game &amp; apos ; s progression tech trees , which provides the player more options as the game advances .
&amp; quot ; Spelunky &amp; quot ; handheld release and its &amp; quot ; pick-up-and-play &amp; quot ; variable game length inspired 17-Bit to release &amp; quot ; Galak-Z &amp; quot ; on the PlayStation Vita .
&amp; quot ; Galak-Z &amp; quot ; art style draws from anime influences , including Ichiro Itano &amp; apos ; s signature &amp; quot ; Macross &amp; quot ; series &amp; quot ; Itano Circus &amp; quot ; missile fusillade . &amp; quot ; Galak-Z &amp; quot ; was announced during Sony &amp; apos ; s pre-E3 2013 press conference in June 2013 .
A playable version of &amp; quot ; Galak-Z &amp; quot ; was on display at video game merchandiser Fangamer and video game collective Attract Mode &amp; apos ; s August 2013 PAX Prime combined event in Seattle .
The game was planned for release on PlayStation 4 in Q2 / Q3 2014 , followed by Microsoft Windows and PlayStation Vita versions , successively - this was before the team decided to allow themselves more time for development , pushing the release window into 2015 .
All versions would contain the same content . On July 14 , 2015 , 17-Bit announced that the PlayStation 4 version would be released on August 4 , 2015 , with the PC version following a couple months later .
The PlayStation Vita version was cancelled . In April 2016 , 17-Bit joined forces with IndieBox , a monthly subscription box service , to create an exclusive , custom-designed , physical release of &amp; quot ; Galak-Z &amp; quot ; .
This limited , individually-numbered collector ’ s box included a themed USB drive with DRM-free copy of the game , the official soundtrack on cassette tape , an instruction manual and Steam key , along with several other collectible items . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the game has received an average score of 83 , based on 26 reviews indicating &amp; quot ; Generally favorable reviews &amp; quot ; .
IGN awarded it 8 . 3 out of ten , saying &amp; quot ; While not a full-fledged roguelike , &amp; quot ; Galak-Z &amp; quot ; s superb controls and charming personality make it great . &amp; quot ; PC Gamer awarded it a score of 88 % , saying &amp; quot ; Challenging but immaculately calibrated controls power an exciting and enormously rewarding sci-fi roguelike . &amp; quot ;

The type and only known specimen is an articulated , but very incomplete individual consisting of a large , incomplete , plate-covered head , and some of the vertebral column , with a total length of 10 centimeters .

Sunita Chowdary of &amp; quot ; The Hindu &amp; quot ; wrote &amp; quot ; The narration is good , keeps the curiosity factor alive but it is not the sort that keeps us on the edge of our seats and taking us to nail-biting climaxes .
The story offers little thrill .
There is sufficient humor and romance to keep the film balanced but the story with the twist is not so much about the crime but about the mindset of the criminal who uses a clever mix of science and religion to plan a brilliant murder &amp; quot ; .
Hemanth Kumar of &amp; quot ; The Times of India &amp; quot ; wrote &amp; quot ; The good thing about the film is that it sticks to its storyline and everyone seems to know what they are doing .
Karthikeya is one of the finer films made in the recent past and in times like these , that in itself is like a big compliment &amp; quot ; and rated the film 3 . 5 out of 5 .
Suresh Kavirayani of &amp; quot ; Deccan Chronicle &amp; quot ; wrote &amp; quot ; Despite its drawbacks ‘ Karthikeya ’ is a very refreshing film and Chandu Mondeti ’ s debut can be termed a success .
It is a thriller with tight screenplay a new story .
Whoever feels bored with the regular song-dance masala films , should watch this thriller for a change &amp; quot ; and rated the film 3 out of 5 .
&amp; quot ; Sify &amp; quot ; wrote &amp; quot ; Overall Karthikeya is different from regular commercial movies that dot the Telugu screen .
Like we said it is a suspense thriller that mixes bhakti and rational thinking quite well to large extent and we do appreciate the producer and the actor Nikhil for attempting something novel &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; 123telugu &amp; quot ; stated &amp; quot ; On the whole , Karthikeya is one of the most refreshing films in the recent past .
Novel concept , gripping screenplay , Nikhil ’ s performance and cleverly designed suspense elements make this film different from others , and ends up as quite an engaging watch this weekend &amp; quot ; and rated it 3 . 5 out of 5 .
Jeevi of &amp; quot ; Idlebrain . com &amp; quot ; wrote &amp; quot ; Actor Nikhil and producer should be appreciated for agreeing to do a film that is different from regular Telugu movies .
Supported by a neat screenplay and a bit of comedy , debutant director Chandoo Mondeti delivers a decent movie .
Additional plus point of the movie is runtime .
The minus points of the movie are slow-paced narration .
The family drama and romance didn ’ t work well .

Sextus Julius MajorSextus Julius Major was a Roman senator active during the first half of the second century , and who held several positions in the service of the emperor .
Major was suffect consul around 126 .
Major &amp; apos ; s origins were with the &amp; quot ; high aristocracy &amp; quot ; of Asia Minor .
Ronald Syme notes his ancestors included Polemon I the king of Pontus and Antonia Pythodoris .
No &amp; quot ; cursus honorum &amp; quot ; for Julius Major has yet been recovered , but evidence for a number of offices he held have been recovered .
The earliest office he held was legatus or commander of Legio III Augusta stationed at Lambaesis in Numidia ( which Syme notes &amp; quot ; normally carried designation to a consulship &amp; quot ; ) in 125 and 126 .
Following his consulship , Major was appointed governor of the imperial province of Moesia Inferior between 131 and 135 , then governor of the important imperial province of Syria from 137 to 139 . Julius Major concluded his career by holding a proconsulate in 141 / 142 , but opinion is divided whether he was proconsul of Africa or Asia : Syme notes the evidence supports either province , although he believes it is likely Julius was proconsul of Asia , an opinion Géza Alföldy concurs with .
He was married to Julia Antonia Eurydice , a wealthy aristocratic woman known from seven inscriptions at Nysa on the Maeander relating to a series of statues of the imperial family of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus , which were erected per the directions in her will .
These statues have been dated between the years 148 and 150 , and because they omit his name suggest Julius Major was dead by then .
These inscriptions also provide information about their three children :

Crime in North KoreaCrime is present in various forms in North Korea , officially known as the Democratic People &amp; apos ; s Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) . Many people in North Korea are stricken with poverty and as a result , are often forced to take up extreme measures in order to survive .
Several defectors have reported hearing rumours that murder and cannibalism is rife in the country ; these rumours first arose during the Great Famine of 1994 to 1998 . The Korea Institute for National Unification &amp; apos ; s 2014 &amp; quot ; White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea &amp; quot ; lists twelve public executions between 2004 and 2010 for the crime of murder .
Murder victims included lovers , a spouse , a creditor , and a hospital administrator . In North Korea , any perceived criticism of the country &amp; apos ; s political leaders is seen as a grave offense .
Treason is also taken very seriously ; traitorous behaviour may include attempting to escape to South Korea , or simply praising any aspect of South Korean culture .
Crossing the northern border into China or Russia is also illegal , but this law is less strictly enforced , due to the sheer number of North Koreans driven across the border in search of employment . Criticism or rejection of socialist principles , or idleness in upholding these principles , is another serious political crime .
This category of offence includes anything which threatens the socialist system – for example , running a private business , or stealing agricultural goods such as corn , rice or potatoes . A small number of American citizens have been charged in North Korea for alleged crimes against the nation .
This encompasses illegally trespassing into the country or displaying signs of hostility towards the country .
Two reporters from the United States were sentenced to penal labour after being found guilty of crimes against the nation .
They were freed later the same year , when Bill Clinton visited the then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il to negotiate their release .
In April 2013 , American tour operator Kenneth Bae , also known as Pae Jun Ho , was accused of plotting to overthrow the North Korean government .
State media reported that there was evidence to substantiate the claim .
He has since been released and allowed to return to the United States .
According to the law of North Korea , such an act is punishable either by a life sentence in prison , or death . Prostitution in North Korea is illegal and , according to the North Korean government , does not exist .
However , the government is reported to employ approximately 2,000 women , known as the &amp; quot ; Kippumjo &amp; quot ; , to provide sexual services to high-ranking officials .
There is also widespread human trafficking within the country ; women and girls are often sold abroad , mostly to China , where they are subjected to forced prostitution or forced marriage .
Others may willingly migrate to China , only to be kidnapped by traffickers on arrival . Corruption in North Korea is a widespread and growing problem in the country .
It is ranked 174 out of 176 countries in Transparency International &amp; apos ; s 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index , tied with Somalia and Afghanistan , making the country one of the &amp; quot ; &amp; apos ; most corrupt &amp; apos ; nations on Earth &amp; quot ; .
Strict rules and draconian punishments imposed by the regime against , for example , accessing foreign media , are commonly evaded by bribing the police .
Informing on colleagues and family members has become less common .

Ottoman ArabiaThe Ottoman era in the history of Arabia lasted from 1517 to 1918 .
Ottoman degree of control over these lands varied over the four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the Empire &amp; apos ; s central authority . In the 16th century , the Ottomans added the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast ( the Hejaz , Asir and Al-Hasa ) to the Empire and claimed suzerainty over the interior .
The main reason was to thwart Portuguese attempts to attack the Red Sea ( hence the Hejaz ) and the Indian Ocean .
As early as 1578 , the Sharifs of Mecca launched forays into the desert to punish the Najdi tribes who mounted raids on oases and tribes in the Hejaz . The emergence of what was to become the Saudi royal family , known as the Al Saud , began in Nejd in central Arabia in 1744 , when Muhammad bin Saud , founder of the dynasty , joined forces with the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab who was from the Hanbali school of thought , This alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today . The first Saudi state was established in 1744 in the area around Riyadh , rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia .
When Ibn Abd al-Wahab abandoned the position of imam in 1773 , the spread of Saudi control over the whole southern and central Najd was completed .
In the late 1780s , the northern Najd was added to the Saudi emirate .
In 1792 , Al-Hasa fell to the Saudis .
The Saudi emirate gained control of Taif in 1802 , and of Medina in 1804 . The first Saudi state was destroyed by 1818 by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt , Mohammed Ali Pasha .
A much smaller second &amp; quot ; Saudi state &amp; quot ; , located mainly in Nejd , was established in 1824 .
Throughout the rest of the 19th century , the Al Saud contested control of the interior of what was to become Saudi Arabia with another Arabian ruling family , the Al Rashid .
By 1891 , the Al Rashid were victorious and the Al Saud were driven into exile in Kuwait . At the beginning of the 20th century , the Ottoman Empire continued to control or have a suzerainty ( albeit nominal ) over most of the peninsula .
Subject to this suzerainty , Arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers , with the Sharif of Mecca having pre-eminence and ruling the Hejaz . In 1902 , Ibn Saud took control of Riyadh in Nejd and brought the Al Saud back to Nejd .
Ibn Saud gained the support of the Ikhwan , a tribal army inspired by Wahhabism and led by Sultan ibn Bijad and Faisal Al-Dawish , and which had grown quickly after its foundation in 1912 .
With the aid of the Ikhwan , Ibn Saud captured Hasa from the Ottomans in 1913 . In 1916 , with the encouragement and support of Britain ( which was fighting the Ottomans in World War I ) , the Sharif of Mecca , Hussein bin Ali , led a pan-Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire to create a united Arab state .
Although the Arab Revolt of 1916 to 1918 failed in its objective , the Allied victory in World War I resulted in the end of Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia . When the Ottomans conquered Mamluk territory in 1517 , the role of the Ottoman sultan in the Hijaz was first and foremost to take care of the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina , and provide safe passage for the many Muslims from various regions who travelled to Mecca in order to perform the Hajj .
The Sultan was sometimes referred to as &amp; quot ; Servant of the Holy Places &amp; quot ; but since the Ottoman rulers could not claim lineage from the Prophet Muhammad , it was important to maintain an image of power and piety through construction projects , financial support and caretaking . There is no record of a ruling Sultan visiting Mecca during the Hajj but according to primary records , Ottoman princes and princesses were sent to make the pilgrimage or visit the Holy Cities during the year .
The distance from the center of the empire in Istanbul , as well as the length and danger of the journey , was likely the main factor that prevented Sultans from travelling to the Hijaz . Regional administration of Mecca and Medina was left in the hands of the Sharifs , or the stewards of Mecca since the Abbasid caliphate .
The Sharifs maintained a level of local autonomy under the rule of the Sultan ; however in order to balance the local influences , the Sultan appointed the kadis and lesser officials in the region .
At first , being appointed the kadi in the region was considered a low position , but as religion grew more important within the culture of the Ottoman Empire , the role of the kadis in the Mecca and Medina grew in prominence . Aside from customs collected in Jeddah , the inhabitants of the Hijaz did not pay taxes to the empire and the finances of the city were taken care of through various waqf properties across the rest of the empire , dedicated to support the people of Mecca and Medina as an act of charity with religious significance because of the holy status of the two cities . The central Ottoman government controlled caravan routes to Mecca , and was obligated to protect pilgrims along these routes .
This included providing supplies such as food and water for the journey .
Additionally , this included providing subsidies to the desert Bedouin tribes whose limited resources were used by pilgrims along the major routes from Damascus and Cairo respectively .
The Ottoman Empire , as custodian of Mecca and Medina , was supposed to provide safe passage for all pilgrims travelling to the Holy Cities .
However , political alliances and conflicts shaped the routes that were opened or closed . Particularly in the case of the Safavid Empire , the Ottomans closed the shortest route from Basra ( in present-day Iraq ) that would have allowed Shi ’ i pilgrims to cross the Persian Gulf into the Arabian Peninsula .
Pilgrims were instead required to use the official caravan routes from Damascus , Cairo or Yemen .
From the Mughal Empire , sea routes were blocked by the presence of Portuguese ships in the Indian Ocean ; from Central Asia , wars between the Uzbeks and Safavids also led to complications in caravan routes .
Most Central Asian pilgrims went through Istanbul or Delhi to join a pilgrimage caravan .
Trade routes often flourished along pilgrimage routes , since the existing infrastructure and protections were established , and travelling pilgrims increased the demand for products . Construction , repairs and addition to religious sites in Mecca and Medina were costly , due to the location of the cities and need for imported materials , but it was a symbol of the power and generosity of the Sultan .
Repairs that had to be made to the Kabah after a flood in 1630 were contentious because of the religious significance of the building itself .
These repairs were generally aimed at preserving the structural integrity of the site , yet the opinion of local religious scholars on the extent of the repairs meant that the project became politicized because Ridhwan Agha , who was in charge of overseeing the repairs , was a representative of the Sultan as opposed to an elite from the Hijaz . Other projects included building , repairing and maintaining water pipes that served pilgrims , and establishing soup kitchens , schools and charitable foundations within the region . During the era of Ottoman rule , the territory of modern Saudi Arabia was divided between the following entities :

Mexican immigration to Costa RicaMexican immigration to Costa Rica comprises people who emigrated from Mexico to Costa Rica and their descendants .
Costa Rica has the most Mexicans living in Central America , aside from Guatemala .
The waves of migration from Mexico to Costa Rica started from 1970s , as they were attracted by a stable democracy , a mild climate and political stability that characterizes this country south of Central .
The Mexican population in Costa Rica reaches more than 5,000 people who exercise as professionals , doctors , secretaries , among other services .
Costa Rica is the seventh destination for Mexican immigrants in the world , and first in Hispanic America .
Unlike other destinations , most Mexicans who immigrate to Costa Rica are mainly from Nuevo León , Tamaulipas , Chihuahua , Baja California and Mexico City .
Despite having more cultural elements similar to the northern countries of Central America ( Guatemala , El Salvador and Honduras ) , Mexicans in Costa Rica are quickly assimilated by the Costa Rican population .
From 2010 , a new wave of Mexican immigrants began coming to Costa Rica , and these are mainly young professionals , who find no opportunities in their country , migrate to the Central American country .
Many others are running away from the waves of violence following the war against drug trafficking in Mexico . One of the growing destinations for the Mexican population in the 21st century is Costa Rica , becoming the Central American nation with the largest population of Mexican citizens , exceeding immigration into Panama and Guatemala .
Mexicans who migrate to Costa Rica are generally young families looking for development opportunities and job growth .
Mexicans in Costa Rica numbered 2,327 in 2005 .

&amp; amp ; quot ; Wimbledon &amp; amp ; quot ; caseCase of the S . S .
&amp; quot ; Wimbledon &amp; quot ; , Britain &amp; quot ; et al &amp; quot ; .
v .
Germany , ( 1923 ) PCIJ Series A01 is a judgment of the Permanent Court of International Justice , rendered on August 17th , 1923 .
The case primarily dealt with issues pertaining to attributes of sovereignty , treaty obligations &amp; quot ; qua &amp; quot ; internal law , and the jurisprudence related to international canals . An English steamship , the &amp; quot ; Wimbledon &amp; quot ; , was time-chartered by a French Company , &amp; quot ; Les Affréteurs réunis &amp; quot ; , which was based in Paris .
According to the terms of the charter , the vessel had taken on board at Salonica 4,200 tons of munitions and artillery stores consigned to the Polish Naval Base at Danzig .
On March 21 , 1921 , &amp; quot ; Wimbledon &amp; quot ; arrived at the Kiel Canal , but the Director of Canal Traffic refused permission to pass through by basing his refusal upon the neutrality orders issued by Germany in connection with the Russo-Polish war .
The French Ambassador at Berlin requested the German government to withdraw the prohibition and to allow &amp; quot ; Wimbledon &amp; quot ; to pass through the Kiel Canal , in conformity with Article 380 of the Treaty of Versailles .
The German government replied that it would not allow a vessel with a cargo of munitions and artillery stores consigned to the Polish Military Mission at Danzig , to pass through the canal , as the German Neutrality Orders prohibited the transit of cargoes of this kind destined for Poland or Russia , and Article 380 of the Treaty of Versailles was not an obstacle to the application of sucb orders to the Kiel Canal .
The &amp; quot ; Société des Affréteurs réunis &amp; quot ; telegraphed to the captain of the S . S .
&amp; quot ; Wimbledon &amp; quot ; , ordering him to continue his voyage by the Danish Straits .
The vessel weighed anchor on April 1 and , proceeding by Skagen , reached Danzig , its port of destination on April 6 ; it had been detained for eleven days , and had taken two extra days for its deviation . The British , French , Italian and Japanese governments brought the action that was heard from January 16 , 1923 to August 17 , 1923 . The Court had these members : The court considered Articles 380 to 386 of the Treaty of Versailles and Articles 2 and 7 of the Hague Convention of 1907 . The court first had to consider Poland ’ s application to intervene , which it allowed . It then considered the substantive issue in the case and found that Germany was perfectly free to regulate its neutrality in the war .
However , it found that the canal had ceased to be an internal navigable waterway of Germany .
Germany thus had a definite duty of allowing the passage of the “ Wimbledon ” through the Kiel Canal , and its neutrality did not oblige the prohibition of allowing the passage . Judges Anzilotti , Huber and Schüking , dissented .

Fuck : Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment LibertiesFuck : Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties is a nonfiction book by law professor Christopher M .
Fairman about freedom of speech , the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , censorship , and use of the word &amp; quot ; fuck &amp; quot ; in society .
The book was first published in 2009 by Sphinx as a follow-up on the author &amp; apos ; s article &amp; quot ; Fuck &amp; quot ; , published in 2007 in the &amp; quot ; Cardozo Law Review &amp; quot ; .
It cites studies from academics in social science , psychoanalysis , and linguistics .
Fairman establishes that most current usages of the word have connotations distinct from its meaning of sexual intercourse .
The book discusses the efforts of conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance .
The author says that legal precedent regarding its use is unclear because of contradictory court decisions .
Fairman argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict the use of specific words , this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought . The book received a mostly favorable reception from news sources and library trade publications .
&amp; quot ; Library Journal &amp; quot ; described the book as a sincere analysis of the word and its history of censorship , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; called it stimulating , and the &amp; quot ; San Diego Law Review &amp; quot ; said it was thought-provoking .
One reviewer said that the book , like the article , was a format for the author to repeatedly use &amp; quot ; fuck &amp; quot ; , rather than actually analyze it from a rigorous perspective .
After the book &amp; apos ; s release , Fairman was consulted by media sources including CNN and &amp; quot ; The New York Times &amp; quot ; , as well as the American Civil Liberties Union , on issues surrounding word taboo in society . Christopher M .
Fairman graduated from the University of Texas at Austin .
He taught high-school level history for nine years before returning to his alma mater where he ultimately received his Juris Doctor degree .
He worked as a clerk on the Texas Court of Appeals for the Third District for Justice J .
Woodfin Jones .
Subsequently , he was a clerk on the U . S .
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for Judge Fortunato P .
Benavides , and worked for the law firm Weil Gotshal in their office in Dallas .
Fairman became a professor at Ohio State University &amp; apos ; s Moritz College of Law in 2000 .
He specialized in areas of freedom of speech and word taboo , and earned a reputation as an expert on the subject of legal ethics . Fairman was motivated to conduct research on &amp; quot ; fuck &amp; quot ; after learning of a Columbus , Ohio , man who was arrested for using the word in an email to a judge in 2004 .
Fairman delayed writing the article until he received tenure because he was concerned its publication would adversely affect his professional reputation .
Nevertheless , his supervisors did not try to convince him to cease research into the topic .
Government funding helped finance Fairman &amp; apos ; s scholarship . His original 2006 article &amp; quot ; Fuck &amp; quot ; is an analysis of forbidden speech from linguistic and legal perspectives .
It covers use of the word in case studies about sexual harassment and education .
The article is 74 pages long , and the word &amp; quot ; fuck &amp; quot ; appears over 560 times .
According to author Jesse Sheidlower in his book &amp; quot ; The F-Word &amp; quot ; , Fairman &amp; apos ; s work is the first academic article with the title of simply &amp; quot ; Fuck &amp; quot ; . Fairman made his article available as a working paper on the Social Science Research Network website on April 17 , 2006 .
Initially the author unsuccessfully tried to have the article published by providing copies to multiple U . S .
law reviews .
The &amp; quot ; Kansas Law Review &amp; quot ; rejected his article 25 minutes after receipt .
It was published by the &amp; quot ; Cardozo Law Review &amp; quot ; in 2007 .
The author wrote a follow-up piece in April 2007 titled &amp; quot ; Fuck and Law Faculty Rankings &amp; quot ; .
Fairman died on July 22 , 2015 .
At the time of his death , Fairman &amp; apos ; s 2007 &amp; quot ; Cardozo Law Review &amp; quot ; article , &amp; quot ; Fuck &amp; quot ; was still classed with the 20 top downloaded works on the Social Science Research Network . &amp; quot ; Fuck &amp; quot ; cites studies from academics in social science , psychoanalysis , and linguistics .
Of the sixteen chapters in the book , eight use the word &amp; quot ; fuck &amp; quot ; in their titles .
He discusses uses of the word from the 15th century onwards .
Fairman establishes that most current usages have connotations distinct from its denotation of sexual intercourse , and asserts that rather than having sexual meaning , the word &amp; apos ; s use is most commonly associated with power . Fairman discusses the efforts of conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance in the country , and says these acts are opposed to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution .
Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship .
He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process .
He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word . Fairman writes that legal precedent regarding use of the word is unclear because of contradictory court decisions .
He presents case studies of these contradictory applications of the law , and uses them to analyze public perceptions surrounding freedom of speech .
He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment , such as speech intended to cause violent acts , and discusses the manner in which federal and state governments sanction these exceptions .
Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians &amp; apos ; usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely .
He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words that can be used in speech , this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought . &amp; quot ; Fuck : Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties &amp; quot ; was first published in 2009 in paperback by Sphinx Publishing , and in an electronic format for the Amazon Kindle the same year .
The &amp; quot ; Seattle Post-Intelligencer &amp; quot ; called Fairman &amp; apos ; s paper compelling and amusing .
&amp; quot ; The Horn Book Magazine &amp; quot ; described the paper as a contemplative scholarly work which was simultaneously an engaging read .
Writing in the &amp; quot ; San Diego Law Review &amp; quot ; , Orly Lobel called Fairman &amp; apos ; s article a thought-provoking analysis into how the law and the First Amendment address issues of sexual language .
In a 2011 article for the &amp; quot ; Federal Communications Law Journal &amp; quot ; , W . Wat Hopkins was critical of Fairman &amp; apos ; s article and subsequent book , writing that both appeared to be formats for the author to repeatedly use the word &amp; quot ; fuck &amp; quot ; , rather than actually analyze the subject from a rigorous perspective . A review of the book in &amp; quot ; Publishers Weekly &amp; quot ; called it a vibrant extension of his article , and described it as educational and assertive in its promotion of freedom of speech , particularly in the face of the controversial language discussed .
&amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; reviewed &amp; quot ; Fuck &amp; quot ; and called it a stimulating book .
The review concluded , &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; h &amp; # 93 ; ighly recommended .
All readership levels . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Library Journal &amp; quot ; described the book as a sincere analysis of &amp; quot ; fuck &amp; quot ; and its history of censorship .
The review characterized the book as of a higher quality than &amp; quot ; The Compleat Motherfucker : A History of the Mother of all Dirty Words &amp; quot ; ( 2009 ) by Jim Dawson .
Ian Crouch of &amp; quot ; The New Yorker &amp; quot ; praised the cover design for the book .
Crouch observed that the word &amp; quot ; Fuck &amp; quot ; was shown partially obscured by correction fluid but was still clearly evident in full .
He concluded this was an appropriate image for a book on free speech and word taboo . After the book &amp; apos ; s publication , Fairman was consulted by media sources , including CNN , on issues involving word taboo .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio invited Fairman to host its forum &amp; quot ; Word Taboos &amp; quot ; in 2010 ; his presentation was titled &amp; quot ; Putting the &amp; apos ; F &amp; apos ; in Free Speech &amp; quot ; .
In a 2012 article on the word &amp; quot ; fuck &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; The New York Times &amp; quot ; characterized Fairman as the foremost legal scholar in the United States on the word &amp; quot ; fuck &amp; quot ; .

Sarawak EnergyThe Sarawak Energy Berhad ( SEB ) is the company responsible for the generation , transmission and distribution of electricity for the state of Sarawak in Malaysia .
It is wholly owned by the State Government of Sarawak . , Sarawak Energy had about 600,000 customers in the state . Sarawak Energy &amp; apos ; s history began in 1932 , with the formation of &amp; quot ; Sarawak Electricity Supply Company &amp; quot ; , by the Brooke Administration , to operate public electricity supply within Sarawak .
Prior to that , in 1921 an Electrical Section within the Public Works Department was set up to look after the public electricity supply . In 1962 , under the Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation Ordinance 1962 , the Sarawak Electricity Company was dissolved , and later created into a Corporation , known as Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation ( SESCO ) ( Malay : Perbadanan Pembekalan Letrik Sarawak , and later Perbadanan Pembekalan Elektrik Sarawak or PPLS ) .
In 1996 , Sarawak Enterprise Corporation Berhad bought over 45 % stake of the Corporation from the Sarawak Government . In 2005 , SESCO was privatised and known as Syarikat SESCO Berhad , and bought over by Sarawak Energy Berhad .
In January 2016 , Sarawak began to export electricity from Sarawak to West Kalimantan , Indonesia through a 275kV interconnection operated by Sarawak Energy .
This project is the first successful power trading project for Malaysia . SubsidiariesIt has 36 power stations , a total installed capacity of 1315MW , comprising 5 per cent diesel engine , 25 . 6 per cent gas turbines , 36 . 5 per cent coal-fired power plant , 25 per cent Combined Cycle power station and 7 . 6 per cent hydro turbines throughout the state .
The major towns are connected to via a 275 / 132kV State Transmission Grid . SESCO generates electricity mainly from two major types of plant ; hydroelectric plants and thermal plants . Hydroelectric power plantsThermal power plantsThere are 35 thermal power plants and diesel-electric plants with installed generating capacity of 1215 MW in operation .
Selected major plants are : A notable aspect of SESCO operation is the many small diesel-electric power plants in isolated areas , some supplied by air at prohibitive cost .
Water scarcity in IndiaWater scarcity involves water &amp; quot ; stress , water shortage &amp; quot ; or &amp; quot ; deficits &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; water crisis &amp; quot ; .
This may be due to both natural and human factors .
Main factors that contribute to this issue include poor management of resources , lack of government regulation , and man made waste .
18 percent of the world &amp; apos ; s population which resides in India only has access to 4 percent of usable water sources .
Official data in the past decade depicts how annual per capita availability of water in the country has plummeted significantly with 163 million Indians lacking access to safe drinking water .
The water sources are contaminated with both bio and chemical pollutants .
21 % of the country &amp; apos ; s diseases are water-related with only 33 % of the country having access to traditional sanitation .
Excessive use of groundwater for agriculture has also caused a strain in the resource .
As India is one of the top agriculture producers in the world , the consumption of water for land and crops is also one the highest .
The results of the widespread use of traditional techniques used for irrigation aligned with mismanagement are few of the reasons for the water deficit .
A significant portion of water used for industrial and domestic purposes is waste when returned to the streams .
The demand for freshwater is increasing with the growing population , but the decreasing amount of supply fails to meet the needs of the people . The increased amount of solid wastes in water systems such as lakes and rivers also heavily pollute the water .
To combat this problem , the government issued the Ganga Action Plan issued in 1984 to clean up the Ganges River .
However , much of the river remains polluted with a high coli form count at many places .
This is largely due to lack of maintenance of the facilities as well inadequate fees for service .
Due to this issue , urgent need for safe drinking water is 70 . 1 % of the households in urban areas .
18 . 7 % in rural received organized pipe water supply and others have to depend on surface and ground water which is untreated . Along with the strain on surface water , the country is also facing great stress with freshwater .
Lack of strict state regulation on ground water development has caused a strain on the amount of freshwater available .
Indifference from bureaucratic powers and constant neglect has caused the problem to intensify .
In hand with the lack of government interference and continued industrial waste deposited into major rivers , most freshwater entering the bodies of water is defiled .
The approximation of the untreated water entering the water sources such as rivers and lakes is 90 percent and only furthers the problem .
In 2016 , the city of Latur experienced a great water shortage .
Much of the farming industry came to a halt and created both food insecurity and massive unemployment .
Much of the local economy and farming regions nearly collapsed with the citizens having no choice but to use the polluted water .
The acute water shortage prevailing in the forest areas of Tamil Nadu &amp; apos ; s districts of Madurai and Dindigul has led to the deaths of Indian gaurs found in the forest of the region , as they come in search of water are killed falling into the wells . With support from government and UNICEF , villagers in Palve Budruk , located in the drought-prone Parner Block in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra , developed a catchment plan covering 1,435 hectors – over 80 % of the land available .
The system has three check dams , 20 canal bunds , two small percolation tanks linked to the main tank and 19 village ponds .
Water stored in the percolation tank , is strictly meant for domestic use only .
Piped water is supplied for an hour a day in the morning , during which time families fill up water for drinking and cooking . SIS Seoul International School is Fundraising to bring water to India , and can be found in South Korea , or siskorea . They have also started building a strong community for the water crisis in indiaThe Canadian start-up Decode Global has developed the mobile game Get Water ! , a game for social change focusing on the water scarcity in India and the effect it has on girls &amp; apos ; education .
The game &amp; apos ; s primary goal is to raise awareness of the water crisis , by educating children as well as adult gamers .
To put more focus on children &amp; apos ; d learning , the company has published a 6-part lesson plan for 4-6 grade teachers , available for download as a pdf from the game &amp; apos ; s website . The Central Ground Water Authority ( CGWA ) has notified 82 areas ( Districts , Blocks , Mandals , Talukas , Municipalities ) for regulation of ground water development .
In these areas , installation of new ground water abstraction structures is not permitted without prior specific approval of the Authority / Authorized officer .
Moreover , proposals for setting up / expansion of ground water based industries including bottled water manufacturing units are forwarded by State Pollution Control Boards and Bureau of Indian Standards to CGWA for seeking No Objection Certificate ( NOC ) for ground water withdrawal .
NOC is not accorded to such industries including bottled water manufacturing units peas notified by the Authority .
In non-notified areas , NOC is issued with mandatory pre-conditions of adoption of rain water harvesting system , monitoring of ground water abstraction as well as monitoring of ground water level and quality etc .
by the industry .
For enforcement of the regulatory directions issued under Section 5 of Environment ( Protection ) Act , 1986 , concerned Deputy Commissioners / District Collectors have been authorized to take necessary action in case of violations of directives of CGWA in the notified areas . According to Indian government report , warns that 21 cities will run out a groundwater by years of 2020 .
Ferdinand SiegertFerdinand Siegert ( 22 April 1865 , Neuwied am Rhein – 21 February 1946 , Köln ) was a German pediatrician .
His name is associated with &amp; quot ; Siegert &amp; apos ; s sign &amp; quot ; , defined as shortness and inward curvature of the terminal phalanges of the little fingers in Down &amp; apos ; s syndrome . In 1889 he received his medical doctorate form the University of Strassburg , subsequently serving as a secondary physician in Mödling near Vienna .
Afterwards , he worked as an assistant under Friedrich Wilhelm Zahn at the institute of pathology in Geneva , and as an assistant to Oswald Kohts at the university children &amp; apos ; s clinic in Strassburg .
While at Strassburg , he founded a &amp; quot ; Säuglingsfürsorge &amp; quot ; ( an infant care institution ) and a &amp; quot ; Säuglingsheilstatt &amp; quot ; ( nursing home for infants ) . In 1904 , he was appointed an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Halle , soon afterwards relocating to Munich as chair of pediatrics at the academy of practical medicine .
In 1919 he moved to the University of Cologne as a professor of pediatrics . Siegert is remembered for his work with infectious diseases , especially diphtheria .
He was particularly interested in the inheritability of rickets as well as the nutritional needs of children ( protein requirements ) .
Dabney Post OfficeThe Dabney Post Office is a historic post office located on Kentucky Route 39 in Dabney , Kentucky .
The one-story wood frame building served as Dabney &amp; apos ; s community store and post office .
Ped May built the post office around 1900 ; May ran both the store and the post office .
The post office served as the social hub of Dabney , a common function of combination store and post office buildings in Pulaski County ; the Dabney Post Office is one of the few surviving buildings of this type .
The post office closed in the 1960s . The post office was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14 , 1984 .
Freefall : America , Free Markets , and the Sinking of the World EconomyFreefall : America , Free Markets , and the Sinking of the World Economy is a book on the causes and consequences of the Great Recession by economist and Nobel laureate Joseph E .
Stiglitz , first published in 2010 by W .
W .
Norton &amp; amp ; Company .
While focusing on the roots of the financial crisis of 2007-08 and the subsequent global economic slowdown , which he claims to find mainly in fiscal policy as conducted during the Bush presidency and decisions made by the Federal Reserve , Stiglitz also talks about the failure to cope with the recession during the months succeeding the Wall Street Crash of 2008 .
Finally , he sketches various schemes as to the possible future of the American economy , vigorously proposing a profound policy shift .
In compliance with Stiglitz &amp; apos ; s general attitude towards economic policy , &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; contains &amp; quot ; proposals to tame the banking sector and to foster a more humanistic style of capitalism in the United States and abroad . &amp; quot ; According to an assessment written by Larry Elliott for &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; , the book &amp; quot ; reeks of &amp; apos ; I told you so &amp; apos ; . &amp; quot ; because during the years preceding the crisis , Stiglitz had &amp; quot ; warned policy makers repeatedly that the United States was headed toward a deep , painful recession if pre-emptive interventions were not made . &amp; quot ; The title of the book points at the sharp decline in stock prices following the bankruptcy of the investment bank &amp; quot ; Lehman Brothers &amp; quot ; in September , 2008 .
Meanwhile , its subtitle reveals Stiglitz &amp; apos ; s conviction that free markets are at the bottom of the crisis , as he makes deregulation responsible for the rise of the shadow banking system , over-leveraged banks and subprime mortgages .
Accordingly , in &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; Stiglitz criticizes advocates of deregulation and free markets , most notoriously Larry Summers and Ben Bernanke . The book which is &amp; quot ; rife with ( . . . ) indignation &amp; quot ; consists of ten chapters , some of which analyze the causes of the Great Recession while others cover the subsequent - and as per Stiglitz flawed - crisis management .
Still others look ahead and serve the purpose of explaining Stiglitz &amp; apos ; s proposal for &amp; quot ; a reassessment of the sort of economy in which financiers enriched themselves by selling over-priced and risky products to some of the most vulnerable citizens in America . &amp; quot ; Stiglitz grants a large share of the blame for the Great Recession to George W .
Bush and his far-reaching tax cuts for wealthy Americans .
He also attacks Bush &amp; apos ; s successor Barack Obama for practically continuing with that fiscal policy .
According to Stiglitz , Obama &amp; apos ; s decision to stick with both Ben Bernanke and Larry Summers , is sufficient proof for the president &amp; apos ; s refusal to alter the course .
However , not all of Stiglitz &amp; apos ; s criticism is aimed at the White House , as he also attacks the Federal Reserve under the leadership of first Alan Greenspan and then Ben Bernanke .
Moreover , he mentions the danger of economic interconnectedness and globalization , stating that by &amp; quot ; purchasing enormous amounts of U . S .
debt in the form of T-bills and treasury issuances , the Chinese have helped to maintain artificially low interest rates and the accompanying American debt-driven consumption patterns . &amp; quot ; Common thread of &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; is Stiglitz &amp; apos ; s conviction that deregulation and the subsequent lack of transparency in the financial sector are responsible for the severity of the Great Recession .
He consequently considers regulation a requirement for solid recovery and expressed concern regarding economic policy as performed during Barack Obama &amp; apos ; s first months as president in an interview with &amp; quot ; The New York Times &amp; quot ; : Thus &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; also promotes to undo the 1999 repeal of the regulative Glass-Steagall Act , with Stiglitz depicting it as necessary in order to eradicate the contamination of the banking sector : A central theme of &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; is the notion of &amp; quot ; incentives &amp; quot ; and the distorted incentive structures that allowed the financial crisis to happen .
In the first chapter , Stiglitz mentions that on one hand : &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; One of the arguments put forward by many in the financial markets for not helping mortgage owners is that ( . . . ) incentives to repay are weakened if mortgage owners know that there is some chance they will be helped out if they don &amp; apos ; t repay &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
While on the other hand : &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; When it came to America &amp; apos ; s big banks ( . . . ) concerns about moral hazard were shunted aside , so much so as the bank officers were allowed to enjoy huge bonuses for record losses &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
Then , throughout his book , Stiglitz explains how almost every decision maker in the financial system had incentives to create a housing bubble , record high profits and pass on the risk to others as externalities . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Before the arrival of modern innovations in finance ( . . . ) banks held on to the loans they originated , they had &amp; # 91 ; incentives &amp; # 93 ; to be careful . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; But Stiglitz shows that with deregulation and the arrival of modern financial innovations , it turned out otherwise .
With the securitization process , banks had incentives to make as much bad mortgages as possible .
Those bad mortgages were &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; repackaged and ( . . ) passed on to investors , including pension funds . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; With this process , it didn &amp; apos ; t matter anymore to the banks that the home owners would go bankrupt because the loss would be passed on to investors and ordinary citizens ( through pension funds ) .
An other key element in this system was the credit rating agencies .
In fact , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; to buy the &amp; # 91 ; bad mortgages &amp; # 93 ; , managers of pension funds had to be sure ( . . . ) they were safe . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; To make sure that these mortgages would be bought by pension funds , banks were paying the rating agencies to get AAA ratings .
Thus , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; like everyone else in the sector , &amp; # 91 ; rating agencies &amp; apos ; s &amp; # 93 ; incentives were distorted .
( . . . ) They were being paid by the banks that originated the securities they were asked to rate &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; was generally well received by critics , although some expressed doubts as to the feasibility of Stiglitz &amp; apos ; s proposals for change . &amp; quot ; The New York Times &amp; quot ; , for instance , stated that the contents of &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; may all be worthy ideas .
But &amp; # 91 ; that &amp; # 93 ; at times , Mr .
Stiglitz ’ s call for a new economic order seems a bit fanciful . &amp; quot ; In an earlier review , Michiko Kakutani went even further , criticzing that his &amp; quot ; remarks not only give ammunition to conservative critics who want to dismiss Mr .
Stiglitz as a European-style liberal , but &amp; # 91 ; that &amp; # 93 ; they also have the unfortunate effect of diverting the reader ’ s attention from the many shrewd assessments that he makes in &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; about the causes and consequences of the great financial meltdown of 2008 . &amp; quot ; In a review run by &amp; quot ; The Observer &amp; quot ; , economist Will Hutton expressed more optimism , claiming that &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; i &amp; # 93 ; t requires bravery to take on the vested interests – along with good ideas and a strong sense of the right trajectory .
At present we have too little of any of them .
Stiglitz &amp; apos ; s book successfully redresses the balance .
It is very welcome – and important . &amp; quot ; The &amp; quot ; New Statesman &amp; quot ; rather focused on shortcomings of &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; : &amp; quot ; In an impressive final chapter , Stiglitz takes apart the theorists of market fundamentalism - for their abstractness , their failure to see where economics should stop and sociology begin .
But his own economics seem shorn of a social and political dimension : whether you choose Foucault , Marx or C .
Wright Mills , if you are a critic of the capitalist system you must have some explanation of why it goes on producing power elites who stand in the way of attempts to control it .
This is the crucial element missing from Stiglitz &amp; apos ; s analytical framework . &amp; quot ; The French economist Guy Sorman , author of the libertarian book &amp; quot ; Economics Does Not Lie &amp; quot ; , showed himself sceptical about &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; , stating that its author &amp; quot ; feels compelled to remind the reader that he is not a socialist : he only advocates a better world .
His utopia would replace the failed market fundamentalism by striking the right balance between market and state .
( . . . ) Stiglitz ’ s Nobel Prize on market asymmetry was well deserved .
His opinions on everything else are just opinions and deserve to be treated as such . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; The Economist &amp; quot ; juxtaposed &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; in opposition to &amp; quot ; 13 Bankers &amp; quot ; , a slightly later published book with similar contents by Simon Johnson and James Kwak .
Neither of the books was given a positive assessment , with &amp; quot ; Freefall &amp; quot ; being criticized for argumentative inconsistency : &amp; quot ; If policymakers failed as miserably as Mr Stiglitz believes , then he ought to be far more worried about the potential for government failure in the future .
That dissonance is a glaring weakness in Mr Stiglitz &amp; apos ; s book . &amp; quot ;

Philippine National Shooting AssociationThe Philippine National Shooting Association ( PNSA ) is the National Sports Association ( NSA ) governing shooting sports in the Philippines , covering both Olympic discipline shooting sports and non-Olympic shooting events like the bench rest or practical pistol .
PNSA is the Philippine shooting sport NSA recognized by and a regular member of the Philippine Olympic Committee ( POC ) , funded by the Philippine Sports Commission ( PSC ) . The PNSA is an accredited member of the International Shooting Sport Federation ( ISSF ) , the governing body of international shooting sports , headquartered in Germany .
The Philippine National Shooting Association is also an accredited member of the Asian Shooting Confederation ( ASC ) and Asian Clay Shooting Federation . The Philippine National Shooting Association ( PNSA ) is a non-stock , non-profit organization of Philippine shooting sport enthusiasts and athletes . In the last quarter of 2007 , PNSA signed a memorandum of agreement with PhilSPADA - the Philippine Sports Association of Differently Abled - National Paralympic Committee , to provide assistance and support in the development of target shooting for athletes with a physical impairment .
Just like their able-bodied counterparts , Paralympic shooters use the same guns , clothing and equipment , with a few modifications like shooting tables and chairs . International Paralympic Committee Shooting ( IPC Shooting ) uses a classification system to determine events shooters with impairments may compete in as well as rules adapted from the International Shooting Sport Federation ( ISSF ) . The PNSA-PSC Shooting Ranges for 10 meter , 25 meter and 50 meter events are located in the Marines area of Fort Bonifacio , Taguig City while the PNSA Clay Target Range for Trap and Skeet events is in Muntinlupa .
During the 2005 Southeast Asian Games , the ranges were used as the shooting competition venues .
All PNSA-PSC Shooting Ranges are only open for use to members . In mid-2012 the first electronic target system was installed on 10 firing points in the 10 meter Air Shooting Range .
Shot locations recorded by target sensors show up on the monitors of National Training Pool shooters giving instant shot feedback .
This increases accuracy to match performance of contemporaries using similar electronic target facilities abroad .
The ISSF 2013-2016 Rule Changes require decimal scoring to replace whole number scoring . Both youth and adult shooters compete locally in the yearly National Open , a series of monthly shooting events .
The top performing shooters are chosen for the National Training Pool which receives support like ammunition , an allowance or both .
This is followed by monthly competitions , where shooters strive to achieve their event &amp; apos ; s Minimum Qualification Scores ( MQS ) , currently pegged as the bronze score from the last Asian Games for selection to compete in international shooting events , starting with regional level events leading up to the Olympic Games .

Crime in South KoreaCrime in South Korea is among the lowest compared to other developed nations . Violent crimes ( such as homicide , assault and arson ) and property crimes ( such as theft , fraud and vandalism ) make up around four-fifths of all Criminal Code OffencesAlthough South Korea has a lower crime rate than other industrialized countries , the crime rate in 2007 was around 2 . 9 times higher than in 1978 , with the total number of crimes committed rising from 513,165 to 1,965,577 .
On occasion , sudden changes in circumstance have led to cause short-term fluctuations in the crime rate – for example , the crime rate rose by 15 % following the 1997 Asian financial crisis , and dropped by 21 % during the first ten days of the 2002 FIFA World Cup .
There is also a problem in the nation with foreign criminals targeting it due to its relatively affluent status and the perception that it has lax security .
1 . 4 percent of crimes in the nation are committed by foreigners , which is quite low considering the 3 . 5 % of the population is non-Korean .
According to British criminal Colin Blaney in his autobiography &amp; apos ; Undesirables &amp; apos ; , the country is targeted by English , Canadian , American and German criminals . South Korea has undergone dramatic social , economic and political upheaval since the end of the Korean War in 1953 .
With these changes crime has increased in recent years and has become a major issue in South Korea .
Most of the increase has come in the form of violence and illegal activities connected to organized groups ( Lee , 2006 ) . Due to the large police and military presence after the Korean War , the expansion of home-grown organized crime was slowed , almost giving South Korea immunity against international criminal organizations .
With no outside conflicts South Korean organized crime has had an advantage to grow , yet because of the location of the Korean peninsula many outside groups from Russia , Japan and China have started to engage in more illegal activities in South Korea ( Lee , 2006 ) . Amid the political confusion of the 1950s , a number of organized gangs emerged and became an influential force in the entertainment districts .
Soon these groups began associating with politicians , guarding them from danger and disrupting the political rallies of competing politicians by using organized violence .
These particular groups were the so-called “ political gangs ” or “ henchmen ” ( Lee , 2006 ) Organized crime after the War started mainly in the city of Seoul , the capital city of South Korea .
Two main gangs formed , the first was known as the “ Chong-ro Faction ” which was made up of members from southern Korea , and the second was known as the “ Myung-dong Faction ” whose members where from Pyonyando province .
These two gangs claimed dominance over northern Seoul .
With the military in control , in the years from 1961 to 1963 13,000 members of these gangs were arrested causing organized gangs to almost completely disappear ( Lee , 2006 ) .
The 1970s brought an easing of public discipline and control , and opportunities for organized crime emerged again .
This saw the emergence of two new groups known as the “ Master Sergeant Shin Faction ” which was located in the Seoul area and the “ Ho-nam Faction ” found in the Mugyo-dong area of Seoul .
In 1975 there was a violent battle over territories among the two groups which ended with the Ho-nam Faction becoming victorious .
The Ho-nam Fraction soon divided into three sub-factions due to internal conflicts .
These three factions are now considered the largest organized crime groups in South Korea .
They are known as the “ Seo-bang Faction , ” the “ Yang-eun Faction ” and the “ OB Faction ” ( Lee , 2006 ) . Traditional South Korean criminal groups fights rarely resulted in deaths as they fought with their hands , feet and heads .
Knives and metal bars only began to show up as weapons in the 1970s .
In today ’ s South Korean society , a person is not to be in possession of guns , swords or knives which may explain why traditional crime groups did not use weapons ( Lee , 2006 ) . Upon the assassination of President Park in 1979 “ special measures to uproot social evils ” were initiated under the proclaimed martial law which led to a decline in organized criminal violence .
But with the relaxed atmosphere these criminal organizations remerged and flourished yet again ( Lee , 2006 ) .
With the 1985 Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics global expansion became a possibility and criminal groups took advantage of this opportunity for rapid economic development .
Taking advantage of the Korean government &amp; apos ; s open-door and globalization policies , these crime groups began to form coalitions with their counterparts in Japan , China , Hong Kong , and the United States ( Lee , 2006 ) . In 1990 the Korean Government declared a “ war on crime ” in an effort to crack down on violent and non-violent acts by criminally organized groups .
The raids in the fall of 1990 crippled most of the existing criminal groups , but did not destroy them .
As one way of better controlling the number of criminal groups , the Korean Government made it illegal to form or join any criminal organization .
Statistics from the Supreme Prosecutor ’ s Office showed that in 1999 there were 11,500 members from 404 organized crimes groups ranging from 10 to 88 members in South Korea ( Lee , 2006 ) . With the trend of economic growth and globalization , organized crime groups in South Korea have become larger in scale and broader in their fields of operations .
These international linkages have started to include drug trafficking , financial fraud , weapons smuggling , and human trafficking .
Organized transnational crime has become a major concern facing not only Korean government , but also the international community ( Lee , 2006 ) . The use of drugs in South Korea is a lesser offense ; however , there are still drug related offenses in South Korea .
Most of the drug related offenses occur in the Gangnam and Yongsan Districts .
In 2013 , there were 129 drug related crimes reported in the Gangnam area and 48 drug related crimes reported in the Yongsan area . A Gangnam District representative said , “ drugs are usually distributed through the club network , in Gangnam , foreign students and club operators tend to be involved in the drug trade , a relatively easy way to make money . ” According to the Supreme Prosecutors ’ Office , there were 7,011 arrests for drug offenses in 2011 which was a 7 percent drop from the previous year .
The U . S . , by way of comparison , in 2010 made more than 1 . 6 million drug arrests , more than 36 times Korea ’ s figure , even after differences in population are accounted for .
The drug that is most common is Crystalline Methamphetamine also known as Crystal Meth . Crystal Meth remains the most commonly used drug , accounting for most drug related arrests .
Other drugs that are well known are club drugs such as ecstasy .
These continue to grow in popularity among college students .
However , methamphetamine continues to be the drug of choice for Koreans . In South Korea , murder is an uncommon , but serious , crime .
Gangseo District and Yeongdeungpo Districts are the two most well-known areas where murders happen most often .
In 2013 , there were 21 murder cases in the Gangseo District and 11 murder cases in the Yeongdeungpo District .
These two districts are found on the southwest part of the city where it houses many low income citizens and foreign workers . A Dongguk University Police Administration professor , Kwak Dae-gyung said , “ there are many foreign residents that have yet to adapt to Korean society and citizens lower in the economic strata in these areas , there ’ s trouble in terms of economic competition and a lengthy period of cultural assimilation that leads to people committing violent crimes out of frustration and the need for frequent police action . South Korea dropped one notch in an international corruption awareness ranking to 46th place among 177 nations in 2013 .
According to the 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index ( CPI ) issued by Transparency International ( TI ) , South Korea scored 55 out of 100 .
Corruption Perceptions Index .
The index shows qualitative assessments of a country &amp; apos ; s level of corruption in the administrative and public sectors giving a yearly view of the relative degree of corruption by ranking countries from all over the globe .
It uses data taken from opinion surveys of experts from each country .
The reputation of the country &amp; apos ; s law enforcement agency has recently been tarnished after a number of ranking government officials , including the head of the state intelligence agency , were indicted for alleged bribery . Some 86 . 5 percent of respondents in a Korea Institute of Public Administration survey of small and large companies described corruption among high-ranking public officials as “ serious ” in 2010 , the highest result since the poll began in 2000 .
Transparency International , a corruption watchdog , gave South Korea a rating of 5 . 4 in its 2010 corruption perceptions index — midway between highly corrupt and very clean .
That ranks South Korea alongside countries and territories such as Botswana , Puerto Rico and Poland but far below many of the developed nations it has sought to emulate . Prostitution in South Korea is illegal , but according to The Korea Women &amp; apos ; s Development Institute 여성부 , the sex trade in the country was estimated to amount to 14 trillion South Korean won ( $ 13 billion ) in 2007 , roughly 1 . 6 percent of the nation &amp; apos ; s gross domestic product .
In 2003 , the Korean Institute of Criminology announced that 260,000 women , or 1 of 25 of young Korean women , may be engaged in the sex industry .
However , the Korean Feminist Association alleged that from 514,000 to 1 . 2 million Korean women participate in the prostitution industry .
In addition , a similar report by the Institute noted that 20 % of men in their 20s pay for sex at least four times a month , with 358,000 visiting prostitutes daily . The sex trade involved some 94 million transactions in 2007 , down from 170 million in 2002 .
The number of prostitutes dropped by 18 percent to 269,000 during the same period .
The amount of money traded for prostitution was over 14 trillion won , compared to than 24 trillion won in 2002 .
Despite legal sanctions and police crackdowns , prostitution continues to flourish in the country , while sex workers continue to actively resist the state &amp; apos ; s activities .

Nothing Like a DameNothing Like a Dame : The Scandals of Shirley Porter is a 2006 biography by British journalist Andrew Hosken .
The book was first published on 1 October 2006 through Granta UK and discusses British politician Shirley Porter &amp; apos ; s time served as a member of the Westminster City Council . The book discusses Porter &amp; apos ; s time served under the Westminster City Council and the resulting fallout .
Hosken also includes several interviews and looks into Porter &amp; apos ; s history as the daughter of Jack Cohen . &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; gave a positive review for &amp; quot ; Nothing Like A Dame &amp; quot ; , calling it &amp; quot ; enthralling &amp; quot ; .
Bloomberg gave a more mixed review , remarking that it was &amp; quot ; riveting &amp; quot ; but also &amp; quot ; uneven &amp; quot ; .
In contrast , &amp; quot ; The Contemporary Review &amp; quot ; praised Hosken &amp; apos ; s research .
Jay Rayner , reviewing for &amp; quot ; The Observer &amp; quot ; , felt that the book was : &amp; quot ; probably as comprehensive an account of Porter &amp; apos ; s time in power , and the bullying , plotting , maladministration and corruption that went with it , as we are likely to get . &amp; quot ; Francis Beckett described it as : &amp; quot ; a splendid book , as easy to read as a good thriller . . .
It &amp; apos ; s also very thorough , with an immense amount of detail , presented remarkably digestibly . &amp; quot ; Christian Wolmar wrote that the book : &amp; quot ; tells the story brilliantly , often with greatly enlightening and entertaining detail , and breaking up the chronology to deal with the various individual scandals which individually are shocking enough but together suggest that the very basis of the administration was corrupt . &amp; quot ; On the negative side , Wolmar was critical of the lack of references , &amp; quot ; a result of the publisher seeking to keep it to a manageable length but hopefully an omission that will be remedied in the paperback version as this is a subject ripe for future generations to study as a classic failure of governance . &amp; quot ; The cover of the book consists of a photograph of Porter which she had posed for use in a feature article about her in &amp; quot ; The Sunday Times &amp; quot ; .
Jenny Diski , for the &amp; quot ; London Review of Books &amp; quot ; , was , however , critical of the cover , writing : . . . the picture on the front of Hosken &amp; apos ; s book is of Porter as a racial caricature .
Bright lumps of gold adorn her ears and finger , brass buttons decorate her blazer , a gold smiley-face pendant hangs round her neck , the most garish of orange lipstick outlines her lips , her arms are arrogantly akimbo , her less than gracile facial features perform an ugly , over-bronzed sneer of contempt .
She is outsized against the background , looming over London , the curse of the 50-foot woman , lording it over and diminishing the Houses of Parliament and the City : common as muck and in control .
Call me oversensitive , but she &amp; apos ; s not just dreadful , she &amp; apos ; s so &amp; quot ; Jewish &amp; quot ; . Nicholas Lezard , for &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; , countered : To get to the substance of the book you are going to have to surmount the considerable obstacle of its front cover .
Diski calls this a &amp; quot ; racial caricature &amp; quot ; , but it &amp; apos ; s not , it &amp; apos ; s a photograph , of Porter in her prime : the contemptuous stare , the alarming lipstick , the shoulder-pads . Lezard was also dismissive of Diski &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; detection of &amp; # 93 ; a trace of anti-semitism in patrician attitudes to Porter , &amp; quot ; calling it &amp; quot ; understandable , but to which one reasonable counter-claim might be that it didn &amp; apos ; t stop her from becoming leader of Westminster council . &amp; quot ; In December 2009 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a Friday Play , described as a &amp; quot ; tragic comedy &amp; quot ; , based upon Hosken &amp; apos ; s book .
The radio play , &amp; quot ; Shirleymander &amp; quot ; , was written by Gregory Evans , directed by Marc Beeby and starred Tracy-Ann Oberman as Shirley Porter .
Reception for the radio drama was positive , with &amp; quot ; The Daily Telegraph &amp; quot ; praising Beeby for his casting and choice of music . The book was the subject of an early day motion tabled in the House of Commons on 20 April 2006 &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; congratulating &amp; # 93 ; BBC Today reporter Andy Hosken on his book , &amp; quot ; Nothing Like a Dame &amp; quot ; , recounting the story of Dame Shirley Porter &amp; apos ; s regime at Westminster City Council . . . &amp; quot ; The motion went on to &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; call &amp; # 93 ; upon the Government to recommend to Her Majesty the Queen , that the honour of &amp; # 91 ; Porter &amp; apos ; s &amp; # 93 ; DBE should be withdrawn , it having been awarded under false pretences , and representing an affront to those whose public service genuinely merits such recognition . &amp; quot ;

Theatre Three ( Dallas ) Theatre Three ( sometimes styled Theatre3 ) is a Dallas theatrical company established in 1961 by Norma Young .
Originally working from the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel , the theater moved to a location at 2211 Main Street in the Deep Ellum area , eventually settling in The Quadrangle in 1969 . Theatre Three ( sometimes styled Theatre3 ) is a Dallas theatrical company established in 1961 .
Theatre Three has been known as the “ second ” theater in town , after the Dallas Theater Center ( which opened in 1960 — a year before Theatre Three ) . It all started in 1960 when a young off-Broadway actress / stage-manager , Norma Young , returned to her home in Dallas in 1960 to care for her ailing mother .
It was Norma ’ s idea to establish the theater in 1961 , having received a small inheritance from a great-aunt .
And she convinced three others to join her : Esther Ragland , Robert Dracup and Jac Alder , who had met Young when she cast him in a community theater production of Pirandello ’ s Six Characters In Search of an Author .
Their theater started a seven-show season in the Sheraton Dallas Hotel ballroom — and the two married on July 1 , 1961 . Theatre Three ’ s name was chosen because of Young ’ s belief that for theater to succeed , it required three essential elements : author , actors and audience . Young was inspired by Margo Jones , Dallas ’ original theater patron saint , who championed “ theater-in-the-round ” when she created Theater ’ 47 , one of the original , residential theater companies in the United States .
Young liked the intimacy of the format .
More than 50 years after it started , Theater Three remains a theater-in-the-round in its 242-seat space in the Quadrangle . After its first season , Theatre Three moved into a remodeled car-seat factory on Main Street in Deep Ellum .
It may have become a safe , “ established ” theater in recent decades , but it was actually the city ’ s first “ off-Broadway ” theater company .
It gave such writers as Harold Pinter , Edward Albee and Samuel Beckett their North Texas premieres .
By 1969 , however , it had outgrown that Main Street facility as well .
It eventually leased space in what was then a brand-new development , the Quadrangle , in what had been known for decades as the State-Thomas area ( named for two streets crossing there ) .
Real-estate developers have since renamed it Uptown .
The theatre houses two spaces , the Norma Young Arena Stage and the studio theatre space called Theatre Too . But by the mid-80s , Theatre Three faced a severe financial crisis .
At one point , Alder even called a press conference to declare he would be forced to shut the theater down in a few months .
They had no liquidity , no line of credit left , nothing to pay the bills to keep the theater going .
He explained that back when there were Texas-based banks — back before the savings-and-loan scandal wiped out many of them or they were bought up by giants like Citibank — he could ask his local banker to let him float the theater for a month or two , to get past a tight cash-flow crunch like this .
No more . Van Kaplan — then the head of Fort Worth ’ s Casa Manana , now the executive producer of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera — advised Alder not to pull the plug .
He convinced Alder there were still avenues he could pursue , a lot of goodwill in the community he could tap into .
Instead of folding , the theater actually rebounded and — aided by its board and by the Texas real-estate recession that followed a calamitous drop in oil prices — in 1985 Alder actually bought the theater ’ s home in the Quadrangle . Theatre Three inspired a number of notable talents — including TV star Morgan Fairchild , playwright Beth Henley ( Crimes of the Heart ) , Tracy Letts ( August : Osage County ) and , in particular , playwright Doug Wright , who won the Pulitzer Prize for I Am My Own Wife .
In something of a heartfelt homecoming , Wright ’ s Broadway musical Hands on a Hard Body was staged by Theatre Three in 2014 and Wright re-visited .
“ I spent the bulk of my childhood in these halls , ” Wright said , “ or in the Teen / Children ’ s Theater Program , as it was called , at the Dallas Theater Center .
And those two institutions enabled me , as a nervous young gay kid in Texas , to survive childhood . ” Theater Three has been a leader in diversity and has been open to all artists regardless of color , ethnicity , creed or proclivity from the start — it was desegregated long before many other leading Dallas institutions were .
Theatre Three pioneered bringing socially conscious dramas to Dallas by such writers as Athol Fugard and August Wilson .
Alder himself served on the Texas Commission on the Arts and was on the board of Texas Non-Profit Theatres . Theatre Three is also responsible for the longest running show in Dallas theater history , I Love You , You ’ re Perfect , Now Change , which ran for three years before switching to an annual limited run timed to the Valentine ’ s Day season . Until 2003 , Theatre Three was the only leading arts organization in the Dallas area that owned its facility — unlike the Dallas Theater Center , Dallas Opera , etc .
— all of which receive city support and a city-owned building . Norma Young continued as the theatre ’ s founding Artistic Director until her death in 1998 .
Jac Alder remained with the theatre and continued to serve as the Executive Producer-Director in charge of both artistic and administrative affairs until his death , due to respiratory failure , on May 22 , 2015 .
As of that date , Alder had been the longest-serving artistic director of an American resident theater company in history and in July 2011 , he was awarded AEA Life Membership card by Actors ’ Equity . http : / / artandseek . net / 2015 / 05 / 22 / dallas-theater-mainstay-jac-alder-has-died / by Jerome Weeks

Super Time ForceSuper Time Force is a side-scrolling action and shooter video game by Capybara Games , The game was released for the Xbox One and the Xbox 360 on May 14 , 2014 .
The game was known for its mechanic ability for players to rewind themselves using the &amp; quot ; Time Out &amp; quot ; game mechanic back to an area where they started from when a character dies , and then resume their action alongside a ghost version of the said character .
Its game mechanics and gameplay were inspired by other side-scrolling titles like &amp; quot ; Contra &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Metal Slug &amp; quot ; with the abilities of time-travel . The game was later released with an updated version entitled Super Time Force Ultra on the Xbox platforms , and Microsoft Windows through Steam and GOG . com on August 25 , 2014 , and on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on September 1 , 2015 .
Since its release , the game has received critical acclaim and awards for its humorous storytelling , gameplay , and original game mechanics . Players have 30 lives to run through bullet hell levels .
When the player dies or voluntarily ends the run , the player can view and rewind their timestream to revisit the life of a prior player-character &amp; apos ; s run or otherwise restart with a new run .
There are over 16 different characters in each of the 6 stages with different weapons or powers of their own .
In addition , the player can also use items like &amp; quot ; cloxs &amp; quot ; ( clock items that reverse the time limit ) , shards ( violet dust-like pixels that allow the player and the game &amp; apos ; s time limit to pass in slow motion ; they are only visible if the player uses the &amp; quot ; Time Out &amp; quot ; mechanic ) and &amp; quot ; glorbs &amp; quot ; ( yellow diamond shaped items that increase the player &amp; apos ; s number of lives by one , and are found on every level on certain areas or in enemies that are difficult to capture ) .
Both shards and glorbs can be collected to unlock a new character when a certain amount is obtained . Commander Repeatski sends the Super Time Force , a time-traveling military organization , to various points in history such as prehistoric times , middle ages , and the future in order to make the present a better place to live . The game stems from a three-day experiment at the Toronto , Ontario Game Jam in May 2011 .
The game jam event coalesced hundreds of Toronto-area game developers to build quick prototypes around a central theme : the phrase &amp; quot ; what just happened &amp; quot ; .
Kenneth Yeung of Capybara and artists Mike and Vic Nguyen brainstormed as a three-person team and decided to make a time-traveling side-scrolling shooter , &amp; quot ; a &amp; quot ; Contra &amp; quot ; game where you can go back in time . &amp; quot ; This quickly became the core feature , where upon death , the player fought &amp; quot ; alongside ghost versions of themselves doing what they had just done before they died . &amp; quot ; Dying created co-op partners of the player &amp; apos ; s recorded actions .
Yeung described it as , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Gunstar Heroes &amp; quot ; meets that one level in &amp; quot ; Braid &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; Capy released a gameplay teaser trailer on October 17 , 2011 without explaining the footage .
Around the same time , Microsoft awarded the game the 2012 Independent Games Festival &amp; quot ; XBLA Award &amp; quot ; , a deal to publish the game on Xbox Live Arcade .
Capy creative director Kris Piotrowski described the night as &amp; quot ; a bit of a pinnacle moment &amp; quot ; for the company and the risks it had taken .
The deal did not have specific deadlines .
The game debuted at PAX East 2012 without marketing .
Capy president Nathan Vella told &amp; quot ; Polygon &amp; quot ; that they wanted players to discover the game organically without having the concept spoiled .
He also felt that the direct approach to gamers would create a small but loyal fan base , which the company preferred over broad marketing .
By PAX Prime 2012 , Capy had removed mechanics where charging attacks depleted the time-life meter , and added multipliers ( across multiple lives ) for consecutive kills .
In 2012 , &amp; quot ; Super Time Force &amp; quot ; demos appeared at the Los Angeles iam8bit , &amp; quot ; Polygon &amp; quot ; s E3 party , and the annual Evolution fighting game tournament . The core mechanic was redesigned by PAX East 2013 .
The game was easy for players who died often , as they would be helped by the ghosts , yet left experts at a disadvantage : improving at the game meant dying less and therefore using the ghost players ( the core mechanics ) less .
The development team decided that players should be in control of time in order to make players use death strategically , and rethought the mechanic to let the player rewind and replay the lives of previous runs from a timeline upon death . The game was delayed until its released on May 14 , 2014 to the Xbox One .
It was also released to Windows on August 25 , 2014 and to the PlayStation platforms on September 1 , 2015 . &amp; quot ; Super Time Force &amp; quot ; received favorable reviews from critics for its story , characters , colorful pixelated graphics , references to pop culture , and the unique ability for players to rewind back where they left off after their character dies using its game mechanic on each level &amp; apos ; s area as its checkpoint . &amp; quot ; Game Informer &amp; quot ; &amp; apos ; s Matt Miller praised its playability and explained , &amp; quot ; the reimagining of how we perceive time in an action game is what makes it memorable . &amp; quot ; Critics have pointed out some mild flaws to its repetitive life-saving throughout the game &amp; apos ; s time-out layers was seen somewhat confusing and overwhelming , but have still find its gameplay an enjoyable experience .
&amp; quot ; Kotaku &amp; quot ; commented that the game &amp; quot ; Feels a lot more tactical and technically impressive that it initially appears . &amp; quot ; But also added , &amp; quot ; Manipulating time in video games isn &amp; apos ; t a new thing , but the way that &amp; quot ; STF &amp; quot ; uses the gimmick feels fresh and clever .
Rewinding and playing through a chunk of game over and over creates hectic layers of action .
It &amp; apos ; s chaotic but beautiful . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Super Time Force &amp; quot ; won &amp; quot ; Gamespot &amp; quot ; &amp; apos ; s Game of the Month Award of May 2014 , The press also have added that the game &amp; quot ; assumes a hilariously cavalier attitude about the rights and wrongs of fiddling with time , sending up every sci-fi time travel trope in the book . &amp; quot ; At the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers ( NAVGTR ) awards the game was nominated for &amp; quot ; Game Design , New IP &amp; quot ; . Arthur Gies of &amp; quot ; Polygon &amp; quot ; was impressed by its often nonsensical narrative and concept and describe it as &amp; quot ; The dumbest smart shooter I &amp; apos ; ve ever played .
The face it wears is the goofy nostalgist that can &amp; apos ; t be serious for even a moment , sure .
But Capy &amp; apos ; s implentation of time travel and control is inspired enough to shine new light on even its most tired-but-excellently-executed inspirations . &amp; quot ; In a 2013 interview with ScrewAttack at PAX , Capy president Nathan Vella was asked about the game &amp; apos ; s character Zackasaurus sharing some resemblance to late 80 &amp; apos ; s and early 90 &amp; apos ; s personas , Vella explain that &amp; quot ; The Simpsons &amp; quot ; sketch series , &amp; quot ; The Itchy &amp; amp ; Scratchy Show &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; character Poochie might be an inspiration to the character . Jordan Devore of &amp; quot ; Destructoid &amp; quot ; quoted &amp; quot ; A satisfying run-and-gun game made even better with a fun ( and funny ! ) take on time travel . &amp; quot ; He continued , &amp; quot ; You &amp; apos ; ll likely be able to burn through the game in a few hours if you &amp; apos ; re not going for full completion , but it has such a winning personality that you &amp; apos ; ll find yourself coming back for more . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Super Time Force Ultra &amp; quot ; , abbreviated as &amp; quot ; STFU &amp; quot ; , was released on August 25 , 2014 , Which features over 50 mission levels via the &amp; quot ; Helladeck &amp; quot ; , the Steam version of the game features guest characters owned by Valve , such as the Pyro and Saxton Hale from &amp; quot ; Team Fortress 2 &amp; quot ; and Zoey from &amp; quot ; Left 4 Dead &amp; quot ; .
The PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita version of &amp; quot ; Ultra &amp; quot ; features Sony Computer Entertainment chairman Shuhei Yoshida as a playable character along with The Traveler from &amp; quot ; Journey &amp; quot ; and Sir Galahad from &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; . Jean Rambois makes a cameo appearance in &amp; quot ; Mercenary Kings &amp; quot ; when the player can encounter him and receive a new weapon , Zackasaurus appears in Indivisible as a playable character .
Several characters from &amp; quot ; Super Time Force &amp; quot ; are also featured as part of a downloadable skin pack for the sandbox game &amp; quot ; Minecraft &amp; quot ; .

Oleg TsvetkovskiyOleg Tsvetkovskiy ( ; born May 27 , 1970 ) is an Uzbek former swimmer , who specialized in sprint and middle-distance freestyle events .
He represented Uzbekistan in two editions of the Olympic Games ( 1996 and 2000 ) , since the nation &amp; apos ; s breakup from the Soviet Union . Tsvetkovskiy made his official debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta .
He failed to reach the top 16 final in the 100 m freestyle , finishing forty-eighth in a time of 52 . 39 .
A member of the Uzbek team , he also placed seventeenth in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay ( 3 : 28 . 33 ) , and twelfth in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay ( 7 : 40 . 60 ) . At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , Tsvetkovskiy competed only in two swimming events .
He eclipsed a FINA B-cut of 1 : 55 . 29 ( 200 m freestyle ) from the Asian Championships in Busan , South Korea .
On the first day of the Games , he teamed up with Ravil Nachaev , Petr Vasiliev , and Oleg Pukhnatiy in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay .
Although he swam the second leg in heat one , his team had been disqualified due to an early relay takeoff by Pukhnatiy .
The following day , in the 200 m freestyle , Tsvetkovskiy placed forty-fourth on the morning prelims .
He edged out Egypt &amp; apos ; s Mahmoud El-Wany to lead the first heat by 0 . 26 of a second in a lifetime best of 1 : 54 . 93 .
Hoffman nucleation theoryHoffman nucleation theory is a theory developed by John D .
Hoffman and coworkers in the 1970s and 80s that attempts to describe the crystallization of a polymer in terms of the kinetics and thermodynamics of polymer surface nucleation .
The theory introduces a model where a surface of completely crystalline polymer is created and introduces surface energy parameters to describe the process .
Hoffman nucleation theory is more of a starting point for polymer crystallization theory and is better known for its fundamental roles in the Hoffman-Weeks Lamellar Thickening and Lauritzen-Hoffman Growth Theory . Polymers contain different morphologies on the molecular level which give rise to their macro properties .
Long range disorder in the polymer chain is representative of amorphous solids , and the chain segments are considered amorphous .
Long range polymer order is similar to crystalline material , and chain segments are considered crystalline . The thermal characteristics of polymers are fundamentally different from those of most solid materials .
Solid materials typically have one melting point , the T , above which the material loses internal molecular ordering and becomes a liquid .
Polymers have both a melting temperature T and a glass transition temperature T .
Above the T , the polymer chains lose their molecular ordering and exhibit reptation , or mobility .
Below the T , but still above the T , the polymer chains lose some of their long-range mobility and can form either crystalline or amorphous regions .
In this temperature range , as the temperature decreases , amorphous regions can transition into crystalline regions , causing the bulk material to become more crystalline over all .
Below the T , molecular motion is stopped and the polymer chains are essentially frozen in place .
In this temperature range , amorphous regions can no longer transition into crystalline regions , and the polymer as a whole has reached its maximum crystallinity . Hoffman nucleation theory addresses the amorphous to crystalline polymer transition , and this transition can only occur in the temperature range between the T and T .
The transition from an amorphous to a crystalline single polymer chain is related to the random thermal energy required to align and fold sections of the chain to form ordered regions titled lamellae , which are a subset of even bigger structures called spherulites .
The Crystallization of polymers can be brought about by several different methods , and is a complex topic in itself . Nucleation is the formation and growth of a new phase with or without the presence of external surface .
The presence of this surface results in heterogeneous nucleation whereas in its absence homogeneous nucleation occurs .
Heterogeneous nucleation occurs in cases where there are pre-existing nuclei present , such as tiny dust particles suspended in a liquid or gas or reacting with a glass surface containing .
For the process of Hoffman nucleation and its progression to Lauritzen-Hoffman Growth Theory , homogeneous nucleation is the main focus .
Homogeneous nucleation occurs where no such contaminants are present and is less commonly seen .
Homogeneous nucleation begins with small clusters of molecules forming from one phase to the next .
As the clusters grow , they aggregate through the condensation of other molecules .
The size continues to increase and ultimately form macroscopic droplets ( or bubbles depending on the system ) . Nucleation is often described mathematically through the change in Gibbs free energy of n moles of vapor at vapor pressure P that condenses into a drop .
Also the nucleation barrier , in polymer crystallization , consists of both enthalpic and entropic components that must be over come .
This barrier consists of selection processes taking place in different length and time scales which relates to the multiple regimes later on .
This barrier is the free energy required to overcome in order to form nuclei .
It is the formation of the nuclei from the bulk to a surface that is the interfacial free energy .
The interfacial free energy is always a positive term and acts to destabilize the nucleus allowing the continuation of the growing polymer chain .
The nucleation continues as a favorable reaction . The Lauritzen – Hoffman plot ( right ) models the three different regimes when ( logG ) + U * / k ( T-T ) is plotted against ( TΔT ) .
It can be used to describe the rate at which secondary nucleation competes with lateral addition at the growth front among the different temperatures .
This theory can be used to help understand the preferences of nucleation and growth based on the polymer &amp; apos ; s properties including its standard melting temperature . For many polymers , the change between the initial lamellar thickness at T is roughly the same as at T and can thus be modeled by the Gibbs – Thomson equation fairly well .
However , since it implies that the lamellar thickness over the given supercooling range ( T-T ) is unchanged , and many homogeneous nucleation of polymers implies a change of thickness at the growth front , Hoffman and Weeks pursued a more accurate representation .
In this regard , the Hoffman-Weeks plot was created and can be modeled through the equationformula _ 1where β is representative of a thickening factor given by L = L β and Tand T are the crystallization and melting temperatures , respectively . Applying this experimentally for a constant β allows for the determination of the equilibrium melting temperature , T ° at the intersection of Tand T . The crystallization process of polymers does not always obey simple chemical rate equations .
Polymers can crystallize through a variety of different regimes and unlike simple molecules , the polymer crystal lamellae have two very different surfaces .
The two most prominent theories in polymer crystallization kinetics are the Avrami equation and Lauritzen-Hoffman Growth Theory . The Lauritzen-Hoffman growth theory breaks the kinetics of polymer crystallization into ultimately two rates .
The model breaks down into the addition of monomers onto a growing surface .
This initial step is generally associated with the nucleation of the polymer .
From there , the kinetics become the rate which the polymer grows on the surface , or the lateral growth rate , in comparison with the growth rate onto the polymer extending the chain , the secondary nucleation rate .
These two rates can result in three situations . For Regime I , the growth rate on the front laterally , referred to as &amp; quot ; g &amp; quot ; , is the rate-determining step ( RDS ) and exceeds the secondary nucleation rate , &amp; quot ; i &amp; quot ; .
In this instance of &amp; quot ; g &amp; quot ; » &amp; quot ; i &amp; quot ; , monolayers are formed one at a time so that if the substrate has a length of L and thickness , &amp; quot ; b &amp; quot ; , the overall linear growth can be described through the equationformula _ 2and the rate of nucleation in specific can further be described byformula _ 3with K equal toformula _ 4whereThis shows that in Region I , lateral nucleation along the front successfully dominates at temperatures close to the melting temperature , however at more extreme temperatures other forces such as diffusion can impact nucleation rates . In Regime II , the lateral growth rate is either comparable or smaller than the nucleation rate &amp; quot ; g &amp; quot ; ≤ &amp; quot ; i &amp; quot ; , which causes secondary ( or more ) layers to form before the initial layer has been covered .
This allows the linear growth rate to be modeled byformula _ 5Using the assumption that &amp; quot ; g &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; i &amp; quot ; are independent of time , the rate at which new layers are formed can be approximated and the rate of nucleation in regime II can be expressed asformula _ 6with K equal to about 1 / 2 of the K from Regime I , formula _ 7Lastly , Regime III in the L-H model depicts the scenario where lateral growth is inconsequential to the overall rate , since the nucleation of multiple sites causes &amp; quot ; i » g &amp; quot ; .
This means that the growth rate can be modeled by the same equation as Regime I , &amp; lt ; math &amp; gt ; G _ \ text { III } = biL _ \ text { p } = G _ \ text { III } ^ \ circ e ^

In Vain ( band ) In Vain is a progressive death metal band from Kristiansand in Norway .
Their music can be described as melodic extreme metal , and it is mainly composed by their guitarist Johnar Håland .
The band has released four albums , and toured Europe with Solefald in 2013 and My Silent Wake in 2010 .
In Vain has also played concerts in Norway , and also played at the Inferno Metal Festival in 2013 . The band was formed by guitarist Johnar Haaland and vocalist Andreas Frigstad in 2003 .
They were shortly joined by keyboardist and vocalist Sindre Nedland .
In 2004 they recorded their first release , a three track EP &amp; quot ; Will the Sun Ever Rise ? &amp; quot ; .
The EP featured guest Joakim Sehl on bass guitar , while the drums were sampled .
The following year , 2005 , they released another EP named &amp; quot ; Wounds &amp; quot ; .
This EP featured several guests , two of them being bassist / vocalist , Kristian Wikstøl , lending both his bass and vocal skills to this release and drummer Anders Haave .
Anders joined the band shortly after the release , but was soon replaced by Stig Reinhardtsen .
Their music had then moved in a more diverse and progressive direction . In late 2005 the band were then joined by bassist Ole Vistnes and guitarist Magnus Olav Tveiten , and began to write and record their first full-length album .
The album &amp; quot ; The Latter Rain &amp; quot ; was recorded in DUB studio in 2006 .
Close to 20 guest musicians participated in the recordings , amongst them Jan K .
Transeth , Kjetil Nordhus and future bassist / vocalist Kristian Wikstøl on hardcore vocals .
Guitarist Even Fuglestad replaced guitarist Magnus Olav Tveiten during the recordings , but were unable to participate on the record .
Magnus still contributed on the record .
&amp; quot ; The Latter Rain &amp; quot ; was released in 2007 .
Just before the band began playing live gigs they were joined by bassist / vocalist Kristian Wikstøl who replaced former bassist Ole Vistnes .
They played live with Battered and Vreid on the Northern Brigade Tour in March – April 2007 . In the summer of 2008 the band started to record their second full-length album &amp; quot ; Mantra &amp; quot ; .
Guitarist Even Fuglestad left the band on good terms before the recordings of the album .
He still contributed some additional guitars for the album .
Future replacement-guitarist , Kjetil D .
Pedersen , contributed some lead guitars on this album .
He joined the band before the tour for the album .
It was released on January 18 , 2010 .
This album saw a more diverse genre than the previous album , with two tracks being more in the vein of blues than metal .
Sindre Nedland also utilized more deep growls together with his clean vocals giving more diversity to the music .
The blues influence was almost entirely discarded on the next record .
In 2012 several members of the band joined the live line-up of the band Solefald .
Later that year the band got together to write and record their third full-length album . Ænigma was recorded in 2012 and released on March 11 , 2013 .
The tour for support of Ænigma included three session musicians .
The bassist , Kristian , decided to study abroad for two years , taking a break from In Vain , but with the intention to return afterwards .
The replacement was Alexander Lebowski Bøe from Solefald .
It remains to be seen who will record on the upcoming album .
The drummer , Stig , was working in Korea and his replacement was Baard Kolstad from Borknagar , ICS Vortex , Ihsahn and Solefald .
The guitarist Kjetil were shortly unavailable due to family commitments , and his replacement were Petter Hallaråker from ICS Vortex and Rendezvous Point . Currents was recorded in 2017 and will be released on January 26 , 2018 .
Two editions will be released : The normal edition , with 7 tracks and a running time of around 43 minutes , and the special edition with 9 tracks and a running time of just over an hour .
In an announcement on Facebook , In Vain have said &amp; quot ; The album title , Currents , reflects on the colossal shifts and changes of our time .
The present world is characterized by continental flows of people , traditions and cultures .
Migration of people across continents and borders .
Cultures merging .
Dramatic shifts in lifestyle from one generation to the next .
These are all currents - movements that distort old patterns , create tensions as well as new opportunities .
These enduring shifts are some of the topics that In Vain addresses on Currents through a series of epic and monumental songs . &amp; quot ;
Shoppach HouseThe Shoppach House is a historic house at 508 North Main Street in Benton , Arkansas .
Its front section is a brick structure , 1-1 / 2 stories in height , from which a single-story wood frame ell extends to the rear .
The house was built in 1852 by John Shoppach , and was the first brick house in Saline County .
Shoppach &amp; apos ; s original plan called for the brick section to be organized similar to a typical dogtrot , with a central breezeway flanked by two rooms .
The house was occupied by five generations of the Shoppach family . The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 .
Johnston LibraryThe Johnston Library is a historic library located at 210 W .
10th St .
in Baxter Springs , Kansas .
The building was constructed in 1872 to serve as a courthouse during Baxter Springs &amp; apos ; unsuccessful attempt to become the Cherokee County seat .
Though Baxter Springs had lost an election to choose the county seat in 1869 to Columbus , supporters of both cities had attempted to fraudulently swing the election in their favor , and Baxter Springs hoped it could still become county seat in the future .
The building initially served as the county jail and sheriff &amp; apos ; s office until Columbus completed its jail in 1880 .
After this , Baxter Springs ultimately gave up its attempts to become the county seat , and the building became its city hall .
In 1905 , resident Niles P .
Johnston bequeathed $ 5,000 to the city to start a library , and the city hall building was chosen to house it . The two-story brick building &amp; apos ; s design is a mixture of the Classical Revival and Richardsonian Romanesque styles .
Key features of both styles appear in the library &amp; apos ; s main entrance ; its pediment and pilasters are typical Classical Revival elements , while the Syrian arch doorway is a Richardsonian Romanesque feature .
The library also includes a gable roof and a cornice with ornamental corbels and brackets . The library was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 21 , 1976 .
2013 FEU Tamaraws men &amp; apos ; s basketball teamThe 2013 FEU Tamaraws men &amp; apos ; s basketball team represented Far Eastern University during the 76th season of the UAAP men &amp; apos ; s basketball tournament that began on June 29 , 2013 .
The Tamaraws finished the eliminations with a 10-4 record and placed third in the tournament after losing to DLSU in the semifinals . The Tamaraws played the season opener facing the Battle of the East rival and the much favored preseason Filoil champions UE Red Warriors .
The Tams found themselves trailing 21-11 at the end of the first quarter .
The Warriors were mostly leading by double digits the entire first half until the Tams were able to claw their way back to cut the lead down to a single digit in the final 2 minute frame of the second quarter , 32-37 .
FEU started the second half on a 10-3 run to take advantage of the Warriors 42-40 in the first three minutes of the third quarter , only to end the momentum with Garcia committing an unsportsmanlike foul that gave the Warriors their own 7-0 surge to regain the lead 42-47 .
FEU scored the last six points to lead the Warriors 61-54 to end the third .
FEU led as much as 15 in the fourth and went on to win the game , 89-78 , their seventh straight win against the Warriors . Leading by as much as 11 points in the fourth quarter , the Eagles came back with a 14-2 run to gain the lead , 58-57 .
FEU then scored three straight baskets for a 59-64 lead with over two minutes in the fourth but Elorde made a quick three to pull within two , 62-64 .
The game were tied at 66 with 10 seconds left in the game and eventually went to overtime after a Garcia miss .
The Tams outscored the Eagles , 13-9 in overtime to get the win , 79-75 , ending their six-game losing streak to the Eagles .
Romeo scored six of the Tams &amp; apos ; last eight points in the extra period . Terrence Romeo was named the first Press Corps Player of the Week of the season averaging 21 points , 5 . 3 assists and two steals per game in wins over UE , Ateneo and UP . Though FEU led almost the entire game with as much as 17 , Sumang-led Red Warriors came back late in the fourth quarter taking advantage of FEU &amp; apos ; s lackluster defense and poor free throw shooting to tie the game at 70 .
The game went to overtime and the Warriors were in control in the extra period with a seven-point lead with 28 seconds in left , but was not able to cap off the win as they let the Tams score five straight points with Romeo completing a coast to coast finish and Mendoza stealing an inbound pass off of UE &amp; apos ; s Santos for a three-point marker putting the Tams within striking distance , 84-82 .
Sumang was fouled and missed one of his free throws with 13 seconds left , giving FEU the chance to tie the game only being down by three , 85-82 .
Tolomia hit the three pointer after faking a hand-off pass to Romeo and sends the game to its second overtime .
The Tams showed dominance into the second overtime with a 98-94 win , snapping their two-game losing skid .
The Warriors lost eight straight games to the Tamaraws .

Stop Court-Packing ActStop Court-Packing Act ( &amp; quot ; H . R .
2239 &amp; quot ; ) was a proposed bill ( law ) that was introduced in the 113th United States Congress on June 4 , 2013 , with the full title of the bill stating to &amp; quot ; reduce the number of Federal judgeships for the U . S .
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit &amp; quot ; .
The chief sponsor of the legislation was Republican Tom Cotton ( R-AR4 ) , with no other notable co-sponsors .
He proposed a bill that would reduce the number of judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from eleven to eight . President Barack Obama said in a high-profile press conference , held in the White House ’ s Rose Garden that he will nominate Cornelia &amp; quot ; Nina &amp; quot ; Pillard , Patricia Millett and Robert L .
Wilkins to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit .
However , Cotton introduced the Stop Court-Packing Act to eliminate three &amp; quot ; needless &amp; quot ; judgeships from the D . C .
Circuit , claiming it would save millions of dollars . In his reaction to the proposed Act , President Obama said it was an &amp; quot ; obviously blatant political move &amp; quot ; on the part of Senate Republicans to seek to reduce the size of the court while he was President .
He noted that two months prior a judicial conference led by Justice Roberts said the current workload of the D . C .
Circuit required 11 judges . Janine Parry , a professor of politics at the University of Arkansas , said it would make some sense to read Cotton ’ s actions as a signal of his intent to challenge U . S .
Sen .
Mark Pryor , D-Ark . , in the 2014 mid-term elections , as well as a way to burnish his image among conservative Republicans . In early 2013 , Senator Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) proposed a similar bill that would reduce the number of judges on the D . C .
Circuit by three and would add one judge each to the New York-based Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the Atlanta-based Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals .
The Judicial Conference , however , has not recommended that any additional judges be added to those two Circuit Courts of Appeals .
St German &amp; apos ; s ChurchSt German &amp; apos ; s Church ( dedicated to St Germanus of Auxerre , the &amp; quot ; Garmon Sant &amp; quot ; of Welsh tradition ) is a nineteenth-century Church in Wales parish church in Adamsdown , Cardiff , Wales .
The building , located on the corner of Star Street and Metal Street , is a Grade I Listed building . The first church in this locality was established in 1857 in a converted barn and was known as &amp; quot ; Splott Chapel &amp; quot ; and as &amp; quot ; Christ Church &amp; quot ; .
In 1874 this was replaced by a second-hand building made of iron .
The population was growing rapidly and this building soon became inadequate .
By 1881 the parish had raised £ 5000 to build a new church .
Lord Tredegar donated the land and laid the foundation stone of the new church in April 1882 . The new church was designed by architect George Frederick Bodley , part of architectural partnership Bodley &amp; amp ; Garner .
It was built between 1881 and 1884 .
Newman describes the church as &amp; quot ; tall , spacious and elegant &amp; quot ; and of &amp; quot ; widespread influence locally &amp; quot ; .
Among other features of note , high on the south wall of the chancel of St .
German &amp; apos ; s is a particularly finely carved and painted organ case – recently painstakingly restored to its former glory – which was given to the new church by the Rev .
Francis Edward Nugee , who spent most of the 1880s as a young curate in the parish of Roath under the Rev .
Charles Smythies , who was vicar of Roath until 1883 ; Smythies went on to become Bishop of British Central Africa ( later renamed Nyasaland , now Malawi ) and Nugee later married his half-sister , Edith Alston .
In addition to the church there is a school and clergy house next door , built contemporaneously by the same architects .
St German &amp; apos ; s church was consecrated in March 1886 and the new parish of St German was created in the same month . The BBC Radio 4 programme &amp; quot ; The Daily Service &amp; quot ; has been broadcast from St German &amp; apos ; s on several occasions .
Ip Man ( TV series ) Ip Man is a 2013 Chinese television series romanticising the life of Ip Man ( Mandarin : Ye Wen ) , a Chinese martial artist specialising in Wing Chun .
Directed by Fan Xiaotian , the series starred Hong Kong actor Kevin Cheng as the title character , with Han Xue , Liu Xiaofeng , Chrissie Chau , Song Yang , Yu Rongguang , Yuen Wah and Bruce Leung as part of the supporting cast .
Wilson Yip , the director of the films &amp; quot ; Ip Man &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Ip Man 2 &amp; quot ; ( starring Donnie Yen ) , and Taiwanese producer Young Pei-pei served as the artistic consultants for the series , while Ip Man &amp; apos ; s sons , Ip Chun and Ip Ching , served as the martial arts consultants .
The series was shot from July – November 2012 in Kunshan , Suzhou , and was first aired on Shandong TV from 24 February to 9 March 2013 .
It won the Golden Eagle Award for Best Television Series in 2012 . There was fierce competition among many companies over the rights to the production of a television series about Ip Man since Wilson Yip &amp; apos ; s movies &amp; quot ; Ip Man &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Ip Man 2 &amp; quot ; ( starring Donnie Yen ) came into the limelight .
Around June 2012 , Suzhou Funa Films and Television acquired the rights to produce the television series .
Fan Xiaotian , who previously directed many Chinese television series , was selected as the director , while Hong Kong screenwriter Charcoal Tan was chosen to write the script .
Wilson Yip and Taiwanese producer Young Pei-pei served as artistic consultants while Ip Man &amp; apos ; s sons , Ip Chun and Ip Ching , were invited to be martial arts consultants for the series . Shooting for &amp; quot ; Ip Man &amp; quot ; began in July 2012 and finalised in around November . After the release of &amp; quot ; Ip Man &amp; quot ; , BBC UKChina conducted a telephone interview with Fan Xiaotian about the television series .
Fan mentioned that the earlier &amp; quot ; Ip Man &amp; quot ; films were too short , and that his purpose in creating the television series was to present a more developed and lively story about Ip Man which allows audiences to explore the character in greater depth .
He also felt it was a very opportune time to produce a television series about Ip Man because Wilson Yip &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Ip Man &amp; quot ; movies were very successful and influential , and also because Wong Kar-wai was making &amp; quot ; The Grandmaster &amp; quot ; when &amp; quot ; Ip Man &amp; quot ; ( TV series ) was in production . Fan Xiaotian and Young Pei-pei were keen on recruiting actor Vincent Zhao , who has a background in martial arts , to play the lead character .
Taking some netizens &amp; apos ; opinions and suggestions into account , the production team also considered casting Han Geng , Wu Chun , Wallace Chung and Wallace Huo in the series .
However , the role of Ip Man eventually went to Hong Kong TVB artiste Kevin Cheng , who previously appeared as a young Ip Man in the 2013 film &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( starring Anthony Wong ) .
Han Xue was chosen to portray Ip Man &amp; apos ; s wife Cheung Wing-sing ( Mandarin : Zhang Yongcheng ) .
Other cast members include Liu Xiaofeng , Chrissie Chau , Yu Rongguang , Yuen Wah , Bruce Leung , Song Yang and Kou Zhenhai . In September 2012 , the cast and crew of &amp; quot ; Ip Man &amp; quot ; appeared at a publicity event in Suzhou to promote the television series .
Sirius buildingThe Sirius building is an apartment complex in The Rocks district of Sydney , New South Wales , Australia .
Designed for the Housing Commission of New South Wales in 1978 – 1979 by commission architect Tao Gofers , the building is a prominent example of Brutalist architecture in Australia and has striking repetitive geometries in reaction to the Japanese metabolist architecture movement .
Notable for being the only high rise development in The Rocks , &amp; quot ; Sirius &amp; quot ; houses 79 apartments with one , two , three or four bedrooms , generally with single storey apartments to two and three storey walk ups .
The complex was built to rehouse public tenants who had been displaced after a controversial redevelopment of the historic Rocks suburb during the 1960s and 70s , housing many of the original residents who fought for their right to remain in the area during the famous Green bans .
Since 2015 , the Sirius Building has been at the centre of controversy over plans to remove the residents , sell off the building and possibly redevelop the site , with opponents of the plans seeking to secure its protection as a heritage building .
Following the NSW Government &amp; apos ; s decision to refuse heritage listing in 2017 , against the advice of the Heritage Council of New South Wales , the building was put up for sale . The complex was built to rehouse public tenants who had been displaced after a controversial redevelopment of the historic Rocks suburb during the 1960s and 70s .
The building housed many of the original residents who fought for their right to remain in the area during the famous Green bans , whose purpose was not to retain heritage buildings but rather to retain the working class community in The Rocks .
Many of the buildings remain , but the majority of the residents were moved into the Sirius apartments in the so-called &amp; apos ; people &amp; apos ; s plan &amp; apos ; .
The terraces and town houses they used to call home are owned by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority ( SHFA ) , who receive rent from the tenants living in the building . &amp; quot ; Sirius &amp; quot ; is among the few quality examples of the Brutalism style in Australia , demonstrating the style &amp; apos ; s objective of ethical design based on social concerns as well as its focus on the truthful expression of materials , function and structure .
Designed by Housing Commission archtitect , Tao Gofers , Sirius was based on Gofer &amp; apos ; s other major project for the Housing Commission : &amp; quot ; The Laurels &amp; quot ; , a public housing development in southern Sydney &amp; apos ; s Sans Souci .
Like that development , Gofer &amp; apos ; s original plan was to finish the building in a white colour to match the nearby Sydney Opera House , but due to budget constraints , the building was finished unpainted .
Anecdotally , unit 74 of the Sirius building became somewhat of an unofficial Sydney landmark ; its sign displaying ‘ One Way ! Jesus ’ clearly visible to Harbour Bridge commuters .
The sign was in place for around 10 years , although the owner of the sign , Owen McAloon , and his motivations to spread a Christian message remained generally unknown . The Deutsches Architekturmuseum ( DAM ) in Frankfurt has included the Sirius building in # SOSBrutalism , a growing database that currently contains over 700 Brutalist buildings .
Importantly , # SOSBrutalism is a platform for a large campaign ‘ to save our beloved concrete monsters ’ .
The buildings in the database marked red are in particular jeopardy .
There are few Australian entries in the project , but Sirius is at the top of the list of the world &amp; apos ; s endangered Brutalist buildings .
A decision to sell the building was made in 2015 by the Baird Coalition government , thereby placing it under risk of demolition due to a lack of any heritage protection .
The NSW Heritage Council recommended heritage listing for the building in 2016 , but this was denied by the Heritage Minister , Mark Speakman .
The Land and Environment Court of New South Wales was advised in a hearing that redevelopment would affect views of the Sydney Opera House , a World Heritage Site , as well as &amp; quot ; impinge on the Rocks &amp; apos ; low-rise heritage , wharves , sandstone buildings and Victorian terraces &amp; quot ; . In July 2016 Speakman announced that the building would not be heritage listed &amp; quot ; despite a unanimous recommendation by the Heritage Council &amp; quot ; , citing the loss of financial return as a consequence of listing as the reason .
The Sirius building is included on the World Monuments Fund &amp; apos ; s 2018 list of monuments at risk , with the listing calling &amp; quot ; on the government of New South Wales to respect the recommendation of its heritage experts and allow its citizens to maintain an important social legacy &amp; quot ; . In July 2017 , the Land and Environment Court ruled the decision by the state ’ s then-heritage minister Mark Speakman not to place the Sirius public housing complex on the State Heritage Register was “ invalid and of no legal effect . ” The court determined the government ’ s claim of financial loss did not constitute “ financial hardship ” and that the minister failed to consider the building ’ s heritage significance in his decision .
The court ordered the Minister for Heritage ( Gabrielle Upton at the time of the ruling ) “ to make a decision either to direct or not to direct the listing of the Sirius Apartment Building &amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; according to the law &amp; quot ; .
In October 2017 , Upton again refused to list Sirius on the state heritage register , noting &amp; quot ; In my view , &amp; # 91 ; Sirius &amp; # 93 ; is not a landmark worthy of State heritage protection . &amp; quot ; The last remaining resident was Myra Demetriou , who in 2017 was 90 and legally blind .
Efforts to move the last residents were made to accommodation described as &amp; quot ; unsuitable &amp; quot ; .
Demetriou moved out as the last resident on 1 February 2018 . The S . O . S .
( Save Our Sirius Foundation ) was formed by people and organisations campaigning to save Sirius and its residents and is supported by the National Trust of Australia , the Australian Institute of Architects , the Millers Point Residents Action Group , Friends of Millers Point , Millers Point Public Housing Tenants Group , Unions NSW , CFMEU , and Jack Mundey , the Green Ban campaigner who helped save The Rocks from redevelopment in the 1970s .
The NSW chapter president of the Australian Institute of Architects , Shaun Carter , is chairman of the Save Our Sirius Foundation .
Carter has argued that any decision about the building should take account of its social , cultural and environmental significance . A set of &amp; quot ; S . O . S . &amp; quot ; lights flashed over The Rocks and Circular Quay from the top floor of Sirius when they were first installed to coincide with the exhibition S . O . S .
Save our Sirius on 2 November 2014 .
Resident McAloon &amp; apos ; s sign was briefly replaced by lights flashing S . O . S .
to the Harbour Bridge traffic , but this was soon &amp; apos ; confiscated &amp; apos ; by Housing NSW and McAloon &amp; apos ; relocated &amp; apos ; by Housing NSW .
Other supporters of the building include Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore , state member for Sydney , Alex Greenwich , and the Australian Labor Party .
Anthony Albanese described the Sirius building as &amp; quot ; not just a place people call home , but a symbol of inclusion &amp; quot ; , while the local member for Sydney , Tanya Plibersek called the government &amp; apos ; s decision to sell &amp; quot ; heartless &amp; quot ; .
The S . O . S Foundation suggested that &amp; quot ; Sirius &amp; quot ; could be saved if the Lendlease Residential Development Company purchased the building and developed some of its apartments for social and affordable housing .
When Lendlease announced they would not be making a bid for the building , the foundation announced its intention to assemble a bid .
Various public protests supported the inclusion of the building on the State heritage Register , including a petition , a crowd funded legal challenge , whose organisers aim to have the Minister &amp; apos ; s decision annulled ; a rally ; and a green ban announced by the Construction Forestry Mining &amp; amp ; Energy Union ( CFMEU ) , under which no company associated with union will be involved with any proposed demolition of the building .
The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim – HearthfireThe Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim – Hearthfire is the second downloadable content add-on for the action role-playing open world video game &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
The game was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks .
The Xbox 360 version of &amp; quot ; Hearthfire &amp; quot ; launched on September 4 , 2012 .
It was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam on October 5 , 2012 .
It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 19 , 2013 , in North America and February 20 , 2013 , in Europe . &amp; quot ; Hearthfire &amp; quot ; revolves around acquiring and improving land , allowing the player to build and customize their own home .
The add-on also introduced adoption , giving players the option of adopting up to two children to live with them in their personal home . &amp; quot ; Hearthfire &amp; quot ; allows the player character to purchase a plot of land and build their own home from raw materials such as lumber and clay , with the option of adding features such as greenhouses , bee hives , and alchemy and enchanting facilities .
There are three homesteads the player can build : Lakeview Manor ( east of Falkreath ) , Windstad Manor ( northeast of Morthal ) , and Heljarchen Hall ( south of Dawnstar ) .
There are options to hire stewards to look after the home , carriage drivers for quick transportation , and a personal bard .
&amp; quot ; Hearthfire &amp; quot ; also introduces the option to raise a family by adopting children .
In addition , previously bought pre-built homes , such as Proudspire Manor in Solitude , can be altered to have a children &amp; apos ; s bedroom added into them . &amp; quot ; Hearthfire &amp; quot ; was released on September 4 , 2012 for Xbox 360 , and October 4 , 2012 on PC .
Due to performance issues , the PlayStation 3 version of &amp; quot ; Hearthfire &amp; quot ; was delayed and later released on February 19 , 2013 . &amp; quot ; Hearthfire &amp; quot ; received a mixed reception , with Metacritic ranking the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game with scores of 69 and 54 , respectively .
Eurogamer gave &amp; quot ; Hearthfire &amp; quot ; a score of 5 / 10 , stating that it could have been &amp; quot ; more creative &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; less restrictive &amp; quot ; in its house building feature , and that the new child adoption seemed nothing more than &amp; quot ; simply picking one of a handful of pre-rendered moppets who will go through a series of pre-rendered routines &amp; quot ; .
However , the site went on to say that its content was worth the low price point , and was a &amp; quot ; more interesting way of incorporating useful features into the world than simply having you unlock a pre-built house &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; PlayStation Official Magazine &amp; quot ; gave a positive review , calling the DLC &amp; quot ; reasonably priced &amp; quot ; , stating , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Skyrim &amp; quot ; is a game you really make your own , and building a home in &amp; quot ; Hearthfire &amp; quot ; is a natural and enjoyable extension of this concept .
It &amp; apos ; s not quite up there with the excitement of slaying beasts and looting dungeons , but homebodies will love it nonetheless . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; The Escapist &amp; quot ; gave the add-on 3 out of 5 stars , and felt that the new adoption feature was &amp; quot ; kind of a waste of time &amp; quot ; due to the absence of the child developing or growing older .
In regards to the home building , the magazine criticized the lack of customization options and wrote , &amp; quot ; you can &amp; apos ; t even choose which furniture goes into each room , just whether or not it &amp; apos ; s made . &amp; quot ; The magazine did note that &amp; quot ; Hearthfire &amp; quot ; provides an added convenience to the player for managing their items , along with the benefit of cutting down on traveling time to a forge or enchanter &amp; apos ; s table .
VideoGamer . com panned the add-on , specifically its shortcomings in offering the player their personal touch .
The site wrote that the &amp; quot ; variety and customization &amp; quot ; options of the homes were lacking , and as a result &amp; quot ; never feels like it &amp; apos ; s truly yours &amp; quot ; .

The OAC comprises at least three divisions : the National Center for Digital Services , the National Center for Data Peering , and SOOO Belarusian Cloud Technologies ( beCloud ) . Among other things the OAC operation involves preventing DOS / DDOS attacks against websites , offering a cloud computing service in Belarus to enable information interoperability between government agencies and the operation of the digital government , nominating primary national ISPs , which can connect to foreign networks , verifying the suitability of equipment required for digital interactive games . On 18 December 1973 , the USSR State Technical Commission was set up to organize and carry out work to protect information by engineering and technical methods in the defense industry . The Commission was headquartered in Moscow , with regional branches reporting to the central agency .
Each regional branch was assigned an area of responsibility including defense enterprises and organizations located in several oblasts or republics . In July 1979 , the Minsk Regional Inspection for Complex Technical Control was founded .
The Minsk Special Center of the USSR State Technical Commission was set up on the premises of the regional inspection in August 1989 . During the establishment of statehood in Belarus the country ’ s leadership took measures to secure information protection in all spheres of activities of the state for the sake of ensuring the national security . On 12 January 1993 , by the resolution of the government the Minsk Special Center of the USSR State Technical Commission was reorganized into the State Center for Information Security under the Defense Ministry of the Republic of Belarus . The new body was tasked with ensuring the protection of classified data by technical means in government agencies , at enterprises , in institutions and organizations during the research , development , manufacturing , and operation of armaments , military hardware , automated control systems , electronic computing machines used for the defense and security of the country . In October 1994 , by the relevant decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus control over the State Center for Information Security was transferred to the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus . In November 2000 , the State Center for Information Security under the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus was converted into the State Center for Information Security under the President of the Republic of Belarus . On 21 April 2008 , in line with the relevant presidential decree the State Center for Information Security was converted into the Operations and Analysis Center under the President of the Republic of Belarus ( OAC ) .

Oxyrrhis marinaOxyrrhis marina is a species of dinoflagellates with flagella .
A marine heterotroph , it is found in much of the world . This protozoan species has an asymmetrical oval shape to its single-celled body .
It has been likened to a rugby ball .
The cell usually measures between 20 and 30 micrometers , but it is known to reach 60 .
It has two flagella with a protruding , tentacle-like bulge between them .
The flagella are covered in scales .
Most individuals have scales on the body surface , as well .
The two flagella have separate functions .
One undulates in waves and the other is coiled , producing a corkscrew-like propulsion to move the cell .
The individual appears colorless , but a concentrated culture of cells may have a pink tinge . The species is thought to have a global distribution except for the polar seas , where it is likely absent or rare , though few samples have been taken of these waters .
There are specific records from waters near Europe , North America , Asia , New Zealand , the Canary Islands , Hawaii , and the Azores .
It has been found in isolated inland waters , as well , such as a lake in Ukraine .
It is less common in the open waters of the oceans .
There is a question as to how it came to inhabit so many islands if it is apparently rare in the open ocean .
It may have been slowly dispersed on the currents , carried in mats of algae , or transported by humans when shipping arose . It is most common in the intertidal zone and other coastal regions , where it is a member of the plankton .
Habitat types include tide pools and estuaries .
It was first described from a salt marsh .
It tolerates wide ranges in salinity , temperature , and pH . It is heterotrophic , obtaining nutrients externally instead of synthesizing them by an internal process such as photosynthesis .
It is an omnivorous grazer , consuming various types of tiny organisms from its environment .
It eats phytoplankton such as minute algaes .
It has been observed eating &amp; quot ; Nannochloris oculata &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Micromonas pusilla &amp; quot ; , other flagellates such as &amp; quot ; Goniomonas amphinema &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Pfiesteria piscicida &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; Stoeckeria algicida &amp; quot ; , and some bacteria .
It often eats the coccolithophore &amp; quot ; Cricosphaera elongata &amp; quot ; , and , in experimental situations , readily eats &amp; quot ; Tetraselmis suecica &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Isochrysis galbana &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; Rhodomonas &amp; quot ; sp .
Some of these food items are relatively large , as large as the &amp; quot ; O .
marina &amp; quot ; cell itself .
It is selective in its grazing , showing clear preferences for certain food taxa .
It can also pick certain individuals over others , as evidenced by its preference for virus-infected &amp; quot ; Emiliana huxleyi &amp; quot ; cells over healthy cells .
It is cannibalistic , as well .
It feeds by phagocytosis , totally engulfing its prey .
It has been observed spinning one of its flagella in such a way that it creates a current , pulling the item closer so it can seize it .
It is also raptorial , approaching and pouncing on the prey item , especially when the item is a protist .
&amp; quot ; O .
marina &amp; quot ; can sense and respond to certain chemicals that are exuded by algal prey . The locomotion of the &amp; quot ; O .
marina &amp; quot ; cell is helical due to the simultaneous movement of its two flagella .
It mostly swims in a straight line , but it makes turns when it detects food . In terms of reproduction , &amp; quot ; O .
marina &amp; quot ; is isogamous , with reproductive cells smaller than the body cell , but very little is known about these . This species sometimes forms red tides , but will also feed on the raphidophyte , &amp; quot ; Heterosigma akashiwo &amp; quot ; , another organism responsible for red tides .
Its blooms when forming red tides are likely stimulated by environmental factors , such as drops in salinity or increases in prey abundance .
&amp; quot ; O .
marina &amp; quot ; may also affect the environment by producing dimethyl sulfide , which is released when it grazes on some prey types , such as &amp; quot ; E .
huxleyi &amp; quot ; . Predators of &amp; quot ; O .
marina &amp; quot ; include protozoa such as the ciliate &amp; quot ; Strombidinopsis jeokjo &amp; quot ; , copepods such as &amp; quot ; Acartia tonsa &amp; quot ; and rotifers .
The mixotrophic flagellate &amp; quot ; Prymnesium parvum &amp; quot ; is a prey item for &amp; quot ; O .
marina &amp; quot ; when the former is nutrient-replete , but can become a predator when it is nutrient-stressed It has been used as food for fish larvae , including those of black porgy ( &amp; quot ; Mylio macrocephalus &amp; quot ; ) , lemonpeel angelfish ( &amp; quot ; Centropyge flavissima &amp; quot ; ) , and grey mullet ( &amp; quot ; Mugil cephalus &amp; quot ; ) .
Bryozoans have been grown on a mixture of the protist and yeast . This protist has been studied extensively .
It is a model organism for the study of many aspects of protist biology , including feeding behavior , physiology , ecology , growth , trophic position , evolution , genomics , and biogeography .
Many more studies of its genetics are now underway .
There are some limitations to using the species as a model , in part because dinoflagellates are so diverse .
&amp; quot ; O .
marina &amp; quot ; itself is very diverse , with many varied strains , and their biology is influenced by the environment , so it can be hard to find a representative specimen to use as a model .
In fact , some experts deny that it is a dinoflagellate at all , or at least a &amp; quot ; true &amp; quot ; dinoflagellate .
In general , it is still very useful for scientific experiments , and researchers recommend it . &amp; quot ; O .
marina &amp; quot ; has genes that have evidently been transferred to it from bacteria .
It also has some genes that are related to plastids , indicating that it may have had an ancestor that could perform photosynthesis .
Also , it has some genes related to essential amino acid synthesis , something that is uncommon in heterotrophs , as they usually obtain essential amino acids by eating them . It is easy to isolate from the environment and easy to grow in the laboratory .
Cultures are fed &amp; quot ; Dunaliella primolecta &amp; quot ; or any of a number of other readily available protists .
Dead &amp; quot ; E .
coli &amp; quot ; cells can also be used for food .
It can also be sustained on a nutritional medium .
Cultures can be maintained for years . This protist has been called a morphospecies .
As it is now understood , it is composed of a number of isolates , some of which are quite distinct .
There are 50 to 80 wild isolates .
In the future some of these could be divided into separate taxa , perhaps on the species level .
One of these may become &amp; quot ; Oxyrrhis maritima &amp; quot ; .
Another called &amp; quot ; O .
tenticulifera &amp; quot ; may be valid , as well .

Cheyenne Mountain Country ClubThe Cheyenne Mountain Country Club is located in Colorado Springs , Colorado at the mouth of Cheyenne Canyon . The Cheyenne Mountain Country Club Association was founded on February 19 , 1891 .
The founders were successful men or came from wealthy families , many of whom came to Colorado for the climate and high altitude as a means to improve their health . Two years prior , in April 1889 , a country club was created that offered members facilities for polo , golf , cricket , equestrian riding , shooting , horse racing , shooting and bowling facilities .
William A .
Otis sold the club a casino and property for the country club in 1891 .
The club then became the Cheyenne Mountain Country Club . William H .
Sanford was the Cheyenne Mountain Country Club &amp; apos ; s first president and was head of the Polo Committee .
Foxhall P .
Keene joined the team as a non-resident player in 1896 .
President Theodore Roosevelt , Harry Payne Whitney and John Percival &amp; quot ; Percy &amp; quot ; Hagerman played on the club &amp; apos ; s polo fields . Members — who came from England , Europe , and the east coast of the United States — were called &amp; quot ; Grizzlies &amp; quot ; .
They were generally socialites and businessmen in mining or other industries .
By the 1890s , a trolley system was inaugurated to run from downtown Colorado Springs to the Broadmoor Casino and the Cheyenne Mountain Country Club .
In 1893 , Spencer Penrose was made a member . Chester Alan Arthur II was president of Cheyenne Mountain Country Club between 1905 and 1908 .
He also provided funding for facilities at the club .
Richard Bolles was the country club &amp; apos ; s president for 6 years . At one time the club used live birds for shooting events and docked polo ponies tails ; To address concerns about humane treatment the club switched to clay pigeons for shooting and discontinued docking ponies tails . The club won the Rocky Mountain Polo Championship and the Interstate Polo Club trophy in 1906 and 1907 . Spencer Penrose built the &amp; quot ; premier golfing resort &amp; quot ; , The Broadmoor near the country club .
To further attract patrons to the hotel , Penrose developed a polo team .
As a result of The Broadmoor resort &amp; apos ; s success , the country club has not had the notoriety of its early years . Polo is no longer played at the country club .
As an homage to the club &amp; apos ; s polo-playing history , there is an exhibit with the Foxhall Keene Cup .

The history of the case was recorded in the &amp; quot ; Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal &amp; quot ; for 1843 .
To the Royal Medical Society he made a contribution on &amp; quot ; Diphtheria &amp; quot ; , mainly based on observations of the disease at Raughton Head .

Ed SilvosoEd Silvoso ( born June 15 , 1945 ) is an author , documentarian , and founder of both Harvest Evangelism and the International Transformation Network , the objective of which is to end worldwide systemic poverty .
Dr .
Silvoso is a recognized leader of the Argentine Revival and of the modern transformation movement .
He addresses massive audiences in several nations and offers solutions to problems facing the twenty-first century . Ed Silvoso was born June 15 , 1945 , at San Nicolás de los Arroyos , Argentina .
He is the son of Omar Edmundo Silvoso and Maria Teresa Troia and has a younger sister , Maria Rosa .
They formed an evangelistic team at the age of seventeen when the country was intensely anti-evangelical .
He graduated from Colegio Nacional Justo Jose de Urquiza in 1962 ; seven years later he left success in the marketplace to become a pastor in Mar del Plata , Argentina .
Dr .
Silvoso married Ruth Noemi Palau , sister of renowned Christian evangelist Luis Palau , on April 20 , 1968 , and within a decade they had four daughters . He studied at Multnomah Bible College while organizing large religious events in major South American locations ; he then moved to Pasadena , California , to attend Fuller Seminary .
Ed Silvoso began working full-time with Luis Palau &amp; apos ; s evangelistic team in 1970 and became the coordinator for International Mass Media Evangelism .
He served as pastor for various congregations , as a missionary with Overseas Crusades ( 1970 – 1976 ) , and as a team member with Palau ( 1977 – 1980 ) .
He launched his own ministry in 1980 and since then has written five bestselling books . Ed Silvoso began as a lay evangelist and national youth leader in Argentina ( 1958 – 1969 ) , and over the past thirty years he has become a principal figure in the transformation movement .
His definition of systemic poverty has elevated the issue from theory and dialogue to implementation and relief .
He founded Harvest Evangelism in San Jose , California , and today it has over eighty associates around the world .
Dr .
Silvoso hosts international conferences that promote city , regional , and national change through ecumenical ministry . In 2002 , he established the International Transformation Network , a voluntary association that creates alliances between clergy and local marketplaces , and toward that end he travels throughout the year encouraging cooperation between various religious groups .
Dr .
Silvoso mentors church leaders , as well as heads of government and industry , how to apply the principles of transformation outlined in his books .
He has addressed huge audiences in the United States and around the world in arenas and stadiums and at multimedia events . Harvest Evangelism was founded in August 1980 and pioneered city transformation beginning with Resistencia .
Ed and Ruth converted their weekend home at San Nicolás de los Arroyos into a prayer chapel and retreat center ; the purpose was to launch a prayer-based evangelical ministry ( 1983 – 88 ) .
The site was dedicated on March 24 , 1983 , and within three years congregations and home groups were established in eighty-two towns .
The same approach was applied to more than three hundred cities , and over the ensuring months it expanded to six continents . Dr .
Silvoso is internationally acknowledged as a foremost leader of the Argentine Revival .
Thousands have visited over the past twenty years to observe his methodology in order to apply the same principles in their regions .
As a result , many have adopted his concept of transformation , and this culminated in his latest volume , &amp; quot ; Transformation : Change the Marketplace and You Change the World &amp; quot ; ( 2007 ) .
The ministry is distinguished for dealing with systemic social problems and understanding global marketplace changes , the effectiveness of which is recorded in an extensive series of documentaries . Ed Silvoso is best known for his role in transformationalism and is identified as the architect of the modern movement .
It blends various religious and social elements to change local communities and the marketplace .
The term &amp; quot ; marketplace &amp; quot ; includes business , education , and government and applies to marriage , politics , culture , and workplace .
Over the past decade , he has provided much of the terminology for transformationalism as well as a strategic template to accomplish it .
Its intent is to bring spiritual , motivational , relational , and material wealth to local communities . The movement developed into the International Transformation Network ( ITN ) that was established to create strategic alliances between pulpits and marketplace leaders .
Members are challenged to invest fifty-one percent of resources to eradicate worldwide poverty .
The network currently consists of over a thousand active members on six continents .
Five paradigms are at the core of ITN , and they involve changes in spiritual climate , public policies , and ecclesiastical institutions .
The network urges Christian leaders to participate in eliminating systemic poverty in all its forms . Since Dr .
Silvoso developed the principles that define the transformation movement , in many ways his latest book is an extension and , to some degree , an application of them .
It is entitled &amp; quot ; Ekklesia &amp; quot ; , and in this volume he discusses the intent of the early church .
He compares what is described in the New Testament to its modern institutionalized form and points out that the term generally translated as “ church ” originally applied to assemblies in antiquity .
He utilizes this concept to distinguish between the three main religious traditions at the time of Jesus in order to rediscover its initial meaning during the apostolic age . The first three chapters of this book were distributed in limited number , and the full version is projected in late 2016 .
Dr .
Silvoso introduces six transition points that enable the modern “ church ” a successful return to the type of communities the apostles founded : In essence , he defines &amp; quot ; ekklesia &amp; quot ; as “ an all-encompassing transforming organism . ” One of the most important themes in this study is its emphasis on returning to marketplace Christianity , the description of which was previously published .

Oshkosh L-ATVThe Oshkosh L-ATV ( Light Combat Tactical All-Terrain Vehicle ) is a light utility / combat multi-role vehicle that won the US military &amp; apos ; s Army-led Joint Light Tactical Vehicle ( JLTV ) program .
In the very early stages of the program it was suggested that JLTV would replace the AM General High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle ( HMMWV ) on a one-for-one basis .
It is now suggested that the JLTV will part-replace the HMMWV , not replacing it on a like-for-like basis . Oshkosh &amp; apos ; s L-ATV will deliver a level of protection similar to that of current , but far heavier and less maneuverable , Mine Resistant Ambush Protected ( MRAP ) class designs , these having far more protection from blast than even the latest up-armored HMMWVs . On 25 August 2015 , the L-ATV was selected as the winner of the JLTV program .
The first JLTV delivery order was placed in March 2016 with the U . S .
Army ordering 657 trucks .
Overall JLTV requirements are 5,500 vehicles for the Marine Corps entering service in FY 2020 with all to be delivered in FY 2022 , and 49,099 for the Army entering service in late 2019 with deliveries occurring through 2040 .
The Army received its first seven JLTVs for test at the end of September 2016 , Colonel Shane Fullmer , JLTV project manager stated at an AUSA 2016 media briefing . The idea for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle ( JLTV ) first emerged in 2006 from threats experienced during the Iraq War .
The primary tactical wheeled vehicle used by the U . S .
military at the start of the war was the Humvee .
However , it was unarmored and built for payload mobility , so the type incurred heavy losses when improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) began being employed by insurgents .
The initial response was to add armor to existing Humvees , and primarily on the sides .
This improved side protection against direct fire and associated threats , but since the chassis was not designed to handle any further additional weight , there was little room for underbody protection .
The additional weight impacted on overall reliability and compromised off-road mobility . To combat increasing numbers of IED attacks , the U . S .
spent around $ 50 billion rapidly procuring some 29,000 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected ( MRAP ) vehicles , including the Oshkosh M-ATV for use in Iraq and Afghanistan .
While MRAPs offered superior protection from IEDs , especially underbody blasts , they were significantly larger and heavier and had poor off-road mobility .
The military incorporated MRAPs in response to operational needs , but never intended them to become a permanent part of their tactical wheeled vehicle fleets .
At the conclusion of operations , many thousands were either scrapped , adapted for other roles , or offered for sale / transfer to allies .
Ultimately U . S .
armed forces would retain over 11,100 MRAPS , just over 6,350 of these Oshkosh M-ATVs .
The bulk of retained MRAPS will ultimately be mothballed in prepositioned stocks around the world . Since up-armoring Humvees and buying MRAPs addressed specific issues but created gaps in vehicle capabilities , the JLTV program was started to incorporate lessons learned and balance payload , mobility , and protection into a new vehicle .
Its purpose was to restore the mobility commanders had with the original Humvee , while having the side and underbody protection of a basic MRAP .
It would be around two-thirds the weight of an MRAP , possible to be carried under a CH-47 Chinook and CH-53E Super Stallion and by amphibious vessels , things impossible for an MRAP .
It would also be 70 percent faster off-road , adding to survivability by enabling it to egress a combat situation faster .
Compared to the Humvee , the JLTV was to have the mobility of early unarmored versions with greater protection than up-armored versions , along with greater reliability , payload capacity , and ease of repair .
The JLTV is the first vehicle purpose-built for network connectivity into the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical . Oshkosh Defense first displayed the L-ATV at Association of the United States Army ( AUSA ) in Washington , D . C .
on 10 October to 12 October 2011 .
This , the first &amp; apos ; public appearance &amp; apos ; for the design , was not an open appearance and came in the form of closed combined briefings / viewings to invited attendees only .
Oshkosh briefed Jane &amp; apos ; s Independent Defense Review that the L-ATV has developmental origins that trace back to 2007 and Oshkosh / Northrop-Grumman &amp; apos ; s failed JLTV proposal , with some sub-systems having a lineage that trace back to 2005 .
At the time , L-ATV was the lightest tactical vehicle designed by Oshkosh , being some 50 % lighter than anything previously produced by the company . At AUSA 2011 , Oshkosh suggested that following then recent program developments , L-ATV would be offered to meet the recently revitalized JLTV &amp; apos ; s EMD ( Engineering &amp; amp ; Manufacturing Development ) phase .
On 26 January 2012 , the RFP for JLTV &amp; apos ; s EMD Phase was released .
On 23 August 2012 , the Army and Marine Corps selected the Oshkosh Defense L-ATV , as well as the Lockheed Martin JLTV entry and AM General BRV-O , as the winners of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development ( EMD ) phase of the JLTV competition .
They were awarded a contract to build 22 prototype vehicles in 27 months to be judged by the services . On 6 February 2013 , Oshkosh unveiled the Utility Variant of its JLTV offer , fulfilling JLTV &amp; apos ; s requirement for a two-seat cargo vehicle .
The vehicle &amp; apos ; s performance was demonstrated at the 2013 NATC Technology Rodeo at the Nevada Automotive Test Center ( NATC ) .
The Utility Variant is designed to provide mobility for loads such as containers , pallets , and break bulk cargo .
It can also be outfitted as a shelter carrier to carry standard shelters for communications systems , on-board electronics , and other functions .
Payload capacity is in excess of 5,100 pounds .
Both Oshkosh L-ATV variants leverage a common crew protection system , automotive systems , and the patented Oshkosh TAK-4i ™ intelligent independent suspension system . In June 2013 , L-ATV prototypes participated in an event hosted by the U . S .
JLTV Joint Program Office in Quantico , VA .
The vehicles successfully completed the severe off-road track ( SORT ) without failure .
The SORT demonstrated the L-ATV &amp; apos ; s ability to maneuver steep inclines , turn sharply , and operate in rugged terrain .
On 8 August 2013 , Oshkosh delivered its first L-ATV JLTV prototype to the Army for government testing following a successful vehicle inspection by the Defense Contract Management Agency ( DCMA ) .
The four-door variant ( which has two base platforms – Close Combat Weapons Carrier ( CCWC ) and the General Purpose ( GP ) ) and two-door Utility Variant were provided for evaluations . On 27 August 2013 , the Army and Marine Corps announced that full-scale testing of JLTV prototypes would begin the following week , with all three vendors having had 66 vehicles delivered .
Each company delivered 22 vehicles and six trailers to Aberdeen Proving Ground , Maryland , and Yuma Proving Ground , Arizona .
Previous testing had already put the vehicles through more than 400 ballistic and blast tests on armor testing samples , underbody blast testing , and more than 1,000 miles in shakedown testing .
Soldiers from the Army Test and Evaluation Command and personnel from the Defense Department &amp; apos ; s Office of Test and Evaluation would begin to put the vehicles through realistic and rigorous field testing during 14 months of government performance testing .
Testing was scheduled for completion by FY 2015 , with a production contract to be awarded to a single vendor for almost 55,000 vehicles ( 49,099 Army ; 5,500 Marines ) .
The average unit manufacturing cost in A-kit ( fitted for but not with armor ) configuration was not to exceed $ 250,000 .
The Army set an Initial Operating Capability ( IOC ) of May 2018 and planned to complete its fielding by FY2040 .
The Marines had an IOC of December 2017 , and planned to complete its fielding by FY2022 .
On 3 September 2013 , full-pace , full-scope JLTV testing began at Aberdeen Proving Ground , Yuma , and Redstone Arsenal , Alabama .
One vendor was to be selected by July 2015 , and produce 2,000 vehicles for three years of additional testing to fine-tune the assembly line and full-up the system . In July 2014 , the L-ATV completed Net-Ready testing as part of the JLTV program , involving transferring data from onboard systems to external networks .
On 17 July 2014 , Oshkosh announced the L-ATV had completed 200,000 miles and all requirements for Reliability , Availability , Maintainability ( RAM ) testing .
On 19 November 2014 , Oshkosh announced the L-ATV had completed Limited User Testing ( LUT ) with the U . S .
Army and Marine Corps for the JLTV EMD contract .
The LUT focused on JLTV system capabilities , functions , operations , and interfaces in a range of simulated tactical environments covering operator and crew-level preventive maintenance for the entire system , ensuring they could operate proficiently and safely .
The Army held theirs the previous September and October , where three tests were held as 96-hour cycles to simulate operational missions , one of which incorporated a live fire demonstration .
The Marines completed two test cycles in October and November with one live fire demonstration .
The Army released the final JLTV RFP on 12 December 2014 .
On 10 February 2015 Oshkosh Defense issued a press release announcing the company had submitted its proposal ( the L-ATV ) in response to the JLTV Low Rate Initial Production ( LRIP ) and Full Rate Production ( FRP ) RFP . On 31 March 2015 , Oshkosh announced it would show its JLTV offering , the L-ATV , at the AUSA 2015 Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville , Alabama .
The company also announced it would show its Virtual Task Trainer ( VTT ) for the L-ATV at the conference .
The VTT is an interactive training module that provides interactive 3D training for soldiers in a safe and lifelike virtual environment .
Speaking of the VTT , Mike Ivy , vice president of global integrated product support for Oshkosh Defense said : &amp; quot ; The addition of Oshkosh &amp; apos ; s virtual training to our multi-faceted curriculum reduces the cost of operator training by improving training effectiveness and efficiency . &amp; quot ; He added : &amp; quot ; We deployed the VTT to train operators during early JLTV testing with great results .
Soldiers were really engaged , and our training was not only better , but it took less time than it would have without the VTT .
This represents a significant cost savings opportunity for the government . &amp; quot ; On 25 August 2015 , the Army selected the Oshkosh L-ATV as the winner of the JLTV program .
The company was awarded a $ 6 . 75 billion low rate initial base contract with eight option years to procure the first 16,901 vehicles for both the Army and Marines .
Oshkosh CEO , Charles Szews , said the production contract award would involve more than 300 suppliers in 31 states across the country .
The Army initially refused to detail why the L-ATV was chosen over its competitors , likely owing to anticipations of protests from the losing bidders . On 8 September it was disclosed that Lockheed Martin would protest the award to Oshkosh ; on the same day it was also disclosed that AM General had decided not to file a protest .
Any work that would be performed under the contract stopped during the review period .
On December 15 the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) dismissed Lockheed Martin &amp; apos ; s protest because the company on December 11 decided to file a “ Notice of Post-Award Bid Protest ” with the U . S .
Court of Federal Claims ; according to a source with knowledge of the procedures , it is uncommon for a company to file with the court close to a GAO protest decision .
Immediately after the GAO dismissed the protest , the Army instructed Oshkosh to resume work on the JLTV order .
Lockheed filed their preliminary injunction on 17 December , claiming that new Army-supplied information related to the contract emerged toward the end of the GAO ’ s protest process that was not considered before their ruling and no deadline extension was granted .
On 17 February 2016 , Lockheed withdrew their protest of the JLTV contract award decision in the Court of Federal Claims , potentially as a result of the release of JLTV testing data showing that the L-ATV lasted nearly six times longer between significant breakdown than Lockheed &amp; apos ; s vehicle . The first JLTV order was announced on 23 March 2016 with the U . S .
Army ordering 657 JLTVs .
The $ 243 million order includes vehicles for the Army and Marines .
For clarity , as part of the original JLTV LRIP / FRP Base Award in August 2015 , an initial 201 JLTVs for the test and evaluation phase were ordered .
The 657-vehicle order is an exercised option from the program &amp; apos ; s eight option years . In June 2017 the first US soldiers to receive JLTVs was revealed .
According to the Army its first unit to receive JLTVs will be an infantry brigade combat team in the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum and according to the Marines , a yet-to-be-identified infantry battalion within II Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , will receive its JLTVs in July 2019 .
Also in June 2017 the Marines revealed they wished to adjust their acquisition objective for JLTV by 65 % to up to 9,091 vehicles .
For clarity , overall JLTV requirements still remain 5,500 for the USMC and 49,099 for the army .
In August 2017 further details the U . S .
Air Force &amp; apos ; s FY18 budget request for JLTVs were published .
Beginning in FY 2019 , the first of 140 units could be fielded , these including 46 Utility variants , 48 General Purpose variants , and 46 Heavy Gun Carrier variants , these to be operated by Air Force security forces , explosive ordnance disposal teams , pararescue and personnel recovery units , tactical air control party teams , and special tactics forces .
The Air Force wishes to eventually replace its entire inventory of 3,270 Humvees with JLTVs . On 1 Sept 2017 Oshkosh announced the sixth JLTV order , this including 611 vehicles and 1,789 installed and packaged kits .
The order is valued at more than $ 177 million .
Oshkosh also confirmed the JLTV remains on-schedule and on-budget .
At AUSA 2017 JLTV &amp; apos ; s were displayed in three new configurations .
Oshkosh displayed a General Purpose variant fitted with a Boeing Compact Laser Weapon System ( CLWS ) , a Kongsberg Protector LW 30 Remote Weapon System ( RWS ) with a M230LF cannon , and a communications suite that includes a Thales VRC-111 and Thales VRC-121 VIPER .
The company also displayed a Utility variant equipped with the Boeing Maneuver Short Range Air Defense ( SHORAD ) Launcher including a M3P . 50 cal machine gun , M299 launcher with four Longbow Hellfire missiles , sensor suite , and a communications suite including a Thales VRC-111 .
Rafael displayed a General Purpose vehicle fitted with the company &amp; apos ; s Samson RWS Dual Stabilized Remote Weapon Systems ( RWS ) with M230 LF , and the Trophy Light Active Protection System ( APS ) . On 21 December 2017 , Oshkosh announced the seventh JLTV order , this valued at $ 100 . 1 million and including 258 vehicles and associated installed and packaged kits .
At this time it was also announced that to date over 1,000 JLTVs had been delivered .
On 5 February 2018 , Oshkosh announced the eighth JLTV order , this valued at $ 106 million and including 416 vehicles and associated installed and packaged kits .
This eighth order brings the total of JLTVs ordered to date to 3,430 .
Full-rate production should begin in November or December 2019 ahead of fielding , and initial operating capability is expected for early to mid-2020 .
For clarity , overall JLTV requirements still remain 5,500 for the USMC and 49,099 for the army . In June 2016 , the British Ministry of Defence ( MOD ) confirmed it was discussing a potential Foreign Military Sales ( FMS ) deal with the U . S .
military for the L-ATV .
The vehicle is being considered for the British Army &amp; apos ; s Multi Role Vehicle-Protected ( MRV-P ) Package 1 requirement for troop carrying and other light duties , part of a program to equip the Army with several types of wheeled armored vehicles to support rapid deployment and regular forces .
It is not typical for the U . S .
government to do FMS sales until there is a full production rate decision on the equipment , but that requirement could be waived given the overall maturity of the JLTV platform .
In July 2017 , the Defense Department announced the UK planned to spend up to US $ 1 . 04 billion to supply the British military with a maximum of 2,747 of the vehicles . The Lithuanian Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) has contacted the U . S .
Defense Department regarding a potential acquisition of about 200 Oshkosh L-ATV light tactical vehicles .
Under the proposed acquisition , the value of which has not been mentioned , deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2021 . The L-ATV is based around Oshkosh &amp; apos ; s TAK-4i ( i = intelligent ) independent suspension system .
Around 26,000 military vehicles are fitted with an earlier version of the system , these including the Oshkosh Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement ( MTVR ) , Oshkosh Logistic Vehicle System Replacement ( LVSR ) , and Oshkosh MRAP All-Terrain Vehicle ( M-ATV ) ; the TAK-4 system has also been retro-fitted to the Force Protection Inc Cougar and BAE Systems RG-33 MRAPs .
The majority of systems supplied to date have been coil-sprung .
The TAK-4i version fitted to the L-ATV remains undisclosed , but is not coil-sprung and is of the variable adjustable ride-height type with up to of wheel travel , 25 percent more than the current standard . Motive power for the JLTV variant of the L-ATV is provided by a digitally-controlled Gale Banks Engineering 866T V-8 diesel , this based on the architecture of the General Motors ( GM ) Duramax .
Power output is undisclosed but estimated to be around 300 hp .
In commercial use power output of the Duramax engine is currently up to 397 hp ( 296 kW ) at 3000 rpm .
An unspecified fully automatic six-speed Allison Transmission is fitted , this coupled to an Oshkosh transfer case .
It is currently not known if this is a single-speed or two-speed ( high / low ratio ) transfer case .
The L-ATV can be fitted with the Oshkosh ProPulse diesel-electric powertrain , previously fitted to the Oshkosh Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck ( HEMTT ) and MTVR .
According to Oshkosh literature , the ProPulse diesel-electric powertrain dramatically improves fuel economy by up to 35 percent in certain circumstances and serves as an on-board generator with enough output to power an entire airfield or hospital , generating up to 120 kW of AC power for external operations ; the hybrid powertrain is not a requirement of the JLTV program .
In a Limited User Test ( LUT ) , the L-ATV demonstrated reliability of 7,051 &amp; quot ; Mean Miles Between Operational Mission Failure , &amp; quot ; more than the Humvee and either other JLTV competitor . The L-ATV offers protection levels greater than those of up-armored HMMWVs and comparable to those of original MRAP class designs , but in an overall vehicle package that is considerably smaller and lighter than vehicles procured under the US Marines MRAP procurement .
The L-ATV is fully compliant with the US Army &amp; apos ; s Long Term Armor Strategy ( LTAS ) , based around the A-kit / B-kit modular armor principle .
The A-kit , which is installed during build , is primarily fixings for add-on armor but can include small amounts of armor fitted in difficult-to-reach areas .
The B-kit is essentially the add-on armor , this added when required and as a modular add-on .
According to the US Army , the A-kit / B-kit concept allows the Army flexibility in several areas : the armor B-kit can be taken off when not needed – reducing unnecessary wear and tear on the vehicles ; the Army can continue to pursue upgrades in armor protection – adapting B-kits to match the threat ; and the versatility of the B-kit enables the transfer of armor from unit to unit – making armor requirements affordable by pooling assets versus buying armor that is only for one vehicle .
Oshkosh developed the CORE 1080 crew protection system for the vehicle , comprising the hull design , armor materials , a fire-extinguishing system , and energy-absorbing floors , seats , and restraint systems for crew members and stowage . The Oshkosh M-ATV , which was procured primarily for Afghanistan where the earlier and bigger / heavier MRAPs had mobility issues , has protection comparable to the original MRAP designs , but while smaller it still remains a relatively large vehicle .
During the L-ATV design process , every component was optimized for survivability , resulting in the same level of protection in a vehicle 30 percent smaller .
This resulted in a curb weight for the JLTV requirement of , almost one-third the weight of the heavier MRAP ( 4x4 ) models , and almost half the weight of the original MRAP models .
Payload allowance for the JLTV in Combat Tactical Vehicle ( CTV ) configuration was four passengers and of cargo , and in Combat Support Vehicle ( CSV ) configuration was two passengers and of cargo . The base L-ATV does not have a standard armament , however it can be fitted with a selection of weapons including light , medium , and heavy machine guns , automatic grenade launchers , or anti-tank guided missiles ( ATGMs ) depending on user requirements .
The weapons can be operated from ring mounts or a remote weapon station .
Smoke grenade launchers for self-defence can also be fitted if required . The JLTV family and its nomenclature evolved throughout the development process and to date the U . S .
Army has allocated M designations to four individual JLTV configurations .
The JLTV family now consists of three base vehicle platforms , Utility ( JLTV-UTL ) , Close Combat Weapons Carrier ( JLTV-CCWC ) and General Purpose ( JLTV-GP ) .
The Utility base vehicle platform is a two-door configuration , the General Purpose and Close Combat Weapons Carrier base vehicle platforms are a four-door configuration .
Standard U . S .
military M-designators are applied base vehicle platforms when outfitted to a specific Mission Package Configuration .
These currently are : There is also a companion trailer ( JLTV-T ) , this towable by all JLTV variants . Additionally , On 11 May 2016 , the Army confirmed a plan , suggested since late 2015 , to use the JLTV as a solution for the Light Reconnaissance Vehicle ( LRV ) requirement .
Some changes will need to be made to the base L-ATV vehicle to meet LRV requirements .
In May 2017 it was reported that the JLTV-RV ( JLTV - Reconnaissance Vehicle ) is to be incorporated into the current JLTV Technical Data Package ( TDP ) and will be a kit option on the next JLTV contract .
The JLTV-RV is designated as the interim solution for the LRV requirement .

Drury railway stationDrury railway station was a station on the North Island Main Trunk line in New Zealand .
It was a stop for southern services on the Auckland railway network . The Auckland and Drury Railway Act 1863 was passed by Parliament &amp; quot ; to enable the Superintendent of the Province of Auckland to construct a Railway between the Towns of Auckland and Drury with a Branch to Onehunga in the said Province . &amp; quot ; The station opened in October 1874 .
On 8 December 1918 , the existing station was replaced by a new Drury station building on a new site which also replaced the Runciman Railway Station .
On 21 May 1972 the station was closed .
New train stations for Drury West and Paerata are included in a July 2017 proposal for Auckland infrastructure spending of $ 600 million to support new housing announced by the government .
They will be built and owned by a new Crown Infrastructure Partners body , as the Auckland Council has reached its borrowing limit .

Runciman railway stationRunciman railway station was a station on the North Island Main Trunk in New Zealand , serving an area which had been sold by James Runciman in 1864 , with plots near the proposed railway gaining higher prices .
It was initially planned that the terminal of the Auckland and Drury Railway would be north-east of the settlement , but a longstanding offer of Runciman &amp; apos ; s land was still open in 1864 and it was built there instead . There was debate about the location of the station as early as 1874 .
Although the line was complete by late 1873 , the first passenger train didn &amp; apos ; t run until 7 October 1874 and complaint continued about delays in opening the line .
Possibly the delay was due to threats to blockade the line to force trains to stop at Runciman .
Drury became a crossing point for trains on the official opening to Mercer on 20 May 1875 .
It seems Drury station was known as Runciman , though the name didn &amp; apos ; t become official until July 1879 .
The disputes over location seem to have continued throughout the station &amp; apos ; s existence .
By 1895 it had cattle loading facilities .
The name was briefly changed to Oira in 1909 . Until 1917 Runciman station was next to a level crossing on the Great South Rd .
Work then began to replace the crossing with a bridge , ease the gradient and build a new Drury station between Runciman and Drury , despite a protest petition about the move a few chains away .

Paerata railway stationPaerata railway station was a station on the North Island Main Trunk in New Zealand , serving the Paerata settlement . The station was opened on 20 May 1875 .
The station was closed to passengers on 17 July 1977 , and to all traffic on 1 October 1982 .
A crossing loop was retained .
New train stations for Drury West and Paerata are included in a July 2017 proposal for Auckland infrastructure spending of $ 600 million to support new housing announced by the government .
They will be built and owned by a new Crown Infrastructure Partners body , as the Auckland Council has reached its borrowing limit .

Trinity College ClockThe Trinity College Clock is an historic clock in Trinity College , Cambridge .
King Edward &amp; apos ; s Gate , in Trinity Great Court , otherwise known simply as the clock-tower , is one of the oldest buildings in the college .
The first clock appears to have been installed in 1610 by Thomas Tennant , of London .
The bell has survived to this day and bears the inscription : TRINITAS IN UNITATE RESONAT 1610 .
RICARDUS HOLD FELD ME FECIT .
In 1726 – 1727 the clock mechanism was given to the village of Orwell , Cambridgeshire when the master , Richard Bentley , provided a new clock and dial plate and three bells .
It is noted for striking the hour twice , first on a low note ( the &amp; apos ; Trinity &amp; apos ; chime ) and then a higher one ( the &amp; apos ; St John &amp; apos ; s &amp; apos ; chime ) .
In 1910 this eighteenth-century clock was replaced with a mechanism by Smith of Derby to a design by Lord Grimthorpe . The clock is governed by a temperature-compensated pendulum 2 metres in length driven by a three-legged gravity escapement .
It is a remarkable instrument , capable of keeping time to better than one second in a month without any intervention . The clock is the subject of a current project coordinated by Dr Hugh Hunt , Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge , calibrating it against the National Physical Laboratory time signal and other variables , including the amplitude of the pendulum , humidity , air temperature , air pressure , and air density .
Flat graveA flat grave is a burial in a simple oval or rectangular pit .
The pit is filled with earth , but the grave is not marked above the surface by any means such as a tumulus or upstanding earthwork .
Both intact human bodies ( skeletal grave ) and cremated remains ( urn grave ) were buried in the graves . This simple method of burial was used often by prehistoric peoples .
It was used during the Funnelbeaker culture and Corded Ware culture .
It was characteristic of the Urnfield culture which stored cremated remains in urns and buried them in flat graves . Burial customs did not always follow a pattern of continuously increasing sophistication in history .
During the early La Tène culture the deceased were optionally cremated and then interred in tumulus tombs , but this changed during the later period .
At that time tumulus tombs became rare and the interment of cremated remains in flat graves was the dominant method of burial again .

Hangatiki railway stationHangatiki railway station was a station on the North Island Main Trunk in New Zealand .
In 1915 Hangatiki was described as a small township with a post and telegraph office , where passengers for &amp; quot ; the famous Waitomo and Ruakuri caves alight &amp; quot ; .
The guidebook said Waitomo was away , &amp; quot ; by good metalled road , a conveyance meeting the express trains and conveying passengers to the excellent Government Accommodation House at Waitomo . &amp; quot ; The fare was 2 / 6 each way ( about $ 18 in 2015 money ) .

The station opened in 1880 at the same time the NIMT was extended to Te Awamutu , though it wasn &amp; apos ; t mentioned in the press until postal contracts were being let in 1881 .
In the early years it was a vital part of local farm transport .
Apart from electrification , the only significant work since then seems to have been in 1928 , when a lengthy embankment and raised bridge over the Mangapiko Stream lifted the line about , to ease the climb from Te Awamutu to Ngaroto . Ngaroto only featured in annual reports for 3 years -

IHME Contemporary Art FestivalIhme Contemporary Art Festival ( also written as &amp; quot ; IHME &amp; quot ; ) is a yearly festival for contemporary art produced by Pro Arte Foundation Finland .
The festival includes a public work of art , a varied programme of events around the artwork , and educational art projects .
Ihme Project , commissioned by the Festival , is to be realised in the public realm .
A varied Festival programme ranging from artist talks to film screenings opens up the Ihme Project for discussion and debate and is free to attend .
Ihme also offers an art education programme , Ihme School , with various activities .
The word &amp; quot ; ihme &amp; quot ; means a wonder or a miracle in Finnish . Pro Arte Art Foundation Finland seeks to promote art as a resource for democratic society , and as an important part of human life and everyday existence .
The Foundation ’ s aim is to enhance the status and visibility of visual art , to improve the relationship between visual art and the public , and to make it more accessible .
The Foundation ’ s work is international in scope and directed at anyone interested in culture .
The expert team of Ihme invites the artist to conceive the project , and also plans the programme of the festival .
The expert team of the foundation is : ( chair ) , , Hanna Johansson , Paula Toppila , and Timo Valjakka . Each year , Pro Arte Foundation Finland invites an internationally recognized visual artist or group of artists to make a temporary work of art in public space .
The way the IHME Project is to be carried out , along with its form and location , are jointly determined by the Foundation and the selected artist . A varied Festival programme aims to increase interest in the visual arts and to deepen the public ’ s relationship to it .
The programme ranges from talks related to the Ihme Project and other topical issues to film screenings and other types of public programming including music and workshops , varying from year to year .
Speakers contributing to the programme of talks include artists , also including the Festival artist , as well as academics and professionals from different fields .
Admission to all events is free . IHME publications document the events of the annual festival as a digital online publication . IHME School consists of educational art projects and workshops .
The Festival collaborates with schools and universities , as well as The City of Helsinki Youth Division , and produces programmes for different target groups to make contemporary art more accessible . The IHME Project artist 2017 Theaster Gates brought to Helsinki his experimental musical ensemble , The Black Monks of Mississippi .
The group , founded and led by Gates , offered to Helsinki audience a journey of exploration into the power of the voice and into the potential of improvisation .
Gates &amp; apos ; s body of works titled &amp; quot ; The Black Charismatic &amp; quot ; took place 5 – 29 April 2017 and consisted of : a film shown at the Finnkino Tennispalatsi cinema ; a live concert at the Rock Church ; a video installation shown in the Finnish Salvation Army Temple ; and the release of a three-LP recording . The new venue for the programme of talks and films was the Gloria Cultural Arena .
The two-day event tackled themes emerging from Gates ’ s practice : the meaning of art and cultural appropriation .
Under discussion were also themes raised by Hannah Arendt ’ s thinking .
Two series of films screened at the Festival mirrored Gates ’ s production .
The main stage for the IHME Project 2016 was a Helsinki icon : the tram .
The work was commissioned from the Czech artist Kateřina Šedá , who invited street musicians to perform on all Helsinki tram routes on March 16 – 19 .
During its four days , the &amp; quot ; Tram Buskers ’ Tour &amp; quot ; provided more than 300 hours of live music and reached a total of nearly 24,000 tram passengers . The Tour featured artists from both Finland and abroad , including : Antti Tolvi ; Bence Boka ; Chano ; DVA ; EntreCuerdas ; The Entropies ; Hermanni Turkki ; Hester &amp; amp ; Holly Rose ; Kaikuluotain ; Kiiora ; Mario Parizek ; PAM ; Sagolik ; SAffrAn ; The Space Lady ; Stephen Paul Taylor ; Steve Aruni and Funky Monkeys ; Sybren Renema ; TBeeGirls ; and Whale On . The main Festival Partners were Helsinki City Transport and Helsinki Region Transport . There were more than 1100 visitors to the IHME Days over the weekend of April 1 – 3 .
The themes of the programme of talks were : communities and art ; connections between art and education , especially phenomenon-centred learning ; and the question of what artists do when they create art .
Marie-Louise Ekman ’ s art exhibition was new to the programme : a series of the artist ’ s prints produced by Tensta Konsthall in Stockholm was on view throughout the weekend . The British artist Jeremy Deller designed the Ihme Project 2015 entitled &amp; quot ; Do Touch . &amp; quot ; In this new work , the public had a chance to inspect objects from the collections of Helsinki ’ s historical museums for a week in March 2015 .
The artist selected the objects together with the staff of the collaborating museums .
The staff members were trained to give further information on the objects and the time period they were used .
The project was realised in partnership with the following museums in Helsinki : Customs Museum , Design Museum , Finnish Museum of Natural History , Helsinki City Museum , Military Museum , Museum of Technology and National Museum of Finland . Ihme Festival ’ s talks programme dealt with the themes of the current Ihme Project .
At the core of this year ’ s public commission by Jeremy Deller were the following : the past in the present ; the object as a mediator of information and experience ; and the artist as curator .
The last theme was aimed at contemporary-art professionals .
Ihme also discussed other topical subjects : the fragmentation of the media in the Internet age , and the multi-dimensional way in which the art of curating manifests itself in the field of visual art . The Ihme Project 2014 was created by the Israeli artist Yael Bartana .
The project under the title &amp; quot ; True Finn – Tosi suomalainen &amp; quot ; was a communal experiment .
Participants living in Finland and coming from different ethnic , religious and political backgrounds took part .
Participants went through tasks that deal with cultural differences but also similarities .
The project was compiled as a video art work .
The film ’ s premiere was on March 31 , 2014 at the Bio Rex cinema in Helsinki . The Ihme Days 2014 took place at the Old Student House in Helsinki April 4 – 6 , 2014 .
Festival ’ s discussions , films , club and workshops centred on themes of national identity and multiculturalism . The Ihme Project artist 2013 was the Polish artist Miroslaw Balka Miroslaw Balka with &amp; quot ; Signals &amp; quot ; .
It was an art project carried out together with Helsinki residents during four days , 4 – 7 April 2013 .
Miroslaw Balka wanted to give the time and space in his artwork to the residents of Helsinki , and to their most important questions .
Each event started with the questions signaled in the urban space using semaphore-flag signals , after which an open discussion of the topics began .
Residents , politicians and experts participated equally in the discussions . Ihme Days 2013 took place 11 – 14 April 2013 at the Old Student House in Helsinki .
The theme of the Days was the art &amp; apos ; s potential to function as catalyst for change . Ihme Publication 2013 was a part of Miroslaw Balka &amp; apos ; s artwork , consisting of two advertisements in the Metro newspaper on 27 September 2012 and 21 March 2013 . In the year 2012 &amp; quot ; The Heart Archive &amp; quot ; by the French artist Christian Boltanski expanded the scope of the IHME Contemporary Art Festival to four Finnish cities .
The project was staged simultaneously in Helsinki , Joensuu , Rovaniemi , and Vaasa during 12 March - 1 April 2012 .
Each installation of &amp; quot ; The Heart Archive &amp; quot ; takes the form of a space where recordings are made of human heartbeats .
The heartbeats have been collected since 2008 from all over the world to an archive on Teshima island in Japan . Themes for the IHME Days 2012 were collecting and the archive .
The Days took place at the Old Student House in Helsinki 23 – 25 March 2012 . Christian Boltanski &amp; apos ; s IHME Edition was published in newspapers as a series of advertisements published in the four newspapers : Pohjalainen ( Vaasa ) , Karjalainen ( Joensuu ) , Lapin Kansa ( Rovaniemi ) and NYT ( the weekly supplement of Helsingin Sanomat , Helsinki ) . The Danish artists &amp; apos ; group Superflex installation created for the Ihme Contemporary Art Festival 2011 was a film and sculpture titled &amp; quot ; Modern Times Forever &amp; quot ; in front of the Stora Enso Building in Helsinki 23 March - 2 April 2011 .
The film was shown in Helsinki Market Square on a 40m ² LED screen , so that one could see the original building simultaneously with the building in the film .
The film lasted over ten days and could be watched 24 hours a day .
The movie is one of the longest films in the world . The Ihme Days 2011 were held at the Old Student House in Helsinki 1 – 3 April 2011 .
The themes of the festival derived from the IHME Project 2011 and were the time , the city and the future . The Ihme Project 2010 was the sound installation &amp; quot ; When Day Closes &amp; quot ; designed by the Scottish artist Susan Philipsz for the Helsinki Central Railway Station .
The artwork was presented 12 March - 11 April 2011 .
In the work the artist performs unaccompanied &amp; quot ; The Song of My Heart &amp; quot ; ( Sydämeni laulu ) composed by Jean Sibelius to a poem by Aleksis Kivi . The Ihme Days 2011 were held 26 – 28 March 2010 at the Old Student House in Helsinki .
The themes were sound as art work and art in public space . Ihme Edition 2010 was &amp; quot ; Free Shop &amp; quot ; by Superflex .
The artwork takes place in an ordinary shop .
Anything purchased in the shop by any given customer is free of charge .
&amp; quot ; Free Shop &amp; quot ; was realized during September 2010 - March 2011 . British sculptor Antony Gormley was the artist to conceive the first Ihme Project in 2009 .
Gormley created a work called &amp; quot ; Clay and the Collective Body &amp; quot ; in the Kaisaniemi sports field in Helsinki , bringing together clay and Helsinki locals in a specially erected pneumatic building .
The artwork was realized in two phases .
In the first phase 22 – 24 March 2009 the public was allowed to view the constructed clay cube .
In the second phase 25 March - 3 April 2009 , the public had an opportunity to work on and with the clay and to use it to make objects of any kind .
The work took place in four-hour sessions , with about 2,000 participants . The first Ihme Days were held at the Old Student House in Helsinki 3 – 5 April 2009 .
The themes of the days were who makes art and who is art made for . The second Ihme Edition was a video work &amp; quot ; After Closedown &amp; quot ; by the artist Susan Philipsz that had its premiere at YLE Teema TV Channel on September 24 , 2009 .
In the video , the artist sings the themes of two movies , &amp; quot ; The Wicker Man &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Rosemary &amp; apos ; s Baby &amp; quot ; .
The video work was shown for two weeks as the last programme of the evening . The first Ihme Edition was a full-page newspaper announcement devised by Antony Gormley .
The Edition appeared in the newspapers Helsingin Sanomat and Metro on Friday 28 March 2008 and in Hufvudstadsbladet on 29 March 2008 .
The idea of the announcement was to tell people about the existence of the Pro Arte Foundation Finland and its work , and also to invite readers to take part in Gormley &amp; apos ; s project in Helsinki in 2009 . The first Ihme production was Ihme 0 ; films and videos by international contemporary artists .
The film programme was screened in Bio Rex cinema in Helsinki on 29 March 2008 .
Blastobasis pulchellaBlastobasis pulchella is a moth in the family Blastobasidae .
It is found in North America , including Nova Scotia , Washington DC and Maine . The ground colour of the forewings is pale ochreous-brown with a silver white fascia at one-third , heavily shaded with dark brown .
Rangpur StadiumRangpur Stadium is a cricket and football ground near Police Lines School and College and Islampur Jame Mosque in the city of Rangpur , Bangladesh .
It is on the north side of Rangpur Cricket Garden .
It has a capacity of 25,000 .
Organ of TömösváryTömösváry organs , also known as temporal organs or postanntennal organs are specialized paired sensory organs found in certain groups of myriapods ( e . g .
centipedes and millipedes ) and hexapods ( e . g .
springtails ) , located on the head near the base of the antennae .
Various function of Tömösváry organs have been proposed , including sensing vibration , humidity , or light , although evidence for their true function is conflicting , and in groups such as millipedes its true function is unknown .
The organs were first described by Hungarian biologist Ödön Tömösváry in 1883 .
Crowdsourcing software developmentCrowdsourcing software development or software crowdsourcing is an emerging area of software engineering .
It is an open call for participation in any task of software development , including documentation , design , coding and testing .
These tasks are normally conducted by either members of a software enterprise or people contracted by the enterprise .
But in software crowdsourcing , all the tasks can be assigned to or are addressed by members of the general public .
Individuals and teams may also participate in crowdsourcing . Software crowdsourcing may have multiple goals . Quality software : Crowdsourcing organizers need to define specific software quality goals and their evaluation criteria .
Quality software often comes from competent contestants who can submit good solutions for rigorous evaluation . Rapid acquisition : Instead of waiting for software to be developed , crowdsourcing organizers may post a competition hoping that something identical or similar has been developed already .
This is to reduce software acquisition time . Talent identification : A crowdsourcing organizer may be mainly interested in identifying talents as demonstrated by their performance in the competition . Cost reduction : A crowdsourcing organizer may acquire software at a low cost by paying a small fraction of development cost as the price for award may include recognition awards . Solution diversity : As teams will turn in different solutions for the same problem , the diversity in these solutions will be useful for fault-tolerant computing . Ideas creation : One goal is to get new ideas from contestants and these ideas may lead to new directions . Broadening participation : One goal is to recruit as many participants as possible to get best solution or to spread relevant knowledge . Participant education : Organizers are interested in educating participants new knowledge .
One example is nonamesite . com sponsored by DARPA to teach STEM Science , Technology , Engineering , and Mathematics . Fund leveraging : The goal is to stimulate other organizations to sponsor similar projects to leverage funds . Marketing : Crowdsourcing projects can be used for brand recognition among participants . Architecture support . A crowdsourcing support system needs to include 1 ) Software development tools : requirement tools , design tools , coding tools , compilers , debuggers , IDE , performance analysis tools , testing tools , and maintenance tools .
2 ) Project management tools : ranking , reputation , and award systems for products and participants .
3 ) Social network tools : allow participants to communicate and support each other .
4 ) Collaborating tools : For example , a blackboard platform where participants can see a common area and suggest ideas to improve the solutions presented in the common area . Social networks . Social networks can provide communication , documentation , blogs , twitters , wikis , comments , feedbacks , and indexing . Organization . Processes . Any phase of software development can be crowdsourced , and that phase can be requirements ( functional , user interface , performance ) , design ( algorithm , architecture ) , coding ( modules and components ) , testing ( including security testing , user interface testing , user experience testing ) , maintenance , user experience , or any combination of these . Existing software development processes can be modified to include crowdsourcing : 1 ) Waterfall model ; 2 ) Agile processes ; 3 ) Model-driven approach ; 4 ) Open-Sourced approach ; 5 ) Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS ) approach where service components can be published , discovered , composed , customized , simulated , and tested ; 6 ) formal methods : formal methods can be crowdsourced . The crowdsourcing can be competitive or non-competitive .
In competitive crowdsourcing , only selected participants will win , and in highly competitive projects , many contestants will compete but few will win .
In non-competitive manner , either single individuals will participate in crowdsourcing or multiple individuals can collaborate to create software .
Products produced can be cross evaluated to ensure the consistency and quality of products and to identify talents , and the cross evaluation can be evaluated by crowdsourcing . Items developed by crowdsourcing can be evaluated by crowdsourcing to determine the work produced , and evaluation of evaluation can be crowdsourced to determine the quality of evaluation . Notable crowdsourcing processes include AppStori and Topcoder processes . Pre-selection of participants is important for quality software crowdsourcing .
In competitive crowdsourcing , a low-ranked participant should not compete against a high-ranked participant . Platforms . Software crowdsourcing platforms including Apple Inc . ’ s App Store , Topcoder , and uTest demonstrate the advantage of crowdsourcing in terms of software ecosystem expansion and product quality improvement .
Apple ’ s App Store is an online iOS application market , where developers can directly deliver their creative designs and products to smartphone customers .
These developers are motivated to contribute innovative designs for both reputation and payment by the micro-payment mechanism of the App Store .
Within less than four years , Apple ’ s App Store has become a huge mobile application ecosystem with 150,000 active publishers , and generated over 700,000 IOS applications .
Around the App Store , there are many community-based , collaborative platforms for the smart-phone applications incubators .
For example , AppStori introduces a crowd funding approach to build an online community for developing promising ideas about new iPhone applications .
IdeaScale is another platform for software crowdsourcing . Another crowdsourcing example — Topcoder — creates a software contest model where programming tasks are posted as contests and the developer of the best solution wins the top prize .
Following this model , Topcoder has established an online platform to support its ecosystem and gathered a virtual global workforce with more than 1 million registered members and nearly 50,000 active participants .
All these Topcoder members compete against each other in software development tasks such as requirement analysis , algorithm design , coding , and testing . The Topcoder Software Development Process consists of a number of different phases , and within each phase there can be different competition types : Each step can be a crowdsourcing competition . BugFinders testing process : Game theory has been used in the analysis of various software crowdsourcing projects . Information theory can be a basis for metrics . Economic models can provide incentives for participation in crowdsourcing efforts . Crowdsourcing software development may follow different software engineering methodologies using different process models , techniques , and tools .
It also has specific crowdsourcing processes involving unique activities such as bidding tasks , allocating experts , evaluating quality , and integrating software .
To support outsourcing process and facilitate community collaboration , a platform is usually built to provide necessary resources and services .
For example , Topcoder follows the traditional software development process with competition rules embedded , and AppStori allow flexible processes and crowd may be involved in almost all aspects of software development including funding , project concepts , design , coding , testing , and evaluation . The reference architecture hence defines umbrella activities and structure for crowd-based software development by unifying best practices and research achievements .
In general , the reference architecture will address the following needs : Particularly , crowdsourcing is used to develop large and complex software in a virtualized , decentralized manner .
Cloud computing is a colloquial expression used to describe a variety of different types of computing concepts that involve a large number of computers connected through a real-time communication network ( typically the Internet ) .
Many advantages are to be found when moving crowdsourcing applications to the cloud : focus on project development rather than on the infrastructure that supports this process , foster the collaboration between geographically distributed teams , scale resources to the size of the projects , work in a virtualized , distributed , and collaborative environment . The demands on software crowdsourcing systems are ever evolving as new development philosophies and technologies gain favor .
The reference architecture presented above is designed to encompass generality in many dimensions including , for example different software development methodologies , incentive schemes , and competitive / collaborative approaches .
There are several clear research directions that could be investigated to enhance the architecture such as data analytics , service based delivery , and framework generalization .
As systems grow understanding the use of the platform is an important consideration , data regarding users , projects , and interaction between the two can all be explored to investigate performance .
These data may also provide helpful insights when developing tasks or selecting participants .
Many of the components designed in the architecture are general purpose and could be delivered as hosted services .
By hosting these services the barriers for entry would be significantly reduced .
Finally , through deployments of this architecture there is potential to derive a general purpose framework that could be used for different software development crowdsourcing projects or more widely for other crowdsourcing applications .
The creation of such frameworks has had transformative effects in other domains for instance the predominant use of BOINC in volunteer computing . Crowdsourcing in general is a multifaceted research topic .
The use of crowdsourcing in software development is associated with a number of key tension points , or facets , which should be considered ( see the figure below ) .
At the same time , research can be conducted from the perspective of the three key players in crowdsourcing : the customer , the worker , and the platform . Task decomposition : Coordination and communication : Planning and scheduling : Quality assurance : A software crowdsourcing process can be described in a game process , where one party tries to minimize an objective function , yet the other party tries to maximize the same objective function as though both parties compete with each other in the game .
For example , a specification team needs to produce quality specifications for the coding team to develop the code ; the specification team will minimize the software bugs in the specification , while the coding team will identify as many bugs as possible in the specification before coding . The min-max process is important as it is a quality assurance mechanism and often a team needs to perform both .
For example , the coding team needs to maximize the identification of bugs in the specification , but it also needs to minimize the number of bugs in the code it produces . Bugcrowd showed that participants will follow the Prisoner &amp; apos ; s Dilemma to identify bugs for security testing . Knowledge and Intellectual Property : Motivation and Remuneration : There are the following levels of crowdsourcing : Level 1 : single persons , well-defined modules , small size , limited time span ( less than 2 months ) , quality products , current development processes such as the one by Topcoder and uTest .
At this level , coders are ranked , websites contains online repository crowdsourcing materials , software can be ranked by participants , have communication tools such as wiki , blogs , comments , software development tools such as IDE , testing , compilers , simulation , modeling , and program analysis . Level 2 : teams of people ( &amp; lt ; 10 ) , well-defined systems , medium large , medium time span ( 3 to 4 months ) , adaptive development processes with intelligent feedback in a blackboard architecture .
At this level , a crowdsourcing website may support adaptive development process and even concurrent development processes with intelligent feedback with the blackboard architecture ; intelligent analysis of coders , software products , and comments ; multi-phase software testing and evaluation ; Big Data analytics , automated wrapping software services into SaaS ( Software-as-a-Service ) , annotate with ontology , cross reference to DBpedia , and Wikipedia ; automated analysis and classification of software services ; ontology annotation and reasoning such as linking those service with compatible input / output . Level 3 : teams of people ( &amp; lt ; 100 and &amp; gt ; 10 ) , well-defined system , large systems , long time span ( &amp; lt ; 2 years ) , automated cross verification and cross comparison among contributions .
A crowdsourcing website at this level may contain automated matching of requirements to existing components including matching of specification , services , and tests ; automated regression testing . Level 4 : multinational collaboration of large and adaptive systems .
A crowdsourcing website at this level may contain domain-oriented crowdsourcing with ontology , reasoning , and annotation ; automated cross verification and test generation processes ; automated configuration of crowdsourcing platform ; and may restructure the platform as SaaS with tenant customization . Microsoft crowdsourcing Windows 8 development .
In 2011 , Microsoft started blogs to encourage discussions among developers and general public .
In 2013 , Microsoft also started crowdsourcing their mobile devices for Windows 8 .
In June 2013 , Microsoft also announced crowdsourcing software testing by offering $ 100K for innovative techniques to identify security bugs , and $ 50K for a solution to the problem identified . In 2011 the United States Patent and Trademark Office launching a crowdsourcing challenge under the America COMPETES Act on the Topcoder platform to develop for image processing algorithms and software to recognize figure and part labels in patent documents with a prize pool of $ 50,000 USD .
The contest resulted in 70 teams collectively making 1,797 code submissions .
The solution of the contest winner achieved high accuracy in terms of recall and precision for the recognition of figure regions and part labels . Oracle uses crowdsourcing in their CRM projects . A software crowdsourcing workshop was held at Dagstuhl , Germany in September 2013

Old Madiwala Someshwara Temple , BangaloreOld Madiwala Sri Someshwara Temple located in Bangalore city ( also Bengaluru ) is dedicated to the deity Someshwara ( the Hindu god Shiva ) .
It is one among the oldest temples in the city and dates back to the Chola Empire period .
The temple belongs to the early 12th century . ( 1247 AD ) . The temple houses a &amp; quot ; Swayambu &amp; quot ; Shiva lingam in it Sanctum Sanctorum ( Shiva lingam formed by natural Rock Formation ) .
But unlike other ancient temples in Bangalore , this temple is in good shape and cared well by people around .
This shows the real strength people have in protecting our heritage without outside help .
It is very &amp; quot ; powerful &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Ancient &amp; quot ; temple . The Someshware temple at Madivala is one of Bangalore &amp; apos ; s oldest , dating back to the Chola period .
There are a number of Tamil and Grantha inscriptions on the outer walls of the temple .
The oldest of these inscriptions dates to 1247 AD talks about a land grants &amp; quot ; below the big tank of Vengalur &amp; quot ; by a Veppur ( modern Begur ) resident .
Other inscriptions also talk about other land grants including those done during the reigns of Ballala III and Rajendra Chola .
Another instrciption dated 1365 talks about land grand at Tamaraikkirai ( which translates to &amp; apos ; lotus pond bank &amp; apos ; in Tamil , and according to HS Gopala Rao , Secretary of the Karnataka Itihasa Academy refers to the present day Tavarekere suburb . Begur is referred Veppur in the inscription .
It is to be noted that some of the Tamil words starting with a &amp; apos ; va &amp; apos ; are pronounced in Kannada as &amp; apos ; ba &amp; apos ; From inscriptions ( 1365 AD ) , it is known that Taverekere was once called &amp; quot ; Tamaraikkirai &amp; quot ; . Tamaraikkirai meaning &amp; apos ; the banks of the lotus pond &amp; apos ; in Tamil languageMaha Shivratri : Celebrated every year on Month of February in the Krishna Paksha ( waning moon ) of the month of Maagha ( as per Shalivahana ) or Phalguna ( as per Vikrama ) in the Hindu Calendar ( that is , the night before and day of the new moon ) . Pradosham : Occurs once in every 15 days and considered most auspicious by Shaivites , it occurs almost 2 days before either Amavasya ( black moonday ) or Pournima ( full moon day ) .

RSPCA NSWRSPCA NSW is a not-for-profit charity operating in New South Wales , Australia that promotes animal welfare . The idea behind the creation of an animal welfare charity in NSW has its roots in sentiments opposing the maltreatment of animals that were expressed by social reformers , clergy and politicians in Great Britain in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century .
Some early legislative efforts to ban practices such as bull-baiting in the English parliament were made in 1800 and 1809 , the former effort led by William Johnstone Pulteney ( 1729-1805 ) and the latter by Lord Erskine ( 1750-1823 ) but the proposed Bills were defeated . The first successful passage of anti-cruelty legislation in England &amp; apos ; s parliament occurred in 1822 under the direction of the Irish politician Richard Martin ( 1754-1834 ) who was nicknamed by King George IV as &amp; quot ; Humanity Dick . &amp; quot ; Around the same time that Martin was drafting his anti-cruelty Bill , the Reverend Arthur Broome ( 1779-1837 ) had letters published in periodicals in which he canvassed for expressions of interest in forming a voluntary organisation to promote animal welfare and oppose cruelty .
The creation of voluntary groups that agitated for legal and social reform through the patronage of aristocrats , clergy and parliamentarians was not unusual in Broome &amp; apos ; s day , particularly in the case of the abolitionist or anti-slavery movement .
After the passage of Richard Martin &amp; apos ; s anti-cruelty to cattle bill in 1822 , Broome attempted to form a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that would bring together the patronage of persons who were of social rank and committed to social reforms .
Broome did organise and chair a meeting of sympathisers in November 1822 where it was agreed that a Society should be created and at which Broome was named its Secretary but the attempt was short-lived . It was at Broome &amp; apos ; s invitation that a number of social reformers gathered on 16 June 1824 at Old Slaughter &amp; apos ; s Coffee House , London to create a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
The meeting was chaired by Thomas Fowell Buxton MP ( 1786-1845 ) and the resolution to establish the Society was voted on .
Among the others who were present as founding members were Sir James Mackintosh MP , Richard Martin , William Wilberforce , Basil Montagu , John Ashley Warre , Rev .
George Bonner ( 1784-1840 ) , Rev .
George Avery Hatch ( 1757-1837 ) , Sir James Graham , John Gilbert Meymott , William Mudford , and Lewis Gompertz .
Broome was appointed as the Society &amp; apos ; s first honorary secretary .
The Society received the Royal prefix , which was bestowed by Queen Victoria , in 1840 and thereafter became known as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . In the colony of NSW some concerns about the maltreatment of animals were expressed in 1804 and 1805 in &amp; quot ; The Sydney Gazette and NSW Advertiser &amp; quot ; . The journalist then referred to various acts of brutality that had been reported concerning a pig and a dog and evidently believed that the anti-cruelty law of England also applied in NSW . In 1837 a correspondent wrote to the &amp; quot ; Sydney Herald &amp; quot ; to complain about the non-existence of a colonial equivalent to England &amp; apos ; s Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , and the paper echoed the sentiment that such an organisation was needed .
When the gold-rush struck in the NSW western town of Bathurst , further concerns were expressed about the need for anti-cruelty legislation in NSW that would mirror Britain &amp; apos ; s laws .
News from England about the prosecution of individuals sponsoring cock-fighting was reported in the Sydney press in 1863 .
Articles were sometimes published that referred back to past notable English characters , such as Sir Matthew Hale ( 1609-1676 ) , who had made known their sentiments about opposing cruelty toward animals . A groundswell of public opinion in NSW in favour of the creation of anti-cruelty legislation as well as an anti-cruelty organisation began to be expressed in editorials in 1864 and then in letters to newspapers in 1867 .
Similar sentiments about the necessity of passing anti-cruelty laws and creating organisations similar to England &amp; apos ; s RSPCA were published in the newspapers in the colonial states of Victoria , South Australia , Queensland , Tasmania and Western Australia from the 1860s until the early 1890s as each colonial state established an SPCA ( South Australia 1875 , Tasmania , 1878 , Queensland 1883 , Western Australia 1892 ) .
The first anti-cruelty society organisation that was created in the Australian colonies occurred in Melbourne , Victoria on 4 July 1871 known as the Victorian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . An anonymous letter to the editor seeking expressions of interest to create an anti-cruelty organisation was published in the &amp; quot ; Sydney Morning Herald &amp; quot ; on 3 July 1873 .
On Thursday 10 July 1873 a meeting was held in the offices of Mr R .
Want of Pitt Street , Sydney where the resolution was voted for and passed : At the meeting the positions of honorary secretary ( Mr Charles Lett ) and honorary treasurer ( Mr A .
Sandeman ) were filled .
On Wednesday , 16 July 1873 a meeting convened at 132 Pitt Street , Sydney in Mr Sandeman &amp; apos ; s office to establish the rules and to elect officers to positions in the newly created Society .
On Monday 28 July 1873 it was announced at a committee meeting that the Society &amp; apos ; s first President would be the prominent Anglican Sir Alfred Stephen ( 1802-1894 ) who had served as the Third Chief Justice of NSW .
He also served in the NSW Legislative Council and on four separate occasions he unsuccessfully attempted to have an animals protection bill passed . The Society &amp; apos ; s first annual meeting was held at the Temperance Hall in Pitt Street , Sydney on 6 August 1874 , and Sir Alfred Stephen presided .
Also in attendance were several prominent public officials including Sir Saul Samuel ( 1820-1900 ) a Jewish community leader and parliamentarian , Mr E .
Fosbery ( Superintendent of Police ) , Rev .
Dr .
Charles Badham ( 1813-1884 ) a lecturer at the University of Sydney , Rev .
William Ridley ( 1819-1878 ) , and Mr George Oakes MLA ( 1813-1881 ) .
The annual report was read out , further resolutions were voted on and prizes were awarded to schoolboys for essays written about cruelty to animals . Frances Deborah Levvy ( 1831-1924 ) , who was a Jewish convert to Christianity , joined the NSW Society .
In 1884 she started for the education and benefit of children the Bands of Mercy which aimed to teach them to behave kindly toward animals .
In 1886 she founded and served as the honorary secretary of the Womens Branch of the SPCA .
She helped to drive a womens &amp; apos ; campaign by petitioning state politicians for the establishment of a stray dogs home in Sydney .
She also collaborated with various philanthropists to establish in 1921 a convalescent home for horses in Sydney &amp; apos ; s eastern suburb Little Bay .
Women members in the local branches of the SPCA organised social community events to raise the profile of the charity and the problem of cruelty , which included annual dances , garden parties and fund-raising activities .
The activities organised by the women &amp; apos ; s branch had , at times , to battle against apathy in the community and societal indifference concerning the problems of cruelty toward animals . RSPCA NSW was given its Royal Warrant in 1923 .
During the early to mid twentieth century some churches in NSW observed an annual &amp; quot ; Animal Sunday &amp; quot ; service to promote kindness to animals as well as raising awareness about the role of the RSPCA .
After World War 1 , RSPCA NSW published a periodical known as &amp; quot ; RSPCA Journal &amp; quot ; ( until 1942 ) , which was renamed &amp; quot ; Animals &amp; quot ; ( from 1942-2013 ) .
Since 1991 it has also published &amp; quot ; Waggy Tails &amp; quot ; as well as another periodical for children since 2008 called &amp; quot ; Animania &amp; quot ; . The RSPCA NSW inspectors were recognised as Special Constables by an amendment in 1943 to the Police Offences Act , 1901 .
In NSW the current relevant legislation that directly relates to the definition , investigation and prosecution of offenders who act cruelly toward animals is set out in the Prevention of Cruelty To Animals Act 1979 ( often abbreviated as POCTA ) . The RSPCA societies in the states and territories of Australia established the national body RSPCA Australia in 1981 .
During the twenty-first century the use and abuse of animals across Australia and within NSW has stimulated public debates on a range of issues including intensive agricultural farming , the live export trade , unlicensed puppy farms , animals used in circuses and rodeos , greyhound and horse racing .
RSPCA NSW has taken the position that the live export trade should be banned , that animals should not be kept in circuses , that puppy farms should be closed , and opposes the use of sow stalls .
These debates , which tend to produce partisan standpoints based on different philosophical and ethical theories about animal welfare as one approach and animal rights as another approach , have raised questions among lawyers , activist groups , representatives of primary industries and politicians about the role of the RSPCA and the adequacy of existing animal protection laws in NSW and across Australia . Although the RSPCA NSW receives a small percentage of its funding from the NSW Government the vast majority of it comes from the public as donations . The RSPCA has 2 major fundraising events each year .
In May it holds The Million Paws walk and on the 3rd Monday of August it holds a Cupcake day - which is due to start in 2013 . In addition to this the RSPCA Auxiliary and the RSPCA Volunteer branches also hold many fundraising events throughout the year . The RSPCA also receives bequests and offers fundraising at AidArena , online fundraising and in raffles . The RSPCA ( NSW ) runs 12 animal shelters , 4 veterinary of hospitals and 27 Volunteer branches , to assist in the rescue , treatment and re-homing of animals , and in de-sexing programs and has 30 Inspectors to investigate animal cruelty , mistreatment and abuse claims . The RSPCA ( NSW ) lists its objectives as : RSPCA NSW programs include : Living Ruff is a programme to assist people who find themselves homeless to keep their pets with them so as to reduce both the distress of a person who has suddenly become homeless through no fault of their own and their pet , and include programmes like : access to food for pets , emergency boarding and foster care for the pets of people who find temporary accommodation and access to vet services . A Program developed to assist older people by caring for their pets when they need medical treatment , assistance with grooming their pets and home visits to assist with basic care .
This program is targeted to socially isolated people who are over the age of 65 or in palliative care . This is a program to provide housing and care for the pets of people who are victims of domestic violenceThis is an initiative run jointly with many organisations including councils and Veterinary hospitals .
Its goal is to reduce unwanted companion animal populations through educating about many of the responsibilities of pet owners , to increase de-sexing rates in the companion animal community and promote responsible pet ownership . The Dog Rehabilitation Program is jointly run with the Commissioner of Corrective Service NSW .
It aims to give minimum security prisoners skills in the pet related industry by giving the prisoners nationally accredited training , while rehabilitating dogs so that they can be re-homedThe RSPCA NSW has been criticised for the fact it has consistently had kill rates above 50 % for the duration of Steve Coleman &amp; apos ; s tenure as CEO .
It has had this kill rate despite many local pounds working in conjunction with rescue groups managing to get kill rates to 15 % or less .
It is claimed that despite running at a profit ( $ 10 million last year ) and having far more public viability than most rescue organisations , as well as the largest total animals destroyed of any single organisation , and was included on a government panel on reducing animal deaths in pounds and shelter , on which rescue groups were excluded .
They advised that rather than a mandatory kill limit , better Guidelines be put in place &amp; apos ; .
There is concern that without a mandatory kill % limit there will be no change in the organisation &amp; apos ; s practices . There planned 100 person vigil outside the RSPCA &amp; apos ; s Million Paws Walk 2013 in memory of Max the Pointer , who it was alleged was put down for claimed behavioural issues that the Justice4Max protest group claimed were unfounded . There were also concerns that RSPCA NSW fails to work with other animal rescue groups in NSW .
In the case of the Rutherford facility , records indicate that not a single animal has been released to a rescue group since the 1 August 2011 .
These have caused such concern that a councillor in Maitland brought forth a motion to see whether the RSPCA might be in a ) in breach of its contract that requires the RSPCA to &amp; apos ; consider involving local certified rescue groups to assist in re-homing animals &amp; apos ; and b ) as a function of a ) whether the council is now in breach of the Companion Animals Act NSW section 64 “ It is the Duty of the council concerned to consider an alternative action to that of destroying the animal and ( if practicable ) to adopt any such alternative . ” However , in response to these claims Mr Picton of the RSPCA &amp; apos ; s Rutherford facility stated “ We don ’ t usually release animals to rescue groups , but there is no law requiring us to ” The RSPCA &amp; apos ; s Temperament test , which it uses as grounds for 60 + % of its euthanasia justifications , is not publicly available .
Its application and situational use has been criticised as many of the behaviours in it are exhibited by frightened dogs as well , which makes its use unacceptable according to some people .
One of the people who claim to have helped devise the test also states it is used incorrectly – that it was intended to be used as a guide to assess the rehabilitation requirements of the dog – not justify euthanising it . Also there has been a study By Monash university found that the temperament testing may not be being applied correctly or properly , casting further doubt on its usefulness , as a quarter of people using it to assess dogs had not been trained to and more than half believed they were not given enough time to assess the dogs .

Ray Miller ( bandleader ) Ray Miller ( &amp; quot ; possibly &amp; quot ; born James Raymond Miller , 1896 – 1974 ) was an American bandleader who was popular during the 1920s .
In 1924 his orchestra performed at the White House with Al Jolson , the first jazz band to do so . Relatively little is known of Miller &amp; apos ; s private life .
He may have been born in Reading , Pennsylvania .
In 1916 , he worked as a singing waiter at the Casino Gardens in Chicago , home of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band ( ODJB ) .
Miller followed the ODJB to New York City , where he formed a band , the Black and White Melody Boys , featuring himself on drums and New Orleans native Tom Brown on trombone .
The band performed in vaudeville and featured in several musical productions before disbanding . Miller formed a dance band around 1920 .
Its members , at different times , included Ward Archer ( drums ) ; Charlie Rocco ( trumpet ) ; Miff Mole ( trombone ) ; Danny Yates ( violin ) ; Roy Johnston ( trumpet ) ; Rube Bloom and Tommy Satterfield ( piano ) ; Louie Chasone ( tuba ) ; Frank Trumbauer , Andy Sannella , Billy Richards and Andy Sandolar ( saxophones ) ; and Frank O .
Prima ( banjo ) .
The orchestra recorded for various labels , notably Columbia and OKeh , before signing an exclusive contract with Brunswick Records in late 1923 .
They increasingly played jazz-influenced music — especially after Mole and Trumbauer joined in 1924 — and held residencies at the New York Hippodrome and Arcadia Ballroom , and in Atlantic City .
The orchestra &amp; apos ; s most successful recordings included &amp; quot ; The Sheik of Araby &amp; quot ; ( OKeh , 1922 ) , &amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; ll See You In My Dreams &amp; quot ; ( Brunswick , 1925 ) , and &amp; quot ; When It &amp; apos ; s Springtime in the Rockies &amp; quot ; ( Brunswick , 1930 ) .
&amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; ll See You In My Dreams &amp; quot ; was written by Isham Jones , who performed it with the band . On October 17 , 1924 , the orchestra became the first jazz band to play at the White House , where they performed with Al Jolson at a campaign rally for President Calvin Coolidge .
They also recorded with Jolson , notably on Irving Berlin &amp; apos ; s song &amp; quot ; All Alone &amp; quot ; in late 1924 .
After Mole and Trumbauer left , Miller moved his base to the Hotel Gibson in Cincinnati , Ohio , in 1927 , and performed regularly for the powerful radio station WLW .
He left Cincinnati and formed a new band in Chicago in 1928 , which for a few months included trumpeter Muggsy Spanier and clarinetist Volly De Faut .
Miller and his orchestra recorded regularly for Brunswick in Chicago until 1930 . Miller left the music business sometime after 1930 .
His later life is not publicly recorded , but it has been suggested that Miller invested heavily into the Stock Market before 1929 , and lost a good deal of money after the markets crashed in October of that year .
He is believed to have died in 1974 .

Phoa Keng HekPhoa Keng Hek Sia ( ; 1857 – 1937 ) was a Chinese Indonesian social activist and first president of Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan , an influential Confucian educational and social organisation meant to better the position of ethnic Chinese in the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) .
He served from its establishment in 1900 until 1923 . Phoa was born in Buitenzorg ( now Bogor ) , Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) , in 1857 into an influential &amp; quot ; Peranakan &amp; quot ; Chinese family .
His father , Phoa Tjeng Tjoan , held the post of Kapitein der Chinezen of Buitenzorg .
This was a civil government position in the Dutch colonial administration with legal and political jurisdiction over the local Chinese community .
As the son of a Chinese officer , the younger Phoa held the hereditary title of &amp; quot ; Sia &amp; quot ; .
His great-nephew , Phoa Liong Gie ( born 1904 ) , would later attain prominence as a jurist , politician and newspaper owner .
Phoa &amp; apos ; s earliest formal education was in a school run by ethnic Chinese , but after Sierk Coolsma opened a missionary school in Bogor on 31 May 1869 , Phoa was in the first class of ten .
Among his classmates was Lie Kim Hok , who would later become known as a writer .
At this school Phoa studied , among other subjects , Dutch .
Although the school was meant to convert people to Christianity , Phoa remained well-versed in Confucianism . After graduating Phoa married the daughter of a Chinese lieutenant in Batavia ( now Jakarta ) , the capital of the Indies , and he moved there to be with his wife .
The couple had a daughter , Tji Nio , who later married Majoor Khouw Kim An , last titular head of the Chinese community of Batavia .
Phoa proved very outspoken and soon he was a viewed as a leader of Batavia &amp; apos ; s Chinese .
Because he had a command of Dutch , used by the colonial forces , Phoa was able to easily interact outside of Chinese and native groups . In 1900 Phoa , together with his former classmate Lie , was an establishing member of the Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan ( THHK ) school system and social organisation .
He served as the president of THHK for twenty-three years before retiring , and was assisted by his son-in-law &amp; apos ; s cousin , the philanthropist Oen Giok Khouw , as vice-president .
The organisation promoted rights for ethnic Chinese and the use of Chinese and English amongst ethnic Chinese .
In 1907 , Phoa – under the pseudonym &amp; quot ; Hoa Djien &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; A Chinese &amp; quot ; ) – used a series of letters to the editor of the daily &amp; quot ; Perniagaan &amp; quot ; to criticise the Dutch colonial government and its policies towards the ethnic Chinese .
He wrote that the Indies offered little opportunity to ethnic Chinese , who should instead look abroad .
He wrote &amp; quot ; if they are literate in Chinese and English , they can just take a two- or three-day voyage ( Java-Singapore ) into a wider world where they can move freely . &amp; quot ; Outside of the THHK , Phoa was an active landlord .
He bought some land in Bekasi , south-east of Batavia , and in 1903 succeeded in banning gambling in the area .
As did his father before him , Phoa sold agricultural products .
He owned a rice mill and tea factory . Phoa was made a Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1937 .
He died in Batavia later that year , on 19 July , and was buried after a large funeral at Petamburan Cemetery on 25 July .
As he had no male issue , one of his daughter &amp; apos ; s sons , Phoa Liong Djin , assumed his surname and succeeded him as head of the family .

Ahr Valley RailwayThe Ahr Valley Railway ( ) , Remagen – Ahrbrück , is currently a 29 km-long , partly single-track and non-electrified branch line , which runs through the Ahr valley from Remagen via Ahrweiler and Dernau to Ahrbrück in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate .
It is served by Regionalbahn services on line RB 30 ( Deutsche Bahn timetable route number 477 ) . The history of the Ahr Valley Railway begins as a branch line from the West Rhine Railway ( &amp; quot ; Linke Rheinstrecke &amp; quot ; ) .
This line was built up the Rhine from Cologne to Rolandseck via Bonn by the Bonn – Cologne Railway Company ( &amp; quot ; Bonn-Cölner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft &amp; quot ; ) between 1844 and 1856 ; it was extended to Bingerbrück via Remagen and Koblenz by the Rhenish Railway Company ( &amp; quot ; Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft &amp; quot ; ) in 1858 / 59 . On 23 September 1879 , a ministerial decree was issued to authorise the building of the Ahr Valley Railway .
Less than a year later , the Rhenish Railway opened the first section from Remagen to Ahrweiler on 17 September 1880 .
This was extended to Altenahr on 1 December 1886 and to Adenau on 15 July 1888 . For strategic reasons , two other lines were added in the Ahr valley in 1912 and 1913 , establishing a small Ahr Valley Railway network .
In 1912 , the Dümpelfeld – Hillesheim ( Eifel ) – Lissendorf line was opened ; this followed the upstream half of the Ahr and then branched off into the Ahlbach valley at Ahrdorf .
The third side a triangle of railways was built to connect the two lines ( the Dümpelfeld curve from Liers junction to Insul junction ) . In 1913 , the Ahrdorf – Blankenheim railway was opened ; this ran up the rest of the Ahr valley from Ahrdorf to its source and then connected with the Eifel Railway . There was a locomotive depot ( Bahnbetriebswerk ) in the middle of the line at Kreuzberg and lying parallel with it .
At the same time , the original line was partially relocated and the Ahr Valley Railway was duplicated from Remagen to Liers junction . Construction was commenced on other new lines , such as the &amp; quot ; strategic railway &amp; quot ; that was intended to connect the Ahr valley from Dernau with Neuss via Rheinbach and Liblar bypassing Cologne , but they were not completed due to the First World War I and the subsequent disarmament imposed under the peace treaty .
The unfinished bridge at Ahrweiler has been in ruins above the village since 1925 .
During World War II , the already completed tunnels in the Ahr valley were used for the armaments industry , using forced labour , and were redeveloped between 1960 and 1972 as the government bunker .
The A 61 autobahn now runs on part of the line near Meckenheim and Rheinbach . An extension south of Adenau did not complete its planning stage .
Again , the main reasons for building the line would have been of a military nature . Also for strategic reasons , the Ahr Valley Railway was extended over the Ludendorff Bridge ( also known as the Bridge at Remagen ) to connect with the East Rhine Railway ( &amp; quot ; Rechte Rheinstrecke &amp; quot ; ) to and from the north .
However , the bridge was not completed until 1918 .
It was not rebuilt after its collapse just before the war ended in 1945 . The construction of the Siegfried Line gave the Ahr Valley railways great strategic importance .
Therefore , it was heavily damaged by Allied air raids and by German demolitions with explosives during the Second World War .
Nevertheless , the line was fully reopened by 1951 .
In the following years it was then partially closed and dismantled . Limited passenger services were restored between Remagen and Kreuzberg on 2 June 1985 and extended to Ahrbrück ( formerly Brück ( Ahr ) ) in June 1996 .
Freight traffic between Hönningen ( Ahr ) and Adenau was abandoned on 31 May 1985 .
Freight traffic between Ahrbrück and Hönningen ( Ahr ) was abandoned on 31 December 1996 and the line to Hönningen ( Ahr ) was dismantled in order to build a bypass road . The Ahr Valley Railway is still duplicated to the Walporzheim crossover . At the end of the 1990s , trains on the line were hauled by diesel locomotives of DB classes 213 and 215 ; DB Class 628 diesel multiple units were also operated . The disused former second track between Mayschoß and Rech is now used for a rail trail , the &amp; quot ; Ahr-Radweg &amp; quot ; ( Ahr Cycleway ) .
The two adjoining branch lines are partially used as cycle ways . The Ahr Valley Railway is served by the &amp; quot ; Rhein-Ahr-Bahn &amp; quot ; Regionalbahn service ( RB 30 ) , running hourly each day over the entire line running through to Bonn Central Station ( &amp; quot ; Hauptbahnhof &amp; quot ; ) , and from Monday to Friday by the &amp; quot ; Ahrtal-Bahn &amp; quot ; , running hourly between Remagen and Dernau .
In the autumn on Saturdays and Sundays a service runs from Remagen to Kreuzberg ( Ahr ) every two hours . Services on the line are operated by DB Regio NRW using class 643 ( Bombardier Talent ) diesel multiple units at speeds of to 120 km / h . Rail services on the Ahr Valley Railway can be used with tickets of both the &amp; quot ; Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Mosel &amp; quot ; ( Rhine-Moselle Transport Association , VRM ) and the &amp; quot ; Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg &amp; quot ; ( Rhine-Sieg Transport Association , VRS ) , as well as the &amp; quot ; NRW-tarif &amp; quot ; , a fare system that applies throughout North Rhine-Westphalia .

British Airways Flight 2069British Airways Flight 2069 was a scheduled passenger flight operated by British Airways between Gatwick , England and Jomo Kenyatta Airport , Nairobi , Kenya .
At 5 am on 29 December 2000 , a mentally ill passenger stormed the cockpit and attempted to hijack the aircraft .
Captain William Hagan and his crew were able to apprehend the assailant while first officer Phil Watson regained control of the aircraft , quickly bringing the situation under control . The aircraft involved was a British Airways Boeing 747-436 , registered in the United Kingdom as &amp; quot ; G-BNLM &amp; quot ; . Around 5 am local time , the cockpit of a Boeing 747-400 on a British Airways scheduled flight from Gatwick to Jomo Kenyatta Airport was stormed by a mentally unstable Kenyan passenger named Paul Mukonyi .
Grabbing the yoke , he tried to execute a route change , which resulted in a struggle between him and First Officer Phil Watson that caused the aircraft to stall and plunge towards the earth .
This struggle was joined by Captain Hagan , who had gone for a rest break just before the attack .
Two passengers ( Henry Clarke Bynum and Gifford Murrell Shaw , both of Sumter , S . C . , USA ) in the upper deck were able to assist in wrestling Mukonyi from the yoke .
Violent pitch changes were responsible for minor injuries among four passengers ; one of the stewardesses broke her ankle .

Acid Dreams ( book ) Acid Dreams : The Complete Social History of LSD : the CIA , the Sixties , and Beyond , originally released as Acid Dreams : The CIA , LSD , and the Sixties Rebellion , is a 1985 non-fiction book by Martin A .
Lee and Bruce Shlain .
The book documents the 40-year social history of lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , beginning with its synthesis by Albert Hofmann of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals in 1938 .
During the Cold War period of the early 1950s , LSD was tested as an experimental truth drug for interrogation by the United States intelligence and military community .
Psychiatrists also used it to treat depression and schizophrenia .
Under the direction of Sidney Gottlieb , the drug was used by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) in cooperation with participating &amp; quot ; colleges , universities , research foundations , hospitals , clinics , and penal institutions &amp; quot ; .
LSD was tested on &amp; quot ; prisoners , mental patients , volunteers , and unsuspecting human subjects &amp; quot ; . In the mid to late 1950s , many intellectuals began experimenting with LSD .
Alfred Matthew Hubbard introduced Aldous Huxley to the drug in 1955 and Timothy Leary began taking it in 1962 .
By 1963 , LSD had escaped the laboratory and became popular as a legal recreational drug with the emerging counterculture .
Lee and Shlain argue that LSD influenced the social movements of the 1960s .
The Free Speech Movement began in 1964 , followed by the wide availability of street acid in 1965 , the birth of the hippie movement in 1966 , and the growing antiwar movement associated with the New Left .
In response to queries by journalists about a &amp; quot ; massive , illegal domestic intelligence operation &amp; quot ; by the Nixon Administration , government hearings were held in the 1970s .
Investigations by the Rockefeller Commission ( 1975 ) , the Church Committee ( 1976 ) , and a release of declassified documents under the Freedom of Information Act in 1977 which led to new Senate hearings that same year , uncovered information about LSD experiments for the first time . The book is divided into two parts composed of ten chapters , with the first part of the book based on many of the public hearings , reports , and declassified files .
Part one , &amp; quot ; The Roots of Psychedelia &amp; quot ; , consists of five chapters about the pioneering research by the intelligence , military , scientific , and academic community .
Part two , &amp; quot ; Acid for the Masses &amp; quot ; , contains five chapters about the hippie movement and the effects of LSD on the counterculture .
Since its initial release in 1985 , the book has received mostly positive reviews .
A revised edition was published by Grove Atlantic in 1992 , with a new introduction by essayist Andrei Codrescu . Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann first synthesized LSD at Sandoz Laboratories in 1938 , while searching for medicinal ergot alkaloid derivatives , but its potential use as a psychedelic was not discovered until 1943 .
Sandoz made LSD available as a psychiatric drug in 1947 .
In World War II , under the direction of William J .
Donovan , the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) experimented with cannabis as a truth serum but it was a failure .
The U . S .
Navy became interested in testing mescaline as a truth drug after discovering it was used on prisoners at the Dachau concentration camp .
From 1947-1953 , the navy experimented with testing mescaline and several different drugs on human subjects in Project CHATTER . In the 1940s , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) began experimenting with different techniques for interrogation — one used sedatives to induce a trance state while another used two different drugs , such as an upper and a downer .
Director Roscoe H .
Hillenkoetter authorized funds for a secret mind control project code named Project BLUEBIRD , which became Project ARTICHOKE in 1951 .
Project MKULTRA , a covert research operation run by the CIA &amp; apos ; s Scientific Intelligence Division , began experimenting with human behavioral engineering in 1953 .
LSD became illegal in 1966 .
CIA testing of drugs in various forms continued until 1967 .
LSD was listed as a Schedule I drug in 1970 . In 1974 , &amp; quot ; New York Times &amp; quot ; journalist Seymour Hersh , going on a government source , accused the Central Intelligence Agency of &amp; quot ; directly violating its charter &amp; quot ; and conducting &amp; quot ; a massive , illegal domestic intelligence operation during the Nixon Administration against the antiwar movement and other dissident groups in the United States &amp; quot ; .
The Rockefeller Commission was formed in 1975 to respond to these accusations .
The commission found that the CIA destroyed 152 files documenting LSD testing in 1973 to prevent public knowledge of illegality .
After 1975 , the media began reporting widely about how the CIA tested LSD as a &amp; quot ; mind control weapon &amp; quot ; .
In 1976 , the Church Committee reported that from 1954-1963 , the CIA &amp; quot ; randomly picked up unsuspecting patrons in bars in the United States and slipped LSD into their food and drink . &amp; quot ; In 1977 , a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to Project MKULTRA , which led to a subsequent joint hearing by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research in August 1977 . Investigative journalist Martin A .
Lee ( 1954 — ) was 14 years old during the height of the countercultural movement of the 1960s ; his personal motivation for writing the book was spurred by his attempt to understand himself and the culture he was a part of during this time .
His early interest in the Kennedy assassination led him to work with the Assassination Information Bureau , an activist group founded by Carl Oglesby .
While the group was pursuing leads on the killings of JFK and Oswald , Lee pursued a different angle involving drug testing and mind control , which eventually lead him to research the relationships — but not necessarily any conspiracy — between the CIA , drug testing , and the counterculture of the 1960s . With further research , Lee found a series of overlapping relationships involving the CIA , the Army , the scientific and psychiatric community , and literary culture as well as the Beat movement .
Lee maintains that the &amp; quot ; CIA was an unwitting midwife to the birth of the acid generation &amp; quot ; .
The role of the CIA , Lee surmises , was only one of many responsible for the emergence of the Sixties counterculture , &amp; quot ; a comingling of all these divergent streams &amp; quot ; . Lee and writer Bruce Shlain used approximately 20,000 pages of unclassified documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act as the source for their CIA and military drug experiment material .
Lee was living in Washington DC at the time the book was published . Acid Dreams was published by Grove Press in 1985 and by MacMillan UK ( London ) in 2001 .
The book was on the &amp; quot ; San Francisco Chronicle &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; bestseller list for six weeks .
Foreign-language editions of &amp; quot ; Acid Dreams &amp; quot ; have been published in France , the Czech Republic and in Spain .
In 1992 , Grove Atlantic published a revised edition with a new introduction by essayist Andrei Codrescu titled &amp; quot ; Whose Worlds are These ? &amp; quot ; , a play on a line from Robert Frost &amp; apos ; s poem , &amp; quot ; Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening &amp; quot ; .
Frost said he wrote the poem &amp; quot ; about the snowy evening and the little horse as if I &amp; apos ; d had a hallucination &amp; quot ; . Historian Richard H .
Immerman , former Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence at the United States Department of State , criticized the book for focusing too much on the social history of the drug culture and not enough on the history of the involvement of the CIA .
Physician and medical writer Andrew Weil praised the book for its &amp; quot ; engaging &amp; quot ; narrative and for showing &amp; quot ; the government &amp; apos ; s complicity in the drug problem &amp; quot ; .
Both psychotherapist Robert Leverant and librarian Jack Forman called the book &amp; quot ; well-researched &amp; quot ; .
However , Forman took exception to the overall length of the book and its confusing prose .
Forman also thought that the topic of LSD lacked analysis , with the authors resorting instead to apologetics .
Philosopher Duff Waring of York University called the book an &amp; quot ; excellent addition to the history of psychedelia &amp; quot ; and described the first part about declassified CIA files as &amp; quot ; tightly-written , first-class muck-raking . &amp; quot ; All page references to &amp; quot ; Acid Dreams &amp; quot ; refer to the revised May 1992 Grove Press paperback edition which includes a new introduction and afterword .
Yancannia StationYancannia Station most commonly known as Yancannia is a pastoral lease that operates as a sheep station in north west New South Wales . It is situated about south east of Tibooburra and north west of White Cliffs in the channel country of New South Wales . The property was purchased in 1872 by William James Reid where he steadily improved the run after starting with no fencing until he had a flock of approximately 200,000 sheep .
Thomas Shaw bought a half share in the property in 1877 which continued to 1895 when Reid sold his share to Shaw .
The station occupied an area of over one million acres .
Shaw paid £ 86,500 for the property of which 2,346 acres were freehold , 542,744 acres were leasehold and 546,867 acres were resumed area .
It was stocked with 153,000 sheep , 310 cattle and 270 horses .
The district was gripped by drought in 1891 and about 87,000 sheep died as a result of lack of feed .
In the middle of 1896 Shaw reported to the Wilcannia land board that the carrying capacity had been reduced by a quarter owing to the presence of rabbits and the rise of wild dog numbers in the area . Sidney Kidman acquired the station in 1916 .
Drought soon followed and in 1919 the area suffered terrible losses .
Foxes had also become problematic by killing weaker stock and lambs , a total of 1442 foxes were killed on the property in six months of the same year . By 1924 the area was being plagued by dingos , Yancannia had been carrying flocks of up to 170,000 sheep but since the pest arrived numbers had dropped substantially to approximately 94,000 . Mary Turner Shaw , the granddaughter of Thomas Shaw , wrote a book about the property in 1987 entitled &amp; quot ; Yancannia Creek &amp; quot ; .
The story was of change and apparent progress but also one of environmental degradation .

Land Reform in Developing CountriesLand Reform in Developing Countries : Property Rights and Property Wrongs is a 2009 book by the Leontief Prize – winning economist Michael Lipton .
It is a comprehensive review of land reform issues in developing countries and focuses on the evidence of which land reforms have worked and which have not . The introduction defines land reform as comprising &amp; quot ; laws with the main goal of reducing poverty by substantially increasing the proportion of farmland controlled by the poor , and thereby their income , power or status &amp; quot ; ( the appendix gives a more precise definition ) .
It then expands on what is meant by poverty and how land reform still &amp; quot ; matters &amp; quot ; , especially as according to Lipton &amp; quot ; land is poor people &amp; apos ; s main productive asset &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; at least 1 . 5 billion people today have some farmland as a result of land reform , and are less poor , or not poor , as a result . &amp; quot ; However , for Lipton , &amp; quot ; huge , inefficient land inequalities remain , or have re-emerged , in many low-income countries .
Land reform remains both &amp; apos ; unfinished business &amp; apos ; ( . . . ) and alive and well . &amp; quot ; Chapter 1 analyses the goals of stakeholders involved in land reform : public authorities , landowners , farmers and other directly affected persons as well as the goals for land reform advocated by outsiders , from aid donors to economists and philosophers .
Land reform normally advances one widely shared goal , equality of opportunity , but it can retard another , liberty to enjoy &amp; apos ; legitimate &amp; apos ; property rights .
This chapter looks at the trade-offs and how various types of claimed land reform affect these goals and others , notably poverty reduction , sustainability , economic efficiency and economic growth . Chapter 2 explores the impact of land reform and land policy on farm and non-farm growth and efficiency .
It looks at the long debate on whether &amp; quot ; there is an inverse relationship ( IR ) in labour-abundant countries &amp; quot ; , such that &amp; quot ; small farms produce more , per hectare per year , than large farms &amp; quot ; .
Lipton concludes that careful and recent work in Africa and elsewhere confirms that , &amp; quot ; mainly due to the IR plus land scarcity , redistributive land reform in developing countries normally increases farm output . &amp; quot ; Chapters 3-6 reviews the experience with different types of policies , variously labelled as land reform .
They ask : are these genuine land reforms in the sense of seeking , and moving towards , &amp; quot ; farmland-based reduction of gross , unearned inequality and hence of poverty &amp; quot ; ? These main types of land reform are : Chapter 7 reviews the persistent allegation that land reform is dead , or was so effectively avoided that it never lived .
Lipton asks the questions : Where has it happened on the ground , how much and when ? He also asks : Is land reform still happening and where it is not dead , ought it to be ? Lipton concludes : &amp; quot ; In many developing countries , land reform is a live , often burning , issue . . .
The debate about land reform is alive and well . &amp; quot ; The book overall received positive reviews and endorsements ( see below ) .
However , Andrew Dorward did have some &amp; quot ; minor gripes &amp; quot ; within his very positive review .
He wished that it did not finish so abruptly and that it had a final chapter &amp; quot ; summing up the main lessons from the book for the next generation of researchers , analysts and practitioners in the field . &amp; quot ; He would also have liked to have seen &amp; quot ; more explicit attention to interactions of land reform with gender and the environment . &amp; quot ; Abhijit Sen , while giving it an overall positive review , found that : He also finished his review with some further critiques , especially in relation to land reform in India : The book received positive endorsements from a wide range of authors , including Jeffrey Sachs , Nicholas Stern , Amartya Sen , Gordon Conway , Nancy Birdsall , Paul Collier , Akin Adesina and Pramod K .

He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh , taking his diploma on 12 July 1830 , and being admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians , Edinburgh , on 4 October 1836 . Reid was appointed assistant physician in the clinical wards of Edinburgh Infirmary in 1830 ; and in 1831 went to Paris to study .
Returning in 1832 , he was sent , with three other Edinburgh physicians , to Dumfries during the outbreak of cholera there , remaining for several months there . He lived nearby at 8 Hill Place . Reid described the function of the glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve .
He also proved the heart had a double innervation through the vagus and sympathetic nerves . Reid subsequently became a demonstrator in the school of anatomy established at Old Surgeons &amp; apos ; Hall , Edinburgh , and published medical essays .
In 1836 he was appointed lecturer on physiology at the Edinburgh Extra-Academical Medical School , and in 1838 pathologist to the Royal Infirmary , Edinburgh .

Hampton Court astronomical clockHampton Court astronomical clock is a sixteenth-century astronomical clock in Hampton Court Palace . The clock was installed in 1540 on the gatehouse to the inner court at Hampton Court Palace .
It was designed by Nicholas Crazter and made by Nicholas Oursian .
This pre-Copernican and pre-Galilean astronomical clock is still functioning . The clock is in diameter with three separate copper dials revolving at different speeds and displays the following information : The latter information was of great importance to those visiting this Thames-side palace from London , as the preferred method of transport at the time was by barge , and at low water London Bridge created dangerous rapids .
The clock was restored in 1711 by William Herbert .
In 1831 the astronomical dial had been removed , and the mechanism was replaced with that from a clock dating from 1799 from St James &amp; apos ; s Palace .
In 1879 the astronomical dial was found , and Gillett &amp; amp ; Bland manufactured a new clock movement . The clock was fully restored in 2007 and 2008 by the Cumbria Clock Company in Dacre in time for the 500th anniversary of the accession of King Henry VIII .

Leicester University astronomical clockThe Leicester University astronomical clock is a modern astronomical clock at the University of Leicester . The clock was installed in 1989 on the side of the Rattray Lecture Theatre at the University of Leicester .
It was designed and constructed by Allan Mills and Ralph Jefferson . The display is in diameter .
COSMO-RSCOSMO-RS ( short for COnductor like Screening MOdel for Real Solvents ) is a quantum chemistry based equilibrium thermodynamics method with the purpose of predicting chemical potentials µ in liquids . It processes the screening charge density σ on the surface of molecules to calculate the chemical potential µ of each species in solution .
As an initial step a quantum chemical COSMO calculation for all molecules is performed and the results ( e . g .
the screening charge density ) are stored in a database .
In a separate step COSMO-RS uses the stored COSMO results to calculate the chemical potential of the molecules in a liquid solvent or mixture .
The resulting chemical potentials are the basis for other thermodynamic equilibrium properties such as activity coefficients , solubility , partition coefficients , vapor pressure and free energy of solvation .
The method was developed to provide a general prediction method with no need for system specific adjustment . Due to the use of σ from COSMO calculations , COSMO-RS does not require functional group parameters .
Quantum chemical effects like group-group interactions , mesomeric effects and inductive effects also are incorporated into COSMO-RS by this approach . The COSMO-RS method was first published in 1995 by A .
Klamt .
A refined version of COSMO-RS was published in 1998 and is the basis for newer developments and reimplementations . The below description is a simplified overview of the COSMO-RS version published in 1998 . As long as the above assumptions hold , the chemical potential µ in solution can be calculated from the interaction energies of pairwise surface contacts . Within the basic formulation of COSMO-RS , interaction terms depend on the screening charge density σ .
Each molecule and mixture can be represented by the histogram p ( σ ) , the so-called σ-profile .
The σ-profile of a mixture is the weighted sum of the profiles of all its components . Using the interaction energy E ( σ , σ &amp; apos ; ) and the σ-profile of the solvent p ( σ &amp; apos ; ) , the chemical potential µ ( σ ) of a surface piece with screening charge σ is determined as : Due to the fact that µ ( σ ) is present on both sides of the equation , it needs to be solved iteratively . By combining the above equation with p ( σ ) for a solute x , and adding the σ-independent combinatorial and dispersive contributions , the chemical potential for a solute X in a solvent S results in : In analogy to activity coefficient models used in chemical engineering , such as NRTL , UNIQUAC or UNIFAC , the final chemical potential can be split into a combinatorial and a residual ( non ideal ) contribution .
The interaction energies E ( σ , σ &amp; apos ; ) of two surface pieces are the crucial part for the final performance of the method and different formulations are used within the various implementations .
In addition to the liquid phase terms a chemical potential estimate for the ideal gas phase µ has been added to COSMO-RS to enable the prediction of vapor pressure , free energy of solvation and related quantities . The residual part is the sum of three different contributions , where E and E are part of E and µ is added directly to the chemical potential . In the E expression α is an adjustable parameter and σ and σ &amp; apos ; refer to the screening charge densities of the two surface patches in contact .
This term has been labeled &amp; quot ; misfit &amp; quot ; energy , because it results from the mismatch of the charged surface pieces in contact . It represents the Coulomb interaction relative to the state in a perfect conductor .
A molecule in a perfect conductor ( COSMO state ) is perfectly shielded electronically ; each charge on the molecular surface is shielded by a charge of the same size but of opposite sign .
If the conductor is replaced by surface pieces of contacting molecules the screening of the surface will not be perfect any more .
Hence an interaction energy from this misfit of σ on the surface patches will arise . In the E expression σ and σ are the screening charge densities of the hydrogen bond acceptor and donor respectively .
The hydrogen bonding threshold σ and the prefactor c are adjustable parameters .
The max &amp; # 91 ; &amp; # 93 ; and min &amp; # 91 ; &amp; # 93 ; construction ensures that the screening charge densities of the acceptor and donor exceeds the threshold for hydrogen bonding . The COSMO-RS dispersion energy of a solute depends on an element ( k ) specific prefactor γ and the amount of exposed surface A of this element .
It is not part of the interaction energy but enters the chemical potential directly . Though the use of quantum chemistry reduces the need for adjustable parameters , some fitting to experimental data is inevitable .
The basic parameters are α , c , σ as used in the interaction energies , and one general parameter for the effective contact area .
In addition , one adjustable van der Waals parameter γ per element is required . All parameters either are general or element specific , which is a distinctive feature of COSMO-RS as compared to group contribution methods like UNIFAC . &amp; quot ; COSMO-RS : From quantum Chemistry to Fluid Phase Thermodynamics and Drug Design &amp; quot ; , A .

SachuKumari Sachu ( born 1948 ) is a veteran Tamil actress who has acted in more than 500 films in five different languages and a few television serials .
She is a character actress / comedian who has nonchalantly blended into the roles she has portrayed over five decades .
She made her début in film &amp; apos ; s in 1953 in the film at the age of 4 , and has since then been a prominent face on the silver screen .
In Recent times , she has also begun acting in television serials .
In 2012 , Sri Krishna Gana Sabha in Chennai , honoured Kumari Sachu with the Nadaga Soodamani award . Sachu was born into a large family in Mylapore .
Hailing from an orthodox family of musicians , lawyers and teachers , it was not smooth sailing for the young actress , but her talent acted as the decisive factor .
Permission was granted by her lawyer-father .
As she teamed up with her sister for Bharatanatyam recitals , her film career forged ahead . In 1953 , Sachu , then less than four years old , was noticed by director A C Sami ( of &amp; quot ; Velaikkari &amp; quot ; fame ) , who was in the process of casting her sister for a dance number .
Sami cast her in the Bhanumathi-starrer &amp; quot ; Rani &amp; quot ; , and for a scene , she had to cry .
But Sachu just did not know how to cry ! A quiet pinch did the trick .
Then followed the Arignar Anna-scripted &amp; quot ; Sorga Vaasal &amp; quot ; .
As the younger Paro in &amp; quot ; Devadasu &amp; quot ; , her performance was endearing .
The chubby-faced Sachu went on to fill the vacuum left by Baby Saroja . Sachu performed with élan with the legends , be it Bhanumathi , Padmini , Anjali Devi , or Savithri .
The evergreen &amp; quot ; Maya Bazaar &amp; quot ; was her first 100-day film , and in the film , she played the cherubic Kutti Vatsala ( Junior Savithri ) .
Playing the junior version of S Varalakshmi in &amp; quot ; Shyamala &amp; quot ; thrilled her no end since it starred the legendary Thyagaraja Bhagavathar .
She then took a small break during which she spent the interim perfecting her dance , giving recitals and playing sister roles .
Her first film as heroine in &amp; quot ; Veera Thirumagan &amp; quot ; with Anandan was screened in 1961 . She was offered to play the role of a comedian and act as Nagesh &amp; apos ; s pair in the film Kadhalikka Neramillai , This film starred Muthuraman , Nagesh , Kanchana , Rajasree , T .
S .
Balaiah in lead roles .
After success of this film , she was put in comedian &amp; apos ; s role opposite actors like Suruli Rajan , `Thengai &amp; apos ; Srinivasan , Cho Ramaswamy , Thangavelu , M . R . Vasu and M R Radha in many films from 1964 to 1989 .
She , Manorama , Jayalalithaa came together to act in 2 classic comedy films - Galata Kalyanam and Bommalattam .
Her other notable films include Delhi Mapillai , Thenmazhai , Sorgam , Ooty Varai Oravu , Thunaivan , Meenava Nanban . The 1970s saw her taking to the stage , and her first play was PVR &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Neerottam &amp; quot ; , where she played the famous Charu .
She played a dual role in ARS &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; Deviyar Iruvar &amp; quot ; . Since then , Sachu has been lending her talents out and has successfully starred in over 500 films playing varied roles , and has starred alongside veteran actors such as Sivaji Ganesan , M G Ramachandran , Muthuraman , S A Ashokan , Nagesh , Suruli Rajan , Thengai Srinivasan , Thangavelu and M R Radha . The late 1970s and 1980s saw her playing supporting roles in films alongside Rajinikanth , Kamal Hassan , Chiranjeevi , Venkatesh and many others , while she has also played mother and grandmother roles to younger actors such as Vijay , Surya , Karthik Muthuraman , Sakthi Vasu and many others . She moved on to the small screen in the 2000s and has starred in many serials such as &amp; quot ; Manbumigu Mayor &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Costly Mappilay &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Ananda Bhavan &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Dinesh Ganesh &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Veetukku Veedu Looty &amp; quot ; , where she quotes that she had been able to act in roles which she could not in cinema . She is currently acting as Vijayakumar ( actor ) &amp; apos ; s elder sister in Nandini ( TV series ) aired on Sun TV ( India ) A proud moment in Sachu &amp; apos ; s life was when she received the Kalaimamani award from Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in 1991 and the Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha award , which was presented by M S Subbulakshmi .
Also in 2012 , Sri Krishna Gana Sabha in Chennai , honoured Kumari Sachu with the Nadaga Soodamani award .
Eleanor Davies ( poet ) Eleanor Davies ( 1590 – 1652 ) was a prolific writer and prophet , publishing almost 70 pamphlets during her lifetime . The fifth daughter of George Tuchet , eleventh Baron Audley , she was learned in Latin , theology and law .
In 1609 , she married Sir John Davies , by whom she had three children .
In 1625 , she began caring for George Carr , a 13-year-old Scottish boy who was deaf-mute .
While living with Davies , he began to utter prophecies and on 28 July 1625 , Davies herself began prophesying . The same year she published her first pamphlet , &amp; quot ; A Warning to the Dragon and All his Angels &amp; quot ; , which related the Book of Daniel to contemporary political events . John Davies disliked Davies &amp; apos ; prophesying and burned at least one of her manuscripts .
Scholar Diane Watt recounts that she responded &amp; quot ; by dressing in widow &amp; apos ; s weeds and predicting that he would die in less than three years .
One day in December of the following year , she began to weep uncontrollably during dinner , and three days later her husband died . &amp; quot ; In 1627 , Davies married Sir Archibald Douglas , a professional soldier .
He also destroyed her manuscripts . Many of Davies &amp; apos ; s prophecies were based on anagrams .
For instance , she read her own name Eleanor Audelie as &amp; quot ; Reveale O Daniel &amp; quot ; .
Henrietta Maria consulted her during her first pregnancy , although her relationship with the royal family was rocky .
( She had foretold the death of the Duke of Buckingham , to the king &amp; apos ; s displeasure . ) Davies was involved in several legal disputes during her life .
After her first husband &amp; apos ; s death , she lost possession of her home at Englefield for a time , as well as her estate at Pirton .
Later , after smuggling her illegally printed prophecies back into England from Amsterdam , she was arrested and fined £ 3000 and imprisoned .
After her release , she was arrested again and sent to Bedlam for pouring tar over the altar at Lichfield Cathedral .
Later in 1638 she was moved to the Tower , from which she was released in 1640 .
She was arrested twice more for debt and infringement of publishing laws .
Aurora Ljungstedt &amp; quot ; Aurora &amp; quot ; Lovisa Ljungstedt née &amp; quot ; Hjort &amp; quot ; , pseudonym &amp; quot ; Claude Gérard &amp; quot ; ( 2 September 1821 , Karlskrona - 21 February 1908 , Stockholm ) , was a Swedish writer .
She is regarded to be the first crime novel author of her country and has been referred to as Sweden &amp; apos ; s Edgar Allan Poe . She was born as the eldest of four children to major Georg Leonard Hjort ( 1788-1872 ) and Fredrika Elisabeth Alf ( 1792-1877 ) .
In 1846 , she married Samuel Viktor Ljungstedt ( 1820-1904 ) , an official in the prison care bureau , and settled in Stockholm .
She had three children . Ljungstedt displayed talent early on but her mother disapproved of a literary career as unsuitable as this would make her a public person .
After having married , she was free to write with the support of her spouse .
She debuted in the 1840s and wrote anonymously until her pseudonym was unintentionally exposed in the 1870s . Her crime novels were very successful in Sweden and was also translated to French and Danish .
She was inspired by Eugéne Sue and Edward Bulwer and wrote crime novels in the then fashionable sensationalist horror style , often with supernatural phenomena .

1990 British Formula Three ChampionshipThe 1990 British Formula Three season was the 40th season of the British Formula Three Championship , starting on 1 April at Donington Park and ending on 7 October at Silverstone following 17 races . The season was notable for its domination by future Formula One champion Mika Häkkinen and fellow Finn and future F1 driver Mika Salo ; both drove Mugen-Honda-powered Ralt chassis , prepared by West Surrey Racing and Alan Docking Racing respectively .
Häkkinen started the year strongly with three wins from the first four races , but Salo responded with four victories in the next six events to establish an 11-point advantage over his rival .
The 11th round of the series at Snetterton proved a turning point , however , as Salo spun out while leading , allowing Häkkinen to begin a sequence of six wins from the final seven rounds which would allow him to seal the title with two rounds to spare . Häkkinen &amp; apos ; s reward would be a deal to race with the Lotus F1 team in 1991 , although Salo &amp; apos ; s career momentum was ruined by a drunk-driving charge that forced him to move to Japan to further his career .
Other drivers in the field that went on to enjoy success in international motorsport included Christian Fittipaldi , who went on to win the International Formula 3000 championship the following year before enjoying stints in F1 and CART , and future touring car and sportscar driver Peter Kox . 1990 also marked the start of a dominant period for Mugen-Honda engines , which would power each British F3 champion until 2005 with only one exception .
Charles Rickett won the Class B title in a year-old Volkswagen-powered Ralt .
Häkkinen and Salo set identical fastest lap times and were subsequently both awarded an additional point . Class A &amp; quot ; Points in brackets include dropped scores &amp; quot ; – &amp; quot ; only the best 14 of 17 scores count towards the championship &amp; quot ; Class B

Exeter Cathedral astronomical clockThe Exeter Cathedral Astronomical Clock is a fifteenth-century astronomical clock in Exeter Cathedral , England .
It displays the hour of the day , the day of the lunar month and the phase of the moon .
The modern clock mechanism was installed in 1885 by Gillett &amp; amp ; Bland of Croydon , and restored in 1910 . The clock is thought to date from around 1484 . The outermost disc is decorated with a fleur-de-lis which represents the sun , and which orbits the dial once every 24 hours .
This indicates the hour of the day , counted from I to XII in Roman numerals in first the right and then the left hemispheres of the clockface .
This is an example of a 24-hour analog dial .
The tail of the sun &amp; apos ; s fleur-de-lis points to the day in the lunar month on the inner ring .
The half-black , half-silver moon inside the lunar month ring rotates on its axis to show the correct phase of the moon .
The earth is represented as a fixed golden ball in the centre of the dial .
The Latin inscription &amp; quot ; Pereunt et imputantur &amp; quot ; below the main dial may be translated as &amp; quot ; The hours pass and are reckoned to our account &amp; quot ; . A small bell located behind the clock dial chimes the quarter-hours .
On the hour , this is followed by the striking of the Peter Bell in the tower above . In 1759 the smaller upper dial was added with a single hand to indicate the minutes . The clock-room is behind the dial on the north wall of the transept , and still houses the clock mechanism .
Access is via a doorway visible in the stone wall directly beneath the clock .
Legend suggests that the round hole cut in the bottom of the door was for the cathedral cat to gain entry to keep the clock clear of mice and rats .
The modern clock mechanism was installed in 1885 by Gillett &amp; amp ; Bland of Croydon . The clock was restored in 1910 by John James Hall FRAS . The clock is reputed to be the source of the nursery rhyme Hickory Dickory Dock , probably inspired by the round hole in the door described above .
Valērijs ŠabalaValērijs Šabala ( born 12 October 1994 ) is a Latvian football striker , who plays for Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała and the Latvian national football team . As a youth player Šabala was a member of Daugava Rīga academy .
With the club winning the 2008 Latvian First League and being promoted to the Latvian Higher League for the 2009 season , Šabala was one of the youngsters to be included in the first team squad by the manager Vladimirs Beļajevs .
Šabala made his debut on 15 October 2009 , having just turned 15 , when he came on as a substitute in the 46th minute in an 8 – 0 loss against the defending champions FK Ventspils .
Three days later he appeared in the match against FC Tranzit , coming on as a substitute in the 88th minute .
Daugava Rīga were relegated to the Latvian First League and Šabala joined the Latvian Higher League new-comers JFK Olimps in January 2010 .
Šabala scored his first Latvian Higher League goal on 23 April 2010 in a match against Skonto Riga .
At the time he was 15 years and 193 days old , which made him the youngest ever goalscorer in the history of Latvian championship and all the top tier European football leagues .
His record was broken on 10 June 2014 , when Skonto Riga midfielder Jānis Grīnbergs scored a penalty against Daugava Daugavpils being just 15 years and 102 days old .
All in all that season Šabala played 21 league matches and scored 6 goals . In February 2011 Šabala joined that time Latvian Higher League champions Skonto Riga .
In his debut season with the club he was rarely used in the first eleven and often came on as a substitute , scoring 2 goals in 22 matches .
Šabala scored his first league goal for Skonto on 25 September 2011 against his former club JFK Olimps .
Despite the limited playing time , he was named &amp; quot ; Young player of the year &amp; quot ; and received the Ilmārs Liepiņš prize .
Throughout the season Šabala went on short term trials with Arsenal , Watford and Udinese Calcio . In January 2012 Šabala went on trial with the Ukrainian Premier League club Dynamo Kyiv alongside his international teammate Vitālijs Jagodinskis , but eventually returned to Skonto with only the latter one signing a contract .
On 30 June 2012 Šabala scored his first hat-trick in a league match against FS Metta / LU being just 17 years 8 months and 18 days old .
On 10 July he was named the best Latvian Higher League player in June .
In September Šabala went on trial with the Russian Premier League club CSKA Moscow and played in their friendly match against Lokomotiv-2 Moscow .
In November information appeared in the media that CSKA Moscow were ready to offer Skonto 3 . 5 million euros for the player , but eventually the move did not occur .
Šabala finished the 2012 season as the 5th top scorer of the league with 11 goals .
In December he received the Ilmārs Liepiņš prize as the &amp; quot ; Young player of the year &amp; quot ; for the second season in a row . In the 2013 season Šabala scored 15 league goals , coming one goal short to his teammate Artūrs Karašausks and Daugava Daugavpils player Andrejs Kovaļovs , who both became the top scorers of the league with 16 goals each .
On 18 July Šabala helped Skonto beat the Czech club Slovan Liberec 2 – 1 at home in the UEFA Europa League 2nd round qualification match , scoring the first goal .
He was included in the LFF and &amp; quot ; sportacentrs . com &amp; quot ; Latvian Higher League Team of the Tournament and named the best forward of the season .
Skonto confirmed having received concrete offers for the player from the Turkish Süper Lig club Trabzonspor , Italian Serie A club Hellas Verona and Belgian Pro League club Club Brugge . On 29 January 2014 Šabala joined the Belgian Pro League club Club Brugge , signing a contract till 30 June 2018 .
In order to get immediate playing time he was loaned back to Skonto till 1 July 2014 .
During the loan spell Šabala appeared in 9 league matches and scored 5 goals .
Having spent the pre-season preparation period with Club Brugge , Šabala was given out on another loan to the Cypriot First Division club Anorthosis Famagusta on 22 August 2014 . After loan stints in Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia and Latvia , on August 4 , 2017 Šabala signed a two-year contract with I liga side Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała . Šabala was a member of all international youth teams and made his debut for the Latvia national football team on 24 May 2013 in a friendly match against Qatar .
In the next match he scored his first goals for the national team , scoring twice in a friendly against Turkey , becoming the youngest ever international goal scorer for Latvia .
His first official qualifier match was the 2014 World Cup qualifying match against Bosnia and Herzegovina .

Finney Isles &amp; amp ; amp ; Co BuildingFinney Isles &amp; amp ; Co Building is a heritage-listed department store at 196 Queen Street , Brisbane CBD , City of Brisbane , Queensland , Australia .
It was designed by Claude William Chambers and built from 1909 to 1910 by James Mason .
It was also known as David Jones . In 1992 the building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register ; at that time , the building was occupied by David Jones Limited which had taken over Finney Isles &amp; amp ; Co in the 1960s . This department store complex was built in stages between 1909 and 1936 for the firm of Finney Isles &amp; amp ; Co .
The firm was established by Thomas Finney and James Isles in 1864 with a draper &amp; apos ; s store in Fortitude Valley .
The business quickly expanded , occupying Queen Street premises in the 1870s , then the City Exchange building in Edward &amp; amp ; Adelaide Streets from the mid 1880s in which it sold a wide range of clothing , furniture and household items .
Finney Isles , like many retailing firms , had a manufacturing section making both clothing and furniture . New premises , which were called the &amp; quot ; Big Block &amp; quot ; , were erected for the company in 1909-1910 .
Designed by C W Chambers with J Mason the contractor , the building comprised five floors on Queen Street and three floors on Adelaide Street .
The use of reinforced concrete for structural purposes was one of the first occasions in Queensland .
The Adelaide Street site was previously occupied by the Gaiety Theatre and part of its southern wall was incorporated in the new structure .
The building featured innovative display windows on Queen Street , silky oak staircases , lifts decorated in latticed ironwork and silky oak , pneumatic tubes for exchanging cash , a roof-top water tower and a large generator providing electricity to the lights , lifts , pneumatic system and the 400 sewing machines in the workrooms . In 1921 the company acquired a two storeyed building adjoining the northern side of the Queen Street store and it was converted for use as the men &amp; apos ; s department .
In 1929 this building was extended to four storeys and the facade remodelled to a similar style of the 1909 store . The complex was further extended in 1936 when a three storeyed building was erected on the southern side of the Adelaide Street store .
Designed by the firm of Atkinson and Conrad , the work was undertaken by Stuart Bros Ltd . Additional floors and a screen were added to the 1929 Queen Street building after 1949 and the 1936 Adelaide Street building was extended to five storeys prior to 1962 .
Finney Isles &amp; amp ; Co was taken over by David Jones in the 1960s . The building with frontages to Queen and Adelaide Streets , comprises four main sections of varying levels and differing facade treatment . The southern Queen Street section ( 1909 ) has six storeys with a basement .
The facade contains five vertical bays of windows , now painted , above the ground floor level .
The bays are divided by a cluster of slender columns and mouldings extending into delicate floral decoration at their top .
The cornice is elaborately decorated with egg and dart moulding , and rows of rosettes on the soffit and face .
The words , &amp; quot ; THE BIG BLOCK &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; FINNEY ISLES &amp; amp ; CO .
LIMITED &amp; quot ; are contained on the parapet in raised lettering .
Above the parapet is a central raised classical pediment containing the date &amp; quot ; A1909D &amp; quot ; .
A concrete and glass overhead walkway that spans from the building to the opposite side of the Queen Street Mall intrudes into the facade at the first floor level . The northern Queen Street section ( 1929 with extensions in 1949 ) is of six levels .
The facade comprises a perforated steel screen masking an earlier facade . The northern Adelaide Street section ( 1909 ) comprises three storeys .
The facade is more austere than that of Queen Street , reflecting the lesser importance of this street address .
Originally having five distinct bays , half of the far right bay has been removed in the construction of the neighbouring section .
The upper level windows have broad arched openings that are visually connected to the square headed windows below by plain flanking pilasters .
The windows have been painted .
Above these at parapet level is a central triangular pediment incorporating the date &amp; quot ; A 1909 D &amp; quot ; . The southern Adelaide Street section ( 1936 ) comprises six storeys .
The facade , in the Art Deco style , consists of three bays of four windows separated by pilasters .
The art deco treatment returns for some distance along the southern wall .
The windows , now painted , are all small , slender rectangular openings .
Decorative friezes occur between the pilasters at each change in level , and again on the parapet . The shopfronts at both Adelaide Street and Queen Streets contain modern glazing , finishes and fittings . Internally the store has been substantially changed .
Part of the original ceiling is visible at the front of the 1909 Queen Street section on the upper level .
On the first floor of the Adelaide Street section the ceiling is also substantially intact .
The 1930s Adelaide Street section retains much of its Art Deco detailing , particularly evident is the black and white Rockhampton marble around the lift wells . The building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria . The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places . The building demonstrates the principal characteristics of a larger scale and early 20th century department store and forms part of streetscape consisting of a group of complementary buildings including the nearby National Australia Bank and Prouds buildings . The place is important because of its aesthetic significance . The building exhibits important aesthetic characteristics valued by the community , in particular the finely articulated 1909 Queen Street facade , the disciplined 1936 art deco facade and the building &amp; apos ; s contribution to the Queen and Adelaide streetscapes . The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person , group or organisation of importance in Queensland &amp; amp ; apos ; s history . The building has a special association with the life and work of Thomas Finney and James Isles , and with their firm , Finney Isles &amp; amp ; Co , a major Queensland department store .
1981 PBA Reinforced Filipino Conference FinalsThe 1981 PBA Reinforced Filipino Conference Finals was the best-of-5 basketball championship series of the 1981 PBA Reinforced Filipino Conference , and the conclusion of the conference &amp; apos ; s playoffs . The Crispa Redmanizers captured their 9th PBA title with a 3 – 1 series win against the U / Tex Wranglers . The Redmanizers outscored the Wranglers , 33 – 18 in the second quarter to take a 62 – 45 lead at halftime .
Crispa kept U / Tex at a 15-point distance in the first seven minutes of play in the third period before Bogs Adornado and Lim Eng Beng scored successively from the field to get the Wranglers to within seven points , 73 – 80 .
The Wranglers threaten once more in the final quarter with Leroy Jackson , Adornado and Lim combined for 26 points but Abet Guidaben scored twice to stop their rally as Crispa leads , 110 – 99 .
U / Tex kept on fighting back with a 9-2 run , Allan Green &amp; apos ; s basket was countered by a three-point goal from Ricky Pineda to trim the lead further at 108 – 112 , luckily for the Redmanizers , time has run out on U / Tex , Green made a charity from Jackson &amp; apos ; s backcourt foul for the final count . The Wranglers trailed for most part of the first half , reversed the trend in the second half and even led by eight points , 89 – 81 , Freddie Hubalde spark a rally for Crispa that tied the count for the last time at 91 – all , Wranglers &amp; apos ; import Leroy Jackson came up with the key points in the last two minutes of play , after he put U / Tex back on top , Hubalde missed tying the game when he muffed an easy layup , Jackson scored on a fastbreak hit that iced the game for U / Tex with 10 seconds left . Allan Green , coming out of the bench in the last four minutes , tallied two three-point plays against Leroy Jackson to give Crispa a 114 – 108 margin , the Wranglers fell behind by 14 points in the first half and 13 in the final period .
Bogs Adornado shot the last six of his 34 points in a U / Tex rally that cut down Crispa &amp; apos ; s lead to two , 101 – 103 .
It was then when Green made the first of his three-point plays .
A 23-10 run by Crispa in the second quarter with Atoy Co catching fire , gave them leads by 15 points , 52 – 37 , the Wranglers fought back to within eight points at halftime , 55 – 63 .
The Redmanizers had entered penalty situation midway in the third quarter , Leroy Jackson got away with 16 points , 10 of which came from the foul line , coach Baby Dalupan was so mad at the way officiating was going that he yelled at the referees during a U / Tex timeout .
Crispa led by only one , 91 – 90 , at the end of the first 36 minutes of play .
In the final quarter , the Wranglers , starring Jackson and Jimmy Noblezada , grabbed the lead and held it several times , the last at 105 – 103 , gutsy plays gave the Redmanizers a 109 – 106 lead before Philip Cezar made a clever move that caused Adornado to charge into him for an offensive foul and Adornado &amp; apos ; s sixth foul to bowed out in the ballgame , a 7 – 4 burst gave Crispa a comfortable 119 – 114 edge with less than two minutes remaining .

John HeyshamJohn Heysham M . D .
( 1753 – 1834 ) was an English physician , now remembered as a statistician . Born at Lancaster on 22 November 1753 , he was the son of John Heysham , shipowner , by Anne Cumming , the daughter of a Westmoreland farmer .
He was educated at a school kept by Quakers at Yealand , near Burton , Westmorland , and then apprenticed for five years to a surgeon at Burton .
In 1774 he joined the medical classes at Edinburgh , and graduated M . D .
in 1777 . In 1778 Heysham settled in practice at Carlisle , Cumberland and resided there until his death on 23 March 1834 .
He was buried in St .
Mary &amp; apos ; s Church , and a memorial window was placed at the east end of the south aisle of the cathedral . Heysham &amp; apos ; s practice was a modest financial success .
With the help of the dean and chapter he established the first dispensary for the poor at Carlisle .
A strong Tory and supporter of the Lonsdale family most of his life , he joined the reform movement in 1832 .
A biography was written by Henry Lonsdale . Heysham &amp; apos ; s thesis was &amp; quot ; De rabie canina &amp; quot ; .
He published also &amp; quot ; An Account of the Jail Fever at Carlisle in 1781 &amp; quot ; ( London , 1782 ) . In 1779 Heysham began a series of statistical observations , by which he is now best known .
They comprised a record of the annual births , marriages , diseases , and deaths in Carlisle for ten years ( to 1788 ) , including a census of the inhabitants in 1780 , and again in 1788 .
These statistics , which were published with remarks on them at Carlisle in 1797 , were used in 1815 by Joshua Milne , actuary of the Sun Life Assurance Office , as the basis of a well-known life table , the &amp; quot ; Carlisle Table &amp; quot ; .
It appeared in Milne &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Treatise on the Valuation of Annuities and Assurances on Lives and Survivorships &amp; quot ; vol .
I .
The table was still relied upon in 1851 , for the Institute of Actuaries benchmark published by Peter Gray , William Orchard and Henry Ambrose Smith .
The Institute &amp; apos ; s revision of 1870 caused the obsolescence of the table . Heysham was also a naturalist , his observations on the flora and fauna of his district being recorded in William Hutchinson &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; History of the County of Cumberland &amp; quot ; .
He was close to the Carlisle Cathedral chapter , and was thought to have assisted Archdeacon William Paley on questions of design in nature .

Renshaw ministryThe Renshaw ministry was the 61st ministry of the New South Wales Government , and was led by the 31st Premier , the Honourable Jack Renshaw , MLA , of the Australian Labor Party .
The ministry was the only occasion when the Government was led by Renshaw , as Premier . Renshaw was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1941 and served continuously until 1980 , representing the seat of Castlereagh .
Having served as the Secretary for Lands in the third McGirr ministry , Renshaw was promoted as the Secretary for Public Works and Minister for Local Government in the first and second Cahill ministries .
He then served as the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Highways in the third and fourth Cahill ministries .
When Bob Heffron became Premier in 1959 , Renshaw was elected as his Deputy , serving variously as the Treasurer , the Minister for Lands , the Minister for Agriculture , and the Minister for Industrial Development and Decentralisation in the first and second Heffron ministries .
When Heffron resigned as Labor Leader in April 1964 , Renshaw was elected to lead Labor and became Premier . This ministry covers the period from 30 April 1964 until 13 May 1965 , when the Renshaw-led Labor Government was defeated at the 1965 state election by the Liberal-Country coalition led by Robert Askin and Charles Cutler ; ending twenty-four consecutive years of Labor government in New South Wales under William McKell , McGirr , Cahill , Heffron and Renshaw . The composition of the ministry was announced by Premier Renshaw following his appointment as Premier on 30 April 1964 , and covers the period until 13 May 1965 , when Renshaw &amp; apos ; s Labor-led government was defeated .
Ministers are listed in order of seniority and in all cases , serve the full term of this ministry .
Metal carbonyl clusterIn chemistry , a metal carbonyl cluster is a compound that contains two or more metals linked in part by metal-metal bonds and containing carbon monoxide ( CO ) as the exclusive or predominant ligand .
Simple examples include Fe ( CO ) , Fe ( CO ) , Mn ( CO ) .
High nuclearity clusters include &amp; # 91 ; Rh ( CO ) H &amp; # 93 ; and the stacked Pt triangules &amp; # 91 ; Pt ( CO ) &amp; # 93 ; ( n = 2 – 6 ) . Binary carbonyl clusters consist only of metal and CO .
They are the most widely studied and used metal carbonyl clusters .
They arise in general by the condensation of unsaturated metal carbonyls .
Dissociation of CO from Ru ( CO ) would give Ru ( CO ) , which could trimerize to Ru ( CO ) .
The reaction mechanisms are more complicated than this simple scenario .
Condensation of low molecular weight metal carbonyls requires decarbonylation , which can be induced thermally , photochemically , or using various reagents .
The nuclearity ( number of metal centers ) of binary metal carbonyl clusters is usually no greater than six . Chini clusters follow the general formula of &amp; # 91 ; Pt ( CO ) &amp; # 93 ; , 1 &amp; lt ; n &amp; lt ; 10 .
These clusters are prepared by reduction of hexachloroplatinate with strongly basic methanol under an atmosphere of CO .
These clusters consist of stacks of triangularly shaped Pt3 subunits .
Although these clusters were first reported in 1969 by Chatt and Booth , their structure were not established until Chini and Longoni ’ s work in 1976 . Chini clusters are based on a planar triangular building block that can be condensed as multiple units forming chains usually anywhere from two to ten units long .
The chains are formed by stacking of the planar units , extending through platinum to platinum bonds forming trigonal prismatic clusters .
Within a triangular unit , the platinum-platinum bond lengths are 2 . 65 Å and between units the Pt---Pt bond lengths are 3 . 05 Å .
Cluster structure is easily disrupted by deposition onto surfaces such as carbon or silicon , where the chains are broken , but the triangular subunits remain intact .
The tetramer &amp; # 91 ; Pt ( CO ) &amp; # 93 ; is the most common member of this series of clusters .
These clusters undergo reversible redox .
They catalyze the hydrogenation of alkenes , ketones , aldehydes . Chini clusters can also be converted heterometal clusters and catalyze pH driven redox reactions and transport .
First , the Chini clusters are the source of platinum atoms for the mixed metal cluster synthesis .
For instance , the reaction &amp; # 91 ; Pt ( CO ) &amp; # 93 ; with &amp; # 91 ; Ag ( PPh ) &amp; # 93 ; produces heterometal cluster &amp; # 91 ; PtAg ( CO ) ( PPh ) &amp; # 93 ; .
Second , the Chini clusters with redox properties act as a catalyst that helps transport sodium ions and electrons in the same direction across a liquid membrane , driven by pH-gradient .
The &amp; # 91 ; Pt ( CO ) &amp; # 93 ; platinum clusters , where n = 4 – 6 , are reduced by HO- . ( n-1 ) &amp; # 91 ; Pt ( CO ) &amp; # 93 ; + 2OH ↔ n &amp; # 91 ; Pt ( CO ) &amp; # 93 ; + HO + 1 / 2OAlthough the nuclearity of binary metal carbonyl clusters is usually six or fewer , carbido clusters often have higher nuclearities .
Metal carbonyls of the iron and cobalt triads are well known to form carbido derivatives .
Examples include &amp; # 91 ; RhC ( CO ) &amp; # 93 ; and &amp; # 91 ; RuC ( CO ) &amp; # 93 ; .
Carbonyl carbides exist not only with fully encapsulated carbon ( e . g . , &amp; # 91 ; FeC ( CO ) &amp; # 93 ; ) but also with exposed carbon centres as in FeC ( CO ) and FeC ( CO ) . For low nuclearity clusters , bonding is often described as if it is localized .
For this purpose , the eighteen electron rule is used .
Thus , 34 electrons in an organometallic complex predicts a dimetallic complex with a metal-metal bond .
For higher nuclearity clusters , more elaborate rules are invoked including Jemmis mno rules and Polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory . Although clusters are often written with discrete M-M bonds , the nature of this bonding is unclear , especially when there are bridging ligands .
Wimborne Minster astronomical clockWimborne Minster astronomical clock is a fourteenth-century astronomical clock in Wimborne Minster , regarded as &amp; quot ; one of the most ancient working clocks in Europe . &amp; quot ; The clock dates back to the early fourteenth century , possibly around 1320 .
It is suggested that it was built by Peter Lightfoot , a Glastonbury monk The clock &amp; apos ; s case was built in the Elizabethan era , but the face and dial are of a much greater age ; the first documents relating to the clock concern repairs carried out in 1409 .
In early church records the clock is referred to as the &amp; quot ; oryall &amp; quot ; . In 1593 , the clock was removed from the central tower , and moved to its current location in the minster &amp; apos ; s west tower .
The clock &amp; apos ; s mechanism was replaced in 1695 and the present works were installed in 1792 .
The gilded angels and cherubim which adorn the case , were transplanted from the original organ case during church renovations undertaken in the Victorian era .
In 1979 restorations were carried out upon the clock which reproduced the simple designs discovered under the ancient layers of paint . The display on the clock is based upon the geocentric model , which was not superseded until the advent of heliocentrism in the late 16th century .
The earth is represented by a green sphere positioned in the centre of the clock face .
The sun points to the hour of day .
The gold / black orb represents the moon , and shows the lunar phases .
At full moon , it is golden and at new moon it is black .
For intermediate phases it is partially black and gold in proportion to the phase . The casing on the wall contains cogs which move the sun and moon around the face of the clock .
The movement is in the belfry .
On the outside north wall of the minster is a full size Grenadier , called the Quarterjack , which strikes the quarter hours .
The original figure of a monk was replaced during the Napoleonic Wars .

He finished out his career with the Americans in 2017 .
Piva AirfieldPiva Airfield is a former World War II airfield on Bougainville Island in the Solomon Islands archipelago . The 3rd Marine Division landed on Bougainville on 1 November 1943 at the start of the Bougainville Campaign , establishing a beachhead around Cape Torokina .
Small detachments of the 25th , 53rd , 71st and 75th Naval Construction Battalions landed with the Marines and the 71st Battalion was tasked with establishing a small fighter airfield that would become Torokina Airfield . On 26 November 1943 the 36th Naval Construction Battalion arrived on Bouganville and on 29 November they started work on a by bomber strip .
The first plane landed on the bomber strip on 19 December and it was put into operation on 30 December , after several weeks of operation it was extended by an additional .
The 71st Battalion built three taxiways with 35 hardstands , a shop area , seven nose hangars , three prefabricated steel huts , and 26 frame buildings .
Aviation camps consisted of a 5,000-man camp for Marine Air Group 24 .
The 77th Battalion arrived on Bougainville on 10 December 1943 and began constructing a fighter airfield parallel to the bomber field .
The airfield was completed on 3 January and the first plane landed on 9 January .
Several weeks later , the 77th Battalion was instructed to extend the strip by .
Both airfields were connected by taxiways and shared fuel tank farms and other facilities .
The construction of the airfields frequently took place under Japanese harassing fire as the US forces never sought to occupy the entire island . The bomber airfield became known as Piva 1 , Piva North Airfield , Piva Uncle Airfield or Piva Bomber Strip while the fighter airfield became known as Piva 2 , Piva South Airfield , Piva Yoke Airfield or Piva Fighter Strip . US Navy units based at Piva included : USMC units based at Piva included : RAAF units based at Piva included : RNZAF units based at Piva included : On 30 January 1944 an F4U of VF-17 collided with an FG1 of VMF-211 over Piva Bomber Strip , both planes were destroyed and both pilots killed . On 8 March 1944 Japanese artillery opened up on Piva Airfield and destroyed one B-24 Liberator and three fighters and damaged nineteen other aircraft .

St .
Jerome in the Wilderness ( Dürer ) St .
Jerome in the Wilderness is a double-sided oil on panel painting by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer , executed around 1496 , now in the National Gallery in London , where both sides are displayed . The work was attributed to Dürer in 1957 , basing on the resemblance between the lion and a similar animal on a membrane drawing from the artist &amp; apos ; s second trip to Venice , now at the Hamburger Kunsthalle .
The lion was almost surely drawn from St .
Mark &amp; apos ; s Lion depictions in the city . The painting was previously in the Fitzwilliam Museum of Cambridge , and was later bought by the London museum . St .
Jerome was a common subject of art at the time .
Dürer for this works was probably inspired by similar depictions by Giovanni Bellini , or other artists influenced by Andrea Mantegna . Jerome is portrayed during his hermitage , surrounded by all the symbols traditionally attributed to him : the tamed lion , the hat and the cardinal garments on the ground ( a symbol of rejection of earthly honors ) , the book ( Jerome was a translator of the Vulgate ) , the stone he used to hit himself , and the crucifix for the prayers . The depiction of nature is typical of Northern European art , with numerous details such as the small birds , the white butterfly in the lower part , as well as the fine rendering of the trunk &amp; apos ; s bark or the depiction of grass spear by spear .
The sky in the background is similar to Dürer &amp; apos ; s watercolor of the &amp; quot ; Pool in the Wood &amp; quot ; , now in the British Museum . On the reverse of this painting is an intriguing image of what appears to be a meteor / meteorite or comet .
Dürer &amp; apos ; s inspiration may have been the depictions of comets in the &amp; quot ; Nuremberg Chronicle &amp; quot ; of 1493 .
However , those woodcuts are highly stylized , and are not intended to show historical comets , whereas Dürer &amp; apos ; s image has the feel of an actual observation , as does the blazing star in Dürer &amp; apos ; s enigmatic engraving &amp; quot ; Melencolia I &amp; quot ; , published in 1514 . If Dürer &amp; apos ; s images do represent actual celestial objects , then there are three possible candidates .
The first is the Comet of 1491 .
Dr Sten Odenwald said that it &amp; quot ; allegedly came to within 0 . 0094 AU on 1491 Feb .
20 . 0 TT , but the orbit of this comet is very uncertain &amp; quot ; ; NASA &amp; apos ; s website agrees with Odenwald &amp; apos ; s comment on the orbit .
The second is the Ensisheim meteorite .
This was suggested by Ursula B Marvin ( &amp; apos ; The meteorite of Ensisheim – 1492 to 1992 &amp; apos ; , ( 1992 ) ) , in relation to &amp; quot ; Melencolia I &amp; quot ; .
This object fell in Alsace on 7 November 1492 .
The third is the comet of 1493 , mentioned in the chronological section of Sir David Brewster &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; The Edinburgh Encyclopædia &amp; quot ; , which said it was : &amp; quot ; seen before and after passing its meridian . &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ;

Gunfire ( drink ) Gunfire ( or gun-fire ) is a British cocktail made of black tea and rum .
It has its origins in the British Army and is also used as a name for early morning tea in the army . It is unknown when gunfire was concocted , but it is known that it was mixed by British Army soldiers during the 1890s .
Gunfire is served by officers and non-commissioned officers to lower ranks before a morning attack ( as a form of Dutch courage ) and as a celebration before a Passing out parade .
It is also traditionally served to soldiers in their beds by their officers on Christmas Day at reveille if they are deployed over Christmas . Individual regiments may carry out the ritual on other days : for example , in the Royal Tank Regiment gunfire is served on Cambrai Day ; in the Queen &amp; apos ; s Royal Hussars on Balaclava Day and Saint Patrick &amp; apos ; s Day ; and in the Regimental traditions gunfire made with whiskey on St Patrick &amp; apos ; s Day . During the Korean War , members of the American Military Police Corps were given gunfire by British soldiers under the guise of it being normal tea after a recovery mission .
This led to intoxication of the MPs who then drove an armoured recovery vehicle and some army jeeps into a camp gate as a result . In Australia and New Zealand on ANZAC Day , a version of gunfire with black coffee instead of tea is served to soldiers before dawn services as part of the &amp; quot ; gunfire breakfast &amp; quot ; . Gunfire has also been made and drunk outside of military circles .
Gunfire was served to participants of British reality programme , Bad Lads Army by the non-commissioned officers before their passing out parade , mirroring the same procedure in the British Army . Gunfire is also drunk by Australian civilians to commemorate ANZAC Day . A similar drink , particularly in the German-speaking world is Jagertee . Gunfire consists of one cup of black tea with one shot of rum , which is then stirred in the cup .

Toned milkToned milk is a method , developed in India , of treating buffalo milk by adding skim milk , powdered skim milk and water to buffalo milk .
This process decreases the fat content , increases the quantity of available milk , and &amp; apos ; tones up &amp; apos ; the non-fat solids level to the original amount .
The cost of the milk is reduced , making it more widely available and not a luxury purchase .
Toned milk is often used in areas where milk production is extremely low .
In these cases , untreated milk tends to be high in fat , and mechanical removal of the milk-fat would be cost-prohibitive . Buffalo milk has a fat content of about 7-8 % , and contains calcium and a non-fat solids content of 9-10 % .
By reducing the fat content to 3 % through the toning process , the available milk quantity is nearly tripled .
Double-toned milk is a similar product , where the fat content of the milk is reduced to 1 . 5 % and the non-fat solids content increased to 9 % .
This product is produced by UNICEF for free distribution to homeless youth and low-income families .
Unlike single toned milk , double-toned milk is always pasteurized .

Such provisos allow the state whose assistance has been requested ( &amp; quot ; the requested party &amp; quot ; ) to refuse to hand over a suspect to — or to gather evidence on behalf of — another state ( &amp; quot ; the requesting party &amp; quot ; ) , if the requested party &amp; apos ; s competent authority determines that the requesting party seeks assistance in order to prosecute an offence of a political character . The concept of an exception for political offences is a very new idea compared to the concept of extradition itself , and indeed constitutes an almost complete reversal of the original purpose of extradition .
The earliest treaties for handing over criminal suspects from one country to another , dating from the 13th century BC , were aimed exclusively at fugitives who had committed political or religious crimes .
Sovereigns made little effort towards the recapture of common criminals who had fled their jurisdiction , but actively pursued political criminals , to the extent of requesting aid from other sovereigns . After the French Revolution , international attitudes towards the extradition of political offenders began a slow shift .
In 1833 , Belgium became the first country to legislate a prohibition against the extradition of political offenders ( section 6 of the &amp; quot ; Loi du 1 octobre 1833 sur les extraditions &amp; quot ; ) , and included such a prohibition in its extradition treaty with France the following year .
France itself began including such exceptions in its extradition treaties with various other countries over the several decades that followed .
France began to include the political offence exception in its treaties later that year ; the United States followed suit starting in 1843 , and England in 1852 .
Belgium , as the first country to codify a political offence exception to extradition , was also a pioneer in efforts to define the outer limits of what exactly constitutes a &amp; quot ; political offence &amp; quot ; .
In what is now known as the &amp; quot ; clause d &amp; apos ; attentat &amp; quot ; or the &amp; quot ; clause Belge &amp; quot ; , Belgium excluded from the definition of &amp; quot ; political offence &amp; quot ; crimes committed against the life of a head of state or head of government after having to refuse to extradite two persons who attempted to assassinate Napoleon III . Throughout the twentieth century , world events forced governments to examine the concept of the political offence exception more closely , first in the 1920s and 1930s as clashing fascists and communists used methods that could be described in modern parlance as terrorism to promote their respective political aims , then after World War II as both war criminals and collaborators with occupation governments sought with much success to protect themselves behind the shield of political offence exceptions , and further into the 1960s and 1970s with members of national liberation and anti-colonialist movements whose proponents acclaimed them as freedom fighters while detractors labelled them terrorists .
The result was an increasingly common limitation , in addition to the &amp; quot ; clause Belge &amp; quot ; , that acts prohibited by multilateral treaties are not subject to the political offence exception . Various international conventions attempted to exclude consideration of motivation for certain crimes , with mixed success .
The Hague Hijacking Convention of 1970 was an early example of this .
It sought to correct the failure of the earlier Tokyo Convention to mandate prosecution or extradition for aircraft hijacking .
Though the Hague Convention did not explicitly force signatories to exclude aircraft hijacking as a political offence , as it was believed at the time that this would inhibit the adoption of the Convention , it was a step in the direction towards promoting uniform international practice .
China does not apply the principle of non-extradition for political offences in case of crimes of aircraft hijacking and other offences against civil aviation safety .
The United States regards the Hague Hijacking Convention as &amp; quot ; forbidding any inquiry &amp; quot ; into an offender &amp; apos ; s political motivation .
An early draft of the 1973 Protection of Diplomats Convention attempted to take a stronger step in prohibiting consideration of an alleged offender &amp; apos ; s motives , but this language was deleted from the final version of the treaty . The 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism was more successful at limiting the scope of the political offence exception ; in its first article , it provided a long list of offences which could not be regarded as political offences , including not just the traditional &amp; quot ; clause d &amp; apos ; attentat &amp; quot ; , but also kidnapping , hostage taking , and the use of bombs and firearms where the use endangered lives .
Article 13 permits contracting states to register reservations to Article 1 and thus to preserve their domestic law political offence exceptions , but , for example , the United Kingdom elected not to do so .
Article 11 of the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings also provided that offences covered by that convention could not be regarded as political offences for the purpose of refusing an extradition request .
The 2004 implementation of the European Arrest Warrant system entirely removed the political offence exception to extradition among member states of the European Union . Political offences have been divided into two groups .
Absolute or pure political offences are offences which are directed against the political organization or government of the state and contain no element of a common crime at all .
Pure political offences include crimes such as treason , espionage , and sedition .
In most cases , there is no duty to extradite for pure political offences , and there is agreement that the political offence exception applies to these offences . More difficult is the situation of a relative political offence in which a common crime is committed in connection with a political act .
Several different legal tests have been developed to determine when the political offence exception applies . The political incidence test looks to whether the offence is &amp; quot ; part of and incidental to a political struggle &amp; quot ; .
Initially , it did not concern itself with the motives of the offender .
English courts first developed this test in the 1891 case &amp; quot ; In re Castolini &amp; quot ; , in which Switzerland sought the extradition of a man from Bellinzona who had shot dead a government official during political unrest there .
The Extradition Act 1870 provided in general language for an exception to extradition for offences of a political character or offences for which extradition is sought to punish the offender for a political action , but the Act did not define those terms in detail .
Judge George Denman formulated the two legs of the test for offences of a political character : first that the offence occurred during a political disturbance , and second that the offence was an overt act part of or incidental to the disturbance , and so ruled that Castolini could not be extradited . Later cases looked to the motives of the offender in an effort to determine whether the offences could fall under a more liberal definition of &amp; quot ; political disturbance &amp; quot ; .
In the 1954 case &amp; quot ; Ex parte Kolczynski &amp; quot ; , English courts first extended the political incidence test to events that were not part of political unrest : a revolt by seven Polish sailors who mutinied against their captain and took their ship to the United Kingdom .
Judges James Cassels and Rayner Goddard interpreted &amp; quot ; political disturbance &amp; quot ; far more broadly than in &amp; quot ; Castolini &amp; quot ; , finding even in the absence of an uprising that the offenders &amp; apos ; crimes had been committed as part of efforts to avoid prosecution for political crimes .
The case has been described as &amp; quot ; the farthest extension &amp; quot ; of the political offence exception .
In 1962 , the next major case in this regard , &amp; quot ; Schtraks v Israel &amp; quot ; , Lord Radcliffe laid down the outer limits of what could constitute a &amp; quot ; political disturbance &amp; quot ; under the liberal &amp; quot ; Kolczynski &amp; quot ; definition , finding that it required that &amp; quot ; the fugitive is at odds with the state that applies for his extradition on some issue connected with the political control or government of the country &amp; quot ; .
The court found that while Schtraks &amp; apos ; alleged offence of kidnapping his nephew to ensure that he had an Orthodox Jewish education was a matter of political controversy in Israel , he had done it purely for personal motivations without any intention of furthering political change , and so found that his offence was not of a political character . The injured rights test , also known as the objective test , is a primarily French test that looks to whether the offence was directed against the political organisation of the requesting state .
This test explicitly rejects the approach that political sentiments behind an offence make it a political offence .
This was the test adopted in the &amp; quot ; Gatti &amp; quot ; case , in which a San Marino man murdered a local communist and then fled to France .
The French court certified his extraditability , ruling that his offence was not a political offence .
French courts frequently applied this test in cases in which Belgium sought the extradition of Belgian World War II collaborators , none of whom were extradited . However , French courts have also adopted the opposite approach and considered only the motives of the offender to the exclusion of the political aims of the act .
Under this test , an offence is deemed to be political where the offender demonstrates to the court that he or she &amp; quot ; acted with a political motive &amp; quot ; .
One application of this test was in 1975 , when a French court considered the case of two Americans who had hijacked a plane , among whom one had demanded it fly to Hanoi ; against the background of the Vietnam War , the court saw this as a politically motivated act . Also known as the preponderance or proportionality test , or simply the &amp; quot ; Swiss test &amp; quot ; , this test weighs &amp; quot ; the elements of common crime &amp; quot ; against the offender &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; political motive or purpose &amp; quot ; , allowing the political offence exception only in cases where the latter outweighs the former .
As summarised in &amp; quot ; Ktir v .
Ministere Public Federal &amp; quot ; , a 1961 case in which Switzerland certified the extraditability to France of an Algerian National Liberation Front member , the test looks to whether the act was &amp; quot ; inspired by political passion , &amp; quot ; committed in the framework of a struggle for power or for the purpose of escaping a dictatorial authority &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; directly and closely related to the political purpose &amp; quot ; .
As part of the last leg , the court examined the proportionality of the alleged offence .
The preponderance test enjoys the most acceptance among academics , and academic sources have suggested that wider adoption of the preponderance test could aid in addressing some of the issues under the incidence test , such as perceived abuse of the political offence exception by former government officials .
The Supreme Court of the Netherlands also applied the proportionality test in the 1978 case &amp; quot ; Folkerts v Public Prosecutor &amp; quot ; to order the extradition of a Red Army Faction member to West Germany . Some sources regarded the Republic of Ireland &amp; apos ; s approach to the political offence exception as a new test in its own right , while others see it as simply a variation or combination of existing theories .
It is sometimes called the &amp; quot ; connexity test &amp; quot ; ; the result is that the definition of political offence may include an ordinary crime which is connected to another &amp; apos ; s political offence . This test goes back to the 1973 case &amp; quot ; Bourke v .
Attorney General &amp; quot ; , in which the United Kingdom sought extradition from Ireland of Sean Bourke , who had escaped from a British prison with a fellow prisoner .
The political offence exception came into play because the fellow prisoner was Soviet spy George Blake .
Bourke was never a communist and had aided Blake &amp; apos ; s escape purely from motivations of the friendship they had forged while imprisoned together .
Nevertheless , Bourke &amp; apos ; s counsel argued that his offence was &amp; quot ; an offence connected with a political offence &amp; quot ; and thus exempt from extradition under the Irish Extradition Act 1965 .
The Supreme Court of Ireland rejected the Attorney General &amp; apos ; s contention that the connected offence itself had to be a political offence ; it based that opinion on the fact that the 1965 Act did not contain any limitation on the character of the connected offence , and that the preparatory notes for the European Convention on Extradition which had heavily influenced the 1965 Act showed that the parties to the Convention had explicitly rejected that limitation . The first extradition treaty signed by the government of the People &amp; apos ; s Republic of China , with Thailand , provided for a political offence exception ; however , other treaties did not .
Instead , the intention was that the executive branch would use the grant of political asylum to the offender under Article 32 ( 2 ) of the Constitution of the People &amp; apos ; s Republic of China as the reason for rejecting the extradition request .
This is the approach followed in the treaties with Belarus , Bulgaria , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia , and Ukraine . Under Articles 8 of the Basic Law , the English common law that was in form at the time of the handover in 1997 remain as the law of Hong Kong unless they either contravene the Basic Law or have been amended by the Legislative Council , and decisions of English courts before the handover have high authority within Hong Kong . Under , both the judiciary of Hong Kong and the Chief Executive are empowered to determine that an offence is &amp; quot ; of a political character &amp; quot ; and thus that a person should not be surrendered .
It was a matter of some debate among Hong Kong and mainland scholars whether or not Hong Kong &amp; apos ; s agreement with mainland China regarding the cross-boundary surrender of fugitive offenders should also include a political offence exception .
Since the 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong , Hong Kong and mainland China are both part of the same country , and opponents of adding a political offence exception argued that it was only meant to apply among different sovereigns and not different territories of the same sovereign .
One example given in this regard was the arrangement among the states of the United States , in particular the Extradition Clause which contains no exception for political offences and specifically names treason as a crime for which an interstate fugitive must be delivered upon demand .
However , proponents of adding a political offence exception argued that the principle of one country , two systems meant that Hong Kong should have the right not to surrender fugitive offenders for political offences , and to prosecute such offences under laws it passes on its own . Statutory bars to extradition from the United States for political offences are limited ; instead , the political offence exception is provided for in treaties .
permits the extradition of &amp; quot ; persons , other than citizens , nationals , or permanent residents of the United States , who have committed crimes of violence against nationals of the United States in foreign countries without regard to the existence of any treaty of extradition with such foreign government if the Attorney General certifies , in writing , that . . .
the offenses charged are not of a political nature &amp; quot ; , while provides that &amp; quot ; No return or surrender shall be made of any person charged with the commission of any offense of a political nature &amp; quot ; to a foreign country occupied by the United States . To determine what qualifies as an offence of a &amp; quot ; political nature &amp; quot ; , a United States court adopted England &amp; apos ; s political incidence test in the 1894 case &amp; quot ; In Re Ezeta &amp; quot ; , in which El Salvador sought the extradition of its former president Carlos Ezeta .
In the 1896 case &amp; quot ; Ornelas v .
Ruiz &amp; quot ; , the sole Supreme Court case on the political offence exception , the Court held that a group of men charged with murder , arson , robbery , and kidnapping committed during the course of a raid in Mexico were extraditable .
Although the raid occurred contemporaneously with the Yaqui Uprising , the court found that the raid was unrelated and non-political in nature .
U . S .
courts , unlike their English counterparts , have continued to follow a strict definition of &amp; quot ; uprising &amp; quot ; when applying the political incidence test ; specifically in 1986 in &amp; quot ; Quinn v Robinson &amp; quot ; , the court would only allow application of the exception &amp; quot ; when a certain level of violence exists and when those engaged in that violence are seeking to accomplish a particular objective &amp; quot ; ; it found that conditions in Northern Ireland at the time met the definition of uprising , but not in England where Quinn had committed the bombing for which his extradition was sought , and so he was ruled extraditable . U . S .
courts also follow the &amp; quot ; rule of non-inquiry &amp; quot ; , under which consideration of the political motivations of the requesting party is a matter left to the discretion of the executive branch as part of its power to conduct foreign relations .
In the 1980s , extradition treaties with Mexico and the Netherlands made the entire question of what constitutes a political offence a question for the executive branch , which was described as &amp; quot ; the death knell &amp; quot ; for the political offence exception in U . S .
law .
Legislation around the same time proposed by Representative William J .
Hughes ( D-NJ ) and Senator Strom Thurmond ( R-SC ) also attempted to develop more detailed and stringent guidelines for the political offence exception in an effort to prevent terrorists from taking recourse to it , but did not pass .
This was followed by signing of a Supplementary Treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States in 1985 , which sharply contracted the definition of a political offence with the aim of curbing Provisional Irish Republican Army members &amp; apos ; recourse to this provision ; it was the first U . S .
treaty to contain such an exception .
Christopher Blakesley described this as &amp; quot ; evisceration &amp; quot ; of the exception .
St .
Jerome in His Study ( Dürer , 1521 ) St .
Jerome in His Study is an oil on panel painting by German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer , completed March 1521 .
It is in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga of Lisbon , Portugal . The work was executed by Dürer during his stay in the Netherlands 1520 – 1521 , using an aged local man as model .
A preparatory drawing exists in the Albertina of Vienna with an annotation of the man &amp; apos ; s age ( 93 ) . The artist donated the painting to the head of the Portuguese trade mission in the Netherlands , Rodrigo Fernandes de Almada .
It remained in the latter &amp; apos ; s family collection until 1880 , when it was donated to the current museum . Among Dürer &amp; apos ; s depiction of St .
Jerome , this is the one more resembling a portrait , with little space left for the study and its details ( such as in his 1514 etching , where the saint is a small figure in the background ) . The subject is portrayed with great care for details , including the wrinkles to the white-yellowish beard .
Also differently from the etching , the memento mori suggestion of the finger above a skull has a greater visual relevance . Details in the foreground include the inkpot at right and the bookrest at left , as well as a crucifix on the top left . &amp; lt ; br &amp; gt ;
OrtahisarOrtahisar is a planned district and second level municipality in Trabzon Province , Turkey .
According to Law act no 6360 , all Turkish provinces with a population more than 750000 , will be metropolitan municipality and the districts within the metropolitan municipalities will be second-level municipalities .
The law also creates new districts within the provinces in addition to present districts .
These changes will be effective by the local elections in 2014 .
On 30 March 2014 , Ahmet Metin Genç ( AKP ) was elected mayor . Thus after 2014 the present Trabzon central district will be named &amp; quot ; Ortahisar &amp; quot ; and the name Trabzon will be reserved for the metropolitan municipality . There were 9 towns and 38 villages in the rural area of Ortahisar .
Now their official status became &amp; quot ; neighborhood of Ortahisar &amp; quot ; .

The tragedy , starring Lo Tjin Nio , Tong Hui , Lim Poen Tjiaw , and Rohana , was a commercial failure .
It is likely lost . Hian Nio is displeased as her mother , Roti , treats her poorly and favours her siblings .
One day , Hian Nio &amp; apos ; s boyfriend Kian Bie is fired from his work .
Kian Bie &amp; apos ; s former employer , Bian Hong , uses the opportunity to take Hian Nio as his wife .
She is , however , unhappy , and after a year abandons Bian Hong and their newborn daughter .
Eventually Hian Nio returns to claim their daughter , but she dies soon afterwards . &amp; quot ; Sorga Palsoe &amp; quot ; was directed by Tan Tjoei Hock for The Teng Chun &amp; apos ; s Java Industrial Film .
It was his fourth film , following &amp; quot ; Dasima &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Matjan Berbisik &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; Melati van Agam &amp; quot ; ( all 1940 ) .
The story , which bucked a then-ongoing trend of native oriented films , was written by Fred Young ; it was Young &amp; apos ; s first foray into the industry . The film starred Lo Tjin Nio , Tong Hui , Lim Poen Tjiaw , and Rohana .
Filming for the black-and-white film began on 27 December 1940 and was completed by January of the following year .
Music direction was handled by Mas Sardi . &amp; quot ; Sorga Palsoe &amp; quot ; was screened in Surabaya , East Java , by late February 1941 and in Medan , North Sumatra , by April .
The film , targeted at uneducated , lower-class viewers , was a commercial failure .
An anonymous review in the daily &amp; quot ; Soerabaijasch Handelsblad &amp; quot ; found the film to have a tragic ending and emphasised the role of ethnic Chinese in production . The film is likely lost .
The American visual anthropologist Karl G .
Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost .
However , JB Kristanto &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Katalog Film Indonesia &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; Indonesian Film Catalogue &amp; quot ; ) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia &amp; apos ; s archives , and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service .

The EversonsThe Eversons are a four-member indie pop band originally from Wellington , New Zealand , currently living in London .
Self-dubbed &amp; quot ; a guitar group , &amp; quot ; vocals are handled by all members .
They released their self-titled debut EP in 2011 on Lil &amp; apos ; Chief Records , with a follow-up LP , &amp; quot ; Summer Feeling , &amp; quot ; released in 2012 through Lil &amp; apos ; Chief Records in New Zealand and ThisTime Records in Japan . The Eversons were founded in Wellington , New Zealand by Mark Turner ( bass ) , Tim Shann ( drums ) , Blair Everson ( guitar ) , and Christopher Young ( guitar ) , with all members handling vocals . Mark Turner had previously built a name for his work in the bubblegum pop synth group Little Pictures with Johanna Freeman .
He began making music with drummer Tim Shann during that time , and near the end of 2010 they began seriously considering forming a band , recruiting Everson and Young as experienced guitarists and musicians .
The band draws some of its style from &amp; quot ; quirky guitar rock that reaches back from Buddy Holly through to the Modern Lovers and on to Pavement , &amp; quot ; and in interviews the band members frequently call themselves a &amp; quot ; guitar group . &amp; quot ; The group &amp; apos ; s first EP was recorded in early 2011 , using the same studio where the band practices and records .
Released in October 25 , 2011 , &amp; quot ; The Eversons &amp; quot ; received a glowing review in &amp; quot ; Obscure Sound , &amp; quot ; who quoted &amp; quot ; The Eversons are highlights in the fusion of past and present that is art-punk , a genre most recently propelled by names like Art Brut and The Rakes .
The five tracks here are full of the vibrancy found in early punk ; initial simplicity evolves to intricate wit over guitar-heavy arrangements that take turns alternating lead with the singer . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Spindle &amp; quot ; also wrote the EP , &amp; quot ; may very well be one of the strongest perfectly crafted E . P . s since the Nerves &amp; apos ; only offering back in &amp; apos ; 76 , and one of the year &amp; apos ; s greatest releases period . &amp; quot ; Chris Young and Mark Turner often share lead vocal duties on the album , with other members contributing vocals as well .
&amp; quot ; Spindle &amp; quot ; wrote , &amp; quot ; the vocals on these tracks are just as essential to their music &amp; # 91 ; as the guitars &amp; # 93 ; , and the backing vocals are so prevalent they are less backing vocals and more of supporting characters like a Vonnegut novel . &amp; quot ; After the EP the band put out a number of digital singles .
One of these , &amp; quot ; Harlot &amp; quot ; , became controversial for slut-shaming sex workers .
A former bandmate and partner of Turner &amp; apos ; s , Johanna Freeman , considered the song a &amp; quot ; calculated &amp; quot ; attack on her and labelled it misogynistic and offensive . Their first full LP , &amp; quot ; Summer Feeling , &amp; quot ; was released on Lil &amp; apos ; Chief Records in 2012 , both digitally and on vinyl .
About their LP , Stuff . nz wrote , &amp; quot ; It &amp; apos ; s rare these days to hear a band that has honed its sound as sharply and convincingly as The Eversons have .
Clever songs , catchy , funny , playful , subversive - every song with its own pop hook to hang on and from ; loads of ideas .

Dümpelfeld – Lissendorf railwayThe Dümpelfeld – Lissendorf railway was a non-electrified branch line that lay mostly in what is now the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate .
Only a few kilometres of the line near Ahrdorf station ran through North Rhine-Westphalia , which was created in 1946 . The railway line was planned together with the Jünkerath – Weywertz railway ( also called the &amp; quot ; Vennquerbahn &amp; quot ; , “ Cross-Venn Railway ” ) in 1900 as a strategic railway to connect the Ahr Valley Railway ( &amp; quot ; Ahrtalbahn &amp; quot ; ) with the Eifel Railway .
The actual construction started in April 1909 .
On 30 June 1912 , the 44 km route was opened , with the Dümpelfeld – Insul junction section built as a single-track line and the Insul junction – Jünkerath section built as a double-track line .
The construction costs totalled 13 . 2 million marks . Except during the two world wars , the line never had national importance , therefore it has been operated at times under &amp; quot ; Signalisierter Zugleitbetrieb &amp; quot ; ( SZB , a system of train control for low-speed branch lines using simplified signalling technology ) . At the end of the Second World War , many bridges were blown up by the Wehrmacht .
The reconstruction went on for several years until 1948 , when the whole line had been fully restored to traffic .
The Lissendorf – Jünkerath section was shut down and dismantled after 1945 , with traffic directed over the parallel Eifel line .
Henceforth the remaining line was only one track , the second track had been dismantled to provide reparations . The Dümpelfeld – Lissendorf passenger service was abandoned on 3 June 1973 .
Freight traffic on the Dümpelfeld-Hillesheim route ended on 30 September 1973 and the line was then dismantled .
The remaining Hillesheim – Lissendorf section was finally closed in late 1982 and later dismantled . The Insul – Schuld and Dorsel – Fuchshofen sections are now used as a rail trail , the &amp; quot ; Ahr-Radweg &amp; quot ; ( Ahr Cycleway ) .

Alzano MadonnaThe Madonna with Child , or Alzano Madonna , is an oil on panel painting by Italian Renaissance artist Giovanni Bellini , executed around 1485 . The work has been in Bergamo since as early as the 16th century , where it likely arrived as party of the dowry of Lucrezia Agliardi , who had been abbess in the monastery of Alzano Lombardo , whence the name . After several passages of ownership , in 1891 it was donated to the current museum . In this picture , Bellini represented the traditional theme of Mary and Child Jesus as busts in the foreground , above a hanging tapestry resembling the thrones with baldachin which were commons in the contemporary sacred conversations .
At the sides is a landscape with towers , castles and small figures , as typical in the artist &amp; apos ; s production . In the foreground is a red marble parapet where is the usual cartouche with Bellini &amp; apos ; s signature .
There is also a fruit , perhaps a reference to the original sin , or an emblem of the Virgin derived from holy books or hymns . This Madonna is generally considered a model of later works , such as the &amp; quot ; Madonna of the Red Cherubims &amp; quot ; or the &amp; quot ; Madonna of the Small Trees &amp; quot ; , both in the Accademia Carrara .

Super Mario 3D WorldThe game was critically acclaimed for its level design , presentation , replay value and soundtrack , though some reviewers voiced criticism on its unreliable camera during multiplayer .
The game was a financial success , selling over 5 million units worldwide , and becoming the third best-selling game on the Wii U system . The levels of the game follows a similar play style to &amp; quot ; Super Mario 3D Land &amp; quot ; , which combines the free-roaming gameplay of 3D &amp; quot ; Super Mario &amp; quot ; games with the mechanics of 2D side-scrolling platforming games in the series , including a flagpole and timer in the levels .
Up to four players may control player characters , including Mario , Luigi , Princess Peach and Toad .
Additionally , Rosalina appears as a hidden , unlockable fifth playable character .
Similar to their appearances in &amp; quot ; Super Mario Bros .
2 &amp; quot ; , each of the characters possesses unique abilities and controls differently : Mario has balanced running speed and jump height ; Luigi jumps higher and falls slower , but has lower traction ; Peach can jump and shortly float through the air , but runs slowly ; Toad runs the fastest , but cannot jump as high and falls faster ; and Rosalina can use the spin attack move as seen in the &amp; quot ; Super Mario Galaxy &amp; quot ; games , but has the slowest running speed .
The player can select any of the five characters to use before beginning a level , and up to four players may explore the same level simultaneously with each character , sharing from a pool of lives .
Players are also able to pick up , carry and throw each other to either help or hinder their progress . The levels of the game are accessed through a world map , in which players can explore to find hidden secrets or access bonus areas to earn more items or coins .
Each level contains three hidden collectable Green Stars which are required to access certain levels , and each main level contains a hidden Stamp which can be used in handwritten posts to Miiverse within the game &amp; apos ; s community .
Players can also view messages left by other players , both on the world map and after clearing a level , and can download &amp; apos ; Mii Ghosts &amp; apos ; , which are live records of other players completing levels .
They are used to race against and sometimes hold gift prizes such as coins or extra lives .
Additional Green Stars can be earned in Captain Toad levels , where players control Captain Toad , who cannot jump , as he navigates puzzle-like stages using the GamePad &amp; apos ; s functionality , and Mystery Houses , where players must clear a series of challenges with short time limits , as well as challenge levels , that have the player complete quick challenges in fast succession . Along with several returning items from previous games , such as the Super Leaf , Mega Mushroom , Propeller Box and Boomerang Flower , several items are introduced .
The Super Bell gives players a Cat Suit , allowing them to run faster , perform unique attacks and climb up walls to reach new areas .
A variation of the Super Bell , the Lucky Bell , allows the player to temporarily transform their character into a lucky cat statue that awards coins under certain conditions .
Another new power-up are the Double Cherries , which make a clone of the player , allowing for more effective attacks and a higher chance of survival ; the more Double Cherries the player uses , the more clones that appear .
Players can also wear Cannon Boxes , which fire shots at enemies , Light Blocks , which can defeat ghosts and Goomba masks , which let them blend in with enemy Goombas .
Players are also able to pick up various objects , such as bombs , baseballs and Piranha Plants , which can be used to defeat enemies or solve puzzles , and ride around in a Skating Shoe or on an aquatic dinosaur named Plessie . The game features functionality with the Wii U GamePad , allowing players to rub the touchscreen , or blow into the microphone to reveal hidden blocks or items , hinder enemies and activate mechanisms .
The game also supports Off-TV Play .
The game is also compatible with the Wii Remote , Nunchuk , Classic Controller and Wii U Pro Controller .
An unlockable Luigi-themed version of &amp; quot ; Mario Bros . &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Luigi Bros . &amp; quot ; , is accessed by clearing the game or by having save data from &amp; quot ; New Super Luigi U &amp; quot ; . Mario , Luigi , Peach and Toad find a tilted glass pipe .
After Mario and Luigi fix it , a green Sprixie Princess appears and tells them that Bowser kidnapped and trapped the rest of the Sprixie Princesses in jars .
He arrives and captures her before escaping through the pipe , while the heroes enter it and pursue him .
They find themselves in a realm known as &amp; quot ; The Sprixie Kingdom &amp; quot ; and set off to find the fairies .
After the heroes save the final Sprixie , Bowser re-captures all seven fairies and heads to his amusement park fortress .
There after Bowser uses the Super Bell to transform into &amp; quot ; Meowser &amp; quot ; , one of them hits a giant POW Block that Bowser stands on and he falls through the sky .
With Bowser defeated , the heroes say goodbye to the fairies , and travel through the pipe back to the Mushroom Kingdom . In a January 2013 Nintendo Direct , Nintendo announced that a new 3D &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; quot ; game was being produced by the development team behind &amp; quot ; Super Mario Galaxy &amp; quot ; .
The title was announced during the E3 2013 Nintendo Direct on June 11 , 2013 , along with its tentative release date of November 2013 . A staff of 100 personnel wrote ideas for game mechanics upon sticky notes , which were collected upon the studio walls and then evaluated .
If the team liked an idea , they would implement it in-game to test it .
Kenta Motokura , a director of the game stated &amp; quot ; We discussed and discarded a huge number of ideas during development - sometimes you just can &amp; apos ; t tell if an idea is good or bad by looking at it on the drawing board ; when this happens , we try it out in-game .
If we don &amp; apos ; t find the idea fun , it won &amp; apos ; t make it into the final product .
There was a lot of back and forth on the course designs due to this &amp; quot ; . The game &amp; apos ; s signature feline costumery came early in development , to implement an attack mechanic , introduce the ability to climb walls , and to help a novice to clear obstacles .
The inspiration for the Double Cherry , an item that creates controllable clones of a player character , came late in development when a developer erroneously inserted an extra copy of Mario &amp; apos ; s character model into a level .
The team was relieved to see that the game did not crash with two identical characters present , and were amused that both could be controlled simultaneously .
Developers &amp; quot ; scrambled &amp; quot ; to include this feature in the final game . According to Koichi Hayashida , Peach was originally not going to be a playable character .
Yoshiaki Koizumi suggested for Peach to be playable , which would be agreed upon .
Koizumi reasoned , &amp; quot ; I think she adds a lot to the sense of competition when you get in multiplayer . . .
You can have different people choosing different characters based on their personality or whoever they like . &amp; quot ; Hayashida also revealed that &amp; quot ; Super Mario 3D World &amp; quot ; was meant to be a Wii U game that fans of &amp; quot ; New Super Mario Bros . &amp; quot ; could enjoy , as well as a de facto continuation of &amp; quot ; Super Mario 3D Land &amp; quot ; . Similarly , Rosalina was later added as a playable character .
Kenta Motokura said , &amp; quot ; I was thinking about what would be pleasing after the ending and wanted to bring in another female character in addition to Princess Peach .
Rosalina has a following among the &amp; quot ; Super Mario Galaxy &amp; quot ; fanbase , and she appeared in &amp; quot ; Mario Kart &amp; quot ; recently , so I think she &amp; apos ; s well known . &amp; quot ; The game &amp; apos ; s soundtrack was composed by Mahito Yokota , Toru Minegishi , Koji Kondo and Yasuaki Iwata , and performed by the Mario 3D World Big Band .
A soundtrack was released for Club Nintendo members in Japan , Australia and Europe , featuring 77 songs across two CDs . &amp; quot ; Super Mario 3D World &amp; quot ; was critically acclaimed .
It gained scores of 92 . 77 % and 93 / 100 on aggregate review websites GameRankings and Metacritic , respectively .
It also won many awards from media outlets , including Game of The Year ( GOTY ) from Eurogamer , Digital Spy , and MSN UK . Famitsu gave the game a score of 38 / 40 .
IGN &amp; apos ; s Jose Otero gave &amp; quot ; 3D World &amp; quot ; a 9 . 6 / 10 , praising the visual design &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; youthful energy , &amp; quot ; the &amp; quot ; interesting risks &amp; quot ; taken with the level designs , the &amp; quot ; maddening challenge &amp; quot ; offered by later worlds , and the &amp; quot ; genuinely funny and memorable co-op &amp; quot ; .
He said , &amp; quot ; I reveled in the sheer brilliance of how much energy and gameplay mileage Nintendo has packed into every world . &amp; quot ; Otero &amp; apos ; s only complaint was that &amp; quot ; the camera becomes a slight obstacle in four-player multiplayer &amp; quot ; .
GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9 . 5 , praising its gameplay and presentation , while criticizing camera issues and some odd control choices .
GamesRadar gave the game a score of 4 . 5 / 5 , praising improved multiplayer and some moments so brilliant that they can make some other levels seem dull by comparison .
Luke Plunkett of Kotaku called the game &amp; quot ; a terrific Mario game . . .
just not a very good Wii U game &amp; quot ; , praising the game itself , but lamenting that it doesn &amp; apos ; t do much to show off the Wii U &amp; apos ; s capabilities .
Patrick Klepek at Giant Bomb , saying &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; World &amp; quot ; continues to make the case that it &amp; apos ; s possible to reinvent a classic over and over again &amp; quot ; . Anime News Network gave the game an A grade , calling it &amp; quot ; fun , imaginative , and filled with little surprises and delights . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Edge &amp; quot ; rated the game 9 / 10 , calling it &amp; quot ; Wii U &amp; apos ; s best game to date , &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; the most next-gen game that 2013 has yet produced , &amp; quot ; and stating that Mario is the most fun character to play as because &amp; quot ; his cohorts &amp; apos ; abilities aren &amp; apos ; t anything special &amp; quot ; .
Destructoid &amp; apos ; s Chris Carter awarded the game a 10 / 10 , praising the power-ups ( especially the catsuit , which &amp; quot ; open &amp; # 91 ; s &amp; # 93 ; up &amp; # 91 ; doors &amp; # 93 ; platforming-wise that weren &amp; apos ; t there before , &amp; quot ; and the double cherry , which &amp; quot ; Nintendo really outdid themselves in terms of the technical mechanics &amp; quot ; to make possible ) , the &amp; quot ; incredibly sharp &amp; quot ; graphics , and &amp; quot ; one of the best OSTs I &amp; apos ; ve ever heard &amp; quot ; .
Carter wrote that &amp; quot ; the only downfall of the design is the selection of boss fights , &amp; quot ; as Nintendo &amp; quot ; had achieved a level of platforming design that &amp; apos ; s close to perfection &amp; quot ; .
Joystiq &amp; apos ; s Richard Mitchell gave the game 5 / 5 stars , praising the &amp; quot ; astounding &amp; quot ; visual craftsmanship , &amp; quot ; excellent soundtrack , &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; artful , purposeful design &amp; quot ; which &amp; quot ; communicates goals with complete clarity &amp; quot ; . GameZone &amp; apos ; s Mike Splechta gave it a 9 . 5 / 10 , stating &amp; quot ; With multiple characters to play as ( harking back to &amp; quot ; Super Mario Bros .
2 &amp; quot ; ) and an unlockable fifth , a fantastic and unobtrusive multiplayer component and enough new power-ups to make even Mario &amp; apos ; s head spin , you &amp; apos ; re bound to have a highly enjoyable time with one of the best 3D platformers released thus far . &amp; quot ; Eurogamer &amp; apos ; s Christian Donlan gave the game a 10 / 10 , describing it as &amp; quot ; an endless freewheeling treat of a game &amp; quot ; with an &amp; quot ; ad-libbed drive to . . . explore how many different situations &amp; # 91 ; Mario &amp; # 93 ; can be squashed into &amp; quot ; .
He noted that this inventiveness carries over to the &amp; quot ; lavish and quick-changing &amp; quot ; soundtrack : &amp; quot ; This is pastiche at its most skillful , its most panoramic . &amp; quot ; Cheat Code Central &amp; apos ; s Jenni Lada gave the game a 5 / 5 , calling it &amp; quot ; the closest we will ever come to a perfect &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; quot ; game , one that is a culmination of every right decision ever made in the series . &amp; quot ; Nintendo World Report stated that it &amp; apos ; s a &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; quot ; game that one would want to continue playing once the game is beaten and may be the killer app of the Wii U , saying &amp; quot ; Thankfully &amp; quot ; 3D World &amp; quot ; isn ’ t just a refinement of the &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; quot ; formula , it ’ s a powerful re-imagining .
It ’ s an explosive cavalcade of color and excitement as well as a well thought out evolution of &amp; quot ; Mario &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; The Escapist gave the game four out of five stars , but was slightly critical of it , saying &amp; quot ; Buy it if you love that little plumber , and enjoy the new toys , but don &amp; apos ; t expect your mind to be blown . &amp; quot ; In Japan , the game &amp; apos ; s first week sales in three days at retail , totaled to 99,588 copies sold ( not including eShop download sales ) and 57 % of its initial shipment .
The sales were considered low at first , but it maintained strong sales during the following weeks .

Denis BowenDenis Bowen ( 5 April 1921 - 23 March 2006 ) was a South African artist , gallery director and promoter of abstract and avant-garde art in Britain .
He was founder of the New Vision Group and the New Vision Centre Gallery , both of which played an important role in the post-World War II British art scene . Denis Bowen was born on 5 April 1921 in Kimberley , South Africa .
His father was Welsh and his mother English .
After being orphaned at a young age , Bowen moved to England where he was raised by his aunt in Huddersfield .
He enrolled at the Huddersfield School of Art in 1936 .
After serving in the Navy in World War II , Bowen resumed his art studies at the Royal College of Art in London in 1946 . Between 1940 and 1986 Bowen taught art at numerous institutions including : the Kingston Institute of Art , Hammersmith School of Art , Birmingham School of Art , the Central School of Art and Design , the Royal College of Art and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver . In 1951 Bowen founded the New Vision Group , which initially emerged from meetings and displays that he organised with his students in 1951 .
In 1955 , Bowen worked alongside Frank Avray Wilson and Halima Nalecz to open a permanent exhibition space for the New Vision Group and associated artists .
Bowen , Wilson and Nalecz were all members of the New Vision Group and also the Free Painters Group ( later Free Painters and Sculptors ) which had been founded a few years earlier .
Their new exhibition space was called the New Vision Centre Gallery ( NVCG ) , and was located on Seymour Place in the Marble Arch area of London .
While the importance of the NVCG was often overlooked while it was active , its significant role in shaping British art in the postwar period , and in promoting international artists and abstract art in particular , has been recognized in subsequent years .
Artists who exhibited at the NVCG included Aubrey Williams , Judy Cassab , Ron Russell , and Rotraut .
Bowen served as director of the gallery from the time of its opening to the time of its closure in 1966 .
Working alongside British artist Kenneth Coutts-Smith , Bowen launched the Commonwealth Biennale of Abstract Art at the NVGC in 1963 . In the early years of his artistic career , from the early 1950s to the mid 1960s , Bowen formed part of a small group of UK-based artists who were associated with Tachisme and Art Informel .

During colonial Dutch East Indies in 19th-century , to fulfill labor need in its other colonies , the Dutch began to send large numbers of Javanese to work in Suriname .
Most of them works in plantation and agriculture sectors .
Today , there is around 70,000 citizen or 15 percent of Suriname &amp; apos ; s demographic have Javanese descent , and some of its officials , such as cabinet ministers are Javanese .
Bilateral diplomatic relations were officially established in 1975 , although there had been an Indonesian Consulate General in Paramaribo since 1964 . Indonesia sees Suriname as a strategic partner in the region , as its gate and trade hub to enter the Latin America market .
The volume of bilateral trade in 2012 , reached US $ 8 . 9 million in favour to Indonesia .
In 2012 Indonesia ’ s exports to Suriname was $ 7 . 1 million while imports was $ 1 . 8 million , resulting in $ 5 . 3 million surplus in trade balances for Indonesia .

State Emblem of the Soviet UnionThe State Emblem of the Soviet Union ( ) was adopted in 1923 and was used until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
Although it technically is an emblem rather than a coat of arms , since it does not follow traditional heraldic rules , in Russian it is called &amp; quot ; герб &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; gerb &amp; quot ; ) , the word used for a traditional coat of arms .
It was the first state insignia created in the style known as socialist heraldry , a style also seen in emblems of other socialist countries such as the emblem of the People &amp; apos ; s Republic of China . The project of the first version of the state emblem was accepted on 6 July 1923 by the 2nd session of the Central Executive Committee ( CIK ) and the version was completed on September 22 of that year .
This design was fixed in the 1924 Soviet Constitution : &amp; quot ; The State Emblem of the USSR is composed of a sickle and a hammer on a globe depicted in the rays of the sun and framed by ears of wheat , with the inscription &amp; quot ; proletarians of the world , unite ! &amp; quot ; in six languages - Russian , Ukrainian , Belarusian , Georgian , Armenian , Azerbaijani .
At the top of the Emblem is a five-pointed star . &amp; quot ; Emblem was created by Vladimir Adrianov and finished by Ivan Dubasov .
In 1931 , Tajik were added after formation of Tajik SSR in 1929 . According to the 1936 Soviet Constitution , the USSR consisted of eleven republics .
Hence the major new version &amp; apos ; s difference from the previous one was eleven ribbons bearing USSR State Motto inscriptions in eleven languages .
The languages added were Turkmen , Uzbek , Kazakh , Kyrgyz and Tajik . The number of republics in the USSR became 16 after September 1939 , before the Great Patriotic War began in June 1941 , but the state emblem was changed to reflect this only after the war .
By a Decision of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on June 26 , 1946 , all 16 constituent republics were represented on the emblem .
The USSR State Motto was inscribed on 16 ribbons in 16 languages .
Inscriptions in Azerbaijani , Turkmen , Uzbek , Tajik , Kazakh , Kyrgyz languages were updated due to the transfer from Latin to Cyrillic script of the respective languages within the USSR .
Also , several language from new republics were added : Estonian , Latvian , Lithuanian , Moldavian , and Finnish . In 1956 , the Karelo-Finnish SSR was transformed into the Karelo-Finnish ASSR , and soon this was reflected on the USSR state emblem .
By a decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on September 12 , 1956 , the ribbon bearing the USSR State Motto in Finnish was removed . A minor change in the Belarusian inscription was a decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on April 1 , 1958 . Inscriptions on the ribbons ( which are translated into English as &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Proletarians of the world , unite ! &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ) are as follows : The state emblem shows the traditional Soviet emblems of the Hammer and Sickle and the Red Star over a globe , and two wreaths of wheat covered by &amp; quot ; Workers of the world , unite ! &amp; quot ; in the official languages of the Soviet Republics , in the reverse order they were mentioned in the Soviet Constitution . Each Soviet Republic ( SSR ) and Autonomous Soviet Republic ( ASSR ) had its own coat of arms , largely inspired by the state emblem of the Union .
Liquid color measurementThe color measurement of a liquid is the evaluation of that liquid &amp; apos ; s color properties .
This is usually done through visual means , but can also be done by through automated means .
The former provides approximate data , while the latter can provide objective data on the color properties of any given liquid . Visual color measurement is the conventional and usual form of liquid color measurement .
In this case the sample is held up to a series of color standards in order to see which standard the sample most closely resembles .
This measurement is only approximate , but is the less expensive method as the only expense is the set of color standards to which the sample is matched .
This is by far the most commonly used method because of this inexpensive nature . Automated color measurement is a newer method of liquid color measurement .
In this case the sample is contained in a test tube ; the tube is inserted into the instrument , and the color properties of the liquid read out on a screen .
This method can provide objective measurements , but is far more expensive than a set of color standards .
This method is used less frequently because of how expensive it is .
There is also an automated method which compares a sample to its standard , also providing objective measurement .

KomsomolThe All-Union Leninist Young Communist League ( ; , ) , usually known as Komsomol ( , a syllabic abbreviation of the Russian &amp; quot ; kommunisticheskiy soyuz molodyozhi &amp; quot ; ) , was a political youth organization in the Soviet Union .
It is sometimes described as the youth division of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) , although it was officially independent and referred to as &amp; quot ; the helper and the reserve of the CPSU &amp; quot ; . The Komsomol in its earliest form was established in urban centers in 1918 .
During the early years , it was a Russian organization , known as the Russian Young Communist League , or RKSM .
During 1922 , with the unification of the USSR , it was reformed into an all-union agency , the youth division of the All-Union Communist Party . It was the final stage of three youth organizations with members up to age 28 , graduated at 14 from the Young Pioneers , and at nine from the Little Octobrists . Before the February Revolution of 1917 the Bolsheviks did not display any interest in establishing or maintaining a youth division , but the policy emphasis shifted in the following months . After the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922 ended , the Soviet government under Lenin introduced a semi-capitalist economic policy to stabilize Russia ’ s floundering economy .
This reform , the New Economic Policy ( NEP ) , introduced a new social policy of moderation and discipline , especially regarding Soviet youth .
Lenin himself stressed the importance of political education of young Soviet citizens in building a new society . The first Komsomol Congress met in 1918 under the patronage of the Bolshevik Party , despite the two organizations &amp; apos ; not entirely coincident membership or beliefs .
Party intervention in 1922-1923 proved marginally successful in recruiting members by presenting the ideal Komsomolets ( Komsomol youth ) as a foil to the &amp; quot ; bourgeois NEPman &amp; quot ; .
By the time of the second Congress , a year later , however , the Bolsheviks had , in effect , acquired control of the organization , and it was soon formally established as the youth division of the Communist party .
However , the party was not very successful overall in recruiting Russian youth during the NEP period ( 1921-1928 ) . This came about because of conflict and disillusionment among Soviet youth who romanticised the spontaneity and destruction characteristic of War Communism ( 1918-1921 ) and the Civil War period .
They saw it as their duty , and the duty of the Communist Party itself , to eliminate all elements of Western culture from society .
However , the NEP had the opposite effect : after it started , many aspects of Western social behavior began to reemerge .
The contrast between the &amp; quot ; Good Communist &amp; quot ; extolled by the Party and the capitalism fostered by NEP confused many young people .
They rebelled against the Party &amp; apos ; s ideals in two opposite ways : radicals gave up everything that had any Western or capitalist connotations , while the majority of Russian youths felt drawn to the Western-style popular culture of entertainment and fashion .
As a result , there was a major slump in interest and membership in the Party-oriented Komsomol . In March 1926 , Komsomol membership reached a NEP-period peak of 1,750,000 members : only 6 percent of the eligible youth population .
Only when Stalin came to power and abandoned the NEP in the first Five Year Plan ( 1928 – 1933 ) did membership increase drastically . The youngest people eligible for Komsomol membership were fourteen years old .
The upper age-limit for ordinary personnel was twenty-eight , but Komsomol functionaries could be older .
Younger children joined the allied Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization .
While membership was nominally voluntary , those who failed to join had no access to officially sponsored holidays and found it very difficult ( if not impossible ) to pursue higher education . The Komsomol had little direct influence on the Communist Party or on the government of the Soviet Union , but it played an important role as a mechanism for teaching the values of the CPSU to youngsters .
The Komsomol also served as a mobile pool of labor and political activism , with the ability to relocate to areas of high-priority at short notice .
Active members received privileges and preferences in promotion .
For example , Yuri Andropov , CPSU General Secretary ( 1982-1984 ) in succession to Leonid Brezhnev , achieved political importance through work with the Komsomol organization of Karelia in 1940-1944 .
At its largest , during the 1970s , the Komsomol had tens of millions of members ; about two-thirds of the present adult population of Russia is believed to have joined . During the early phases of perestroika in the mid-1980s , when the Soviet authorities began cautiously introducing private enterprise , the Komsomol received privileges with respect to initiating businesses , with the motivation of giving youth a better chance .
The government , unions and the Komsomol jointly introduced Centers for Scientific and Technical Creativity for Youth ( 1987 ) .
At the same time , many Komsomol managers joined and directed the Russian Regional and State Anti-Monopoly Committees .
Folklore quickly coined a motto : &amp; quot ; The Komsomol is a school of Capitalism &amp; quot ; , hinting at Vladimir Lenin &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Trade unions are a school of Communism &amp; quot ; . The reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev , perestroika and glasnost , finally revealed that the quality of Komsomol management was bad .
The Komsomol , long associated with conservatism and bureaucracy , had always largely lacked political power .
The radical &amp; quot ; Twentieth Congress of the Komsomol &amp; quot ; ( April 1987 ) altered the rules of the organization to represent a market orientation .
However , the reforms of the Twentieth Congress eventually destroyed the Komsomol , with lack of purpose and the waning of interest , membership , and quality of membership .
At the &amp; quot ; Twenty-second Congress of the Komsomol &amp; quot ; in September 1991 , the organization was disbanded .
The Komsomol &amp; apos ; s newspaper , &amp; quot ; Komsomolskaya Pravda &amp; quot ; , outlived the organization and is still published ( ) . A number of youth organizations of successor parties to the CPSU continue to use the name &amp; quot ; Komsomol &amp; quot ; , as does the youth organization of Ukrainian communists : Komsomol of Ukraine . Not only was the ideal Communist youth an asset to his or her organization , but ( s ) he also &amp; quot ; lived correctly &amp; quot ; .
This meant that every aspect of a Komsomolets ’ s life was to be in accordance with Party doctrine .
Smoking , drinking , religion , and any other activity the Bolsheviks saw as threatening were discouraged as &amp; quot ; hooliganism &amp; quot ; .
The Komsomol sought to provide its members with alternative leisure activities that promoted the improvement of society , such as volunteer work , sports , and political and drama clubs .
These efforts proved largely unsuccessful , since the Bolshevik Party and the Komsomol were not in touch with Soviet youth &amp; apos ; s desires and thus were unable to manipulate them .
Soviet youth remained relatively politically unaware or uninterested during the NEP period . In 1922 with the establishment of the New Economic Policy , the Soviet government changed their rhetoric directed towards the youth from a revolutionary , militaristic tone to one with emphasis on philosophical education through book-learning and stability of the state by peaceful means .
The young communists were uninterested in these new principles , and mass culture campaigns became the most important tool used by the Komsomol as an attempt retain membership during the 1920s . One of the most popular campaigns was the Novyi Byt ( The New Way of Life ) .
At these assemblies , the leadership of the Komsomol promoted the values they considered to be the most important for the ideal young communist .
The New Soviet Man was to be &amp; quot ; a lively , active , healthy , disciplined youngster who subordinates himself to the collective and is prepared for and dedicated to learn , study , and work . &amp; quot ; By establishing strict guidelines to what they expected , the Komsomol was able to denounce the traits and habits they saw harmful to the youth .
It condemned sexual promiscuity , drinking , smoking and general mischievous behavior , as it posed moral danger to the organization ’ s young members .
The majority of the youth did not take this well , as unsavory activities were enticing to them .
At a time when membership was at its lowest ( 1 . 7 million in 1925 ) , the Komsomol harmed only itself , as this type of campaign further distanced the organization from their target audience . The Komsomol also launched campaigns of an anti-religious nature .
The new communist regime wished to dismantle the already limited control the Orthodox church had on society , and the young were generally interested in seeing the upheaval of old traditions than their elders who had lived under the tsar ’ s rule .
The Komsomol rallied members to march in the streets , declaring their independence from religion .
Problems came when the enthusiastic youth took this passion too far .
Open harassment of church members sprang up , and earned the Komsomol a negative image in the minds of older generations .
When the League made attempts to draw back on their anti-religious rhetoric , Soviet youth became increasingly disinterested in the organization . Many youths were drawn to &amp; quot ; hooliganism &amp; quot ; and the Western culture of entertainment , which included cinema and fashion magazines .
It is no coincidence that these youths were primarily from the peasantry or working class .
They saw Western culture as a way to elevate or distinguish themselves from their humble beginnings .
The Soviet authorities eventually made their own films with ideologically &amp; quot ; pure &amp; quot ; messages , but it was not the same .
Soviet pictures , which were often informational or political , lacked the draw of Westerns or romances from Hollywood .
Both the authorities and the youths themselves blamed the NEP for corrupting Soviet youth culture .
Because the Komsomol was simply not as attractive to these young men and women , the government began to limit their cultural and entertainment options .
This signalled the end of the NEP , and the end of the brief influx of Western culture in Soviet Union before Stalin ’ s ascendancy . Militant young Communists were a threat to the older Bolsheviks because they had the potential to undermine the new , NEP-based society .
The shift from destruction of an old state to creation of a new one , mirrored by the shift from War Communism to the NEP , was necessary to maintain and stabilise the Bolshevik regime .
The Party ’ s disapproval of young militants was necessary in order not only to define what was considered proper behavior , but also to maintain social and political control over the masses .
However , after Stalin came to power and the NEP was abandoned in favor of the Five-Year Plans , many of the young socialists ideas were absorbed back into the mainstream and they no longer presented a problem . The ideology of the new Soviet regime under Vladimir Lenin strove to break down societal barriers believed to be harmful to the goal of unity .
Specifically , the regime hoped to elevate women to a level of equality with men .
The Komsomol pushed hard to recruit young women and raise them in this new consciousness .
In the period of the early 1920s , women primarily stayed at home and performed the majority of housework .
Membership of the Komsomol seemed to offer a doorway into public life at a level previously unseen by women of the time .
Young women enthusiastically joined as they were finally given a chance to detach themselves from the traditional patriarchal structure .
Moreover , they were drawn to the Komsomol because it promised them an education during a time when young girls were deprived of a proper one in favor of preparing them for household duties .
The Soviets encouraged women to take an active role in the new system and participate in the same activities and work as their male counterparts .
The Soviets desperately needed to create unity between men and women at this young age in order to establish legitimacy and security to their rule . Major conflicts surfaced when the regime took these new steps .
The Bolshevik Party was not the most popular at the time , and much of the rest of the nation wished to hold onto their patriarchal values .
Parents hesitated to allow their daughters to join the youth organization , because &amp; quot ; the Komsomol seemed like an immoral organization , for it removed young girls from adult control , and then required them to attend meetings held at night . &amp; quot ; Soviet citizens felt that if they released their hold on their children , they would be corrupted by the Komsomol ’ s influence .
They also worried that if their daughters became independent and promiscuous , then no man would want to marry them .
Moreover , parents wondered who would take care of the home if all the young women left home to join the Komsomol . Women , generally , were also unprepared for the realities of the workforce .
The ancient structure of female subordination allowed for little in terms of work experience .
Men had been given better education and were traditionally raised to take part in military and industry .
Therefore , they had a much wider range of opportunity than women whose only role had been caretaking .
Here lies the irony of the regime ’ s efforts ; the Komsomol tried desperately to empower young women achieve equality , yet women ’ s perceptions of themselves worsened because they were now being directly compared to their much more prepared counterparts . Even though the Communist Party preached and demanded equality , men dominated both the governing body and the Komsomol ’ s leadership .
Upward mobility , contrary to initial belief , was incredibly hard for women to achieve .
In addition , the organization openly encouraged its female members to pursue positions of teaching and nurturing of young Soviets rather than positions of real authority . The Komsomol also found it difficult to recruit and motivate young women amongst the rural populations .
During NEP , this demographic represented only 8 % of the organization .
Poor membership numbers from rural areas were the result of several different factors .
By 1925 , the failure to implement equality in the Komsomol was evident to young rural women , society still perceiving them to be inferior both because they were women and because they came from the peasant class .
Various women ’ s organizations criticized the Komsomol for these failures .
Chiefly , the Women ’ s Bureau of the Communist Party , known as Zhenotdel , openly criticized the youth organization .
Komsomol women were provided little in the way of programs that might encourage their involvement .
Annual conferences , where organization leaders gathered to discuss topics of interest to female members , were in fact the only activities in which early Komsomol women took part .
The Youth League therefore made concerted efforts to resolve these issues and raise membership amongst peasant women . The Komsomol ’ s original tactic to recruit peasant women failed miserably .
Representatives were sent to the countryside to reveal to potential recruits that they were being oppressed by male dominance , and that the youth organization provided them with an opportunity to recreate themselves as independent women .
However , women did not rally to the League in the numbers that the organization hoped for .
The Komsomol turned to the Zhenotdel , which was more favorable to young peasant women , and cooperated with them to achieve better results .
Another strategy was the addition of activities suited to the interests of the target demographic .
Sewing and knitting classes became popular during the 1920s for rural Komsomol women .
Additionally , educational classes , such as health and feminine hygiene were used to both draw more female members and alleviate concerns of rural parents .
Peasant families were more inclined to allow their daughters to join the Komsomol since they knew they would be participating in beneficial programs rather than mischievous behaviors such as drinking and dancing . Soldiers returning from the Civil War , students in provincial towns , and workers fleeing the poverty of the cities established the first rural Komsomol cells in 1918 .
Most administrators , who wanted to retain the &amp; quot ; proletarian character &amp; quot ; of the organization , did not initially welcome peasants into the Komsomol .
However , it soon became obvious that peasants were too large a part of the population ( 80 % ) to ignore .
Also , peasants , who were benefiting from the NEP ’ s compromise with small producers , were in a better position to join than workers , who struggled with unemployment and other economic problems and thus had less interest in joining . Older peasants reacted negatively to the growth of the Komsomol in rural areas .
They saw the administrators as intruders who prevented their children from fulfilling their family obligations .
The Komsomol needed full-time commitment , and peasant youths , who saw it as a chance for social mobility , education , and economic success , were willing to abandon their traditional duties to join .
At the end of NEP , the majority of Komsomol members were peasants , while the administration remained largely urban . Both the urban and rural populations had problems with the Komsomol ’ s attempts to unify the two demographics .
Rural parents believed that because the League ’ s administration was city-centered , their children would be negatively influenced by city dwellers .
In addition , land owning peasants were much more affected by the government ’ s revocation of private ownership , and many were uninterested in allowing their children to participate .

Madonna of the Small TreesThe Madonna of the Small Trees ( Italian : &amp; quot ; Madonna degli Alberetti &amp; quot ; ) is an oil on panel painting by Italian Renaissance artist Giovanni Bellini , executed in 1487 .
It is housed in the Gallerie dell &amp; apos ; Accademia in Venice . Stylistic elements , such as the division of the background , suggest that the work was based on Bellini &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Alzano Madonna &amp; quot ; in the &amp; quot ; Accademia Carrara di Belle Arti di Bergamo &amp; quot ; . The background behind the Madonna and Child includes a hanging tapestry , a typical element of contemporary sacred conversations and which also appears in the &amp; quot ; Alzano Madonna &amp; quot ; .
At the sides are two portions of landscape with two slender trees , whence the traditional name of the picture . In the lower foreground , as usual in Bellini works , is a parapet in green marble with his signature .

COMBOCOMBO , or COMBO &amp; quot ; Culture Kidnapper &amp; quot ; , is a French street artist who started by doing graffiti art in 2003 in the South of France .
After seven years spent painting from Monaco to Marseille , he moved to Paris in 2010 and became an art director at a major advertising agency .
Putting his spray paint cans aside , he then started doing wheat paste . Combo ’ s work focuses around culture and visual jamming , as illustrated by his &amp; quot ; cartoon series &amp; quot ; in which he manipulates iconic pictures , replacing some elements by others taken from the comics or the video games universe to change these pictures &amp; apos ; meaning according to what he wants to express . By appealing to generation Y ’ s pop culture , Combo hits his target at heart and takes it back to the unfairness that makes our world - whether cultural , financial or identity-related . Combo was &amp; quot ; savagely beaten &amp; quot ; by &amp; quot ; four youths &amp; quot ; on 30 January 2015 and suffered a dislocated shoulder after he painted a wall at Porte Dorée near Paris with the word &amp; quot ; coexist &amp; quot ; written with letters created from religious symbols . The majority of COMBO &amp; apos ; s work is made of wheat pasted prints that he unpastes and then pastes back on canvas , giving it a true street feel .
Whatever their size and as an advertiser would do , he always manages to get his work to be seen by as many people as possible . Committed street artist , COMBO got noticed by the media in 2012 when he introduced himself in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone to paste up real advertisements that vaunted the nuclear industry - his way to celebrate Fukushima &amp; apos ; s disaster first birthday .
Strongly influenced by the cartoon and the video game universe , he also put up a massive Simpsons mural , where &amp; quot ; America &amp; apos ; s beloved animated family seems to be having a great time , picnicking on a grassy mound , all while Homer &amp; apos ; s nuclear power plant is seen menacingly in the background &amp; quot ; .
The Simpsons piece , though , has somehow been the only one that international media relayed . In September 2012 , he set up an exhibit for pigeons right in front of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris , and hung about twenty of the most famous art pieces - that he would obviously have hijacked first - at eyes-height of the birds .
Early December , COMBO collaborated with other street artists and realized a pop-up installation place de la Bourse in the 2nd arrondissement , minutes away from AFP ’ s headquarters , to pay a tribute to the 162 homeless persons who died in the street over the six previous months . In January 2013 he struck again in China , where he went to denunciate Google ’ s decision to definitively give up on getting its service back to mainland China .
It ’ s in the streets of Hong Kong that he chose to put his work out , giving a second life to the most recognizable Google pages censored by the Party : Tiananmen Square protests , Ai Weiwei ’ s recent arrest , Tibet … An initiative that led to his first solo exhibit in Paris : &amp; quot ; Golden Shield &amp; quot ; , as per the other name of the « Great Firewall of China » . Late Spring , COMBO came back to Paris and settled down in the rue des Petits-Carreaux for his second exhibit , getting a lot of attention both from the neighborhood and the Internets by pasting up a + 30 ft .
high portrait of a dandy version of Yoda .
As opposed to most of his projects since Chernobyl , &amp; quot ; Old-Up &amp; quot ; didn &amp; apos ; t have any political dimension , allowing him to get back to his roots : cartoon . Finally , on July 14th and to celebrate Bastille Day he pasted up a massive collage on the banks of the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris , realized in association with the Femen - a feminist protest group founded in Ukraine in 2008 and now operating out of Paris .
The piece consisted in a reinterpretation of Liberty leading the people by Delacroix , in which it is not the Jacobins but women who march towards their freedom .
By jamming such an iconic piece of art , COMBO not only intended to pay a tribute to the activists ’ fight , but also to denunciate the discrimination and other misogynistic behavior women still suffer too often nowadays .

He stays with his daughter , Emily Chan who lives in New York City .
But now it appears the incident is being investigated and he needs to find one of them quickly in order to verify his innocence . He asks Mr .
Jameson to help him find them , but he wants it done quietly because it seems that there are elements who want him convicted , so Jameson asks Peter Parker to talk to three ex-Marines on his behalf , but also to find them discreetly .
However , it seems one of those elements is an industrialist , Zeider , who is among the ones being considered to build a power plant for the Chinese Government that is worth one billion dollars , and the industrialist knows that the official is considering another company but if he &amp; apos ; s convicted he knows that his successor will award the contract to him .
So he sends Clyde Evans to make sure he doesn &amp; apos ; t find his witnesses or make sure he doesn &amp; apos ; t return to China alive . As Spider-Man , Peter saves Min &amp; apos ; s life several times .
Then Peter gets a line of the last of the Marines needed to clear Min &amp; apos ; s name , Professor Dent , who agrees to help .
Along with Min , Peter and his own niece Emily , he flies to Hong Kong to testify .
However , Zeider has Dent kidnapped to ensure his silence .
With Emily &amp; apos ; s help , Spider-Man traces the kidnappers to Zeider .
He captures Zeider , ensuring the safety of Dent &amp; apos ; s life .

Donkey Kong Country : Tropical FreezeDonkey Kong Country : Tropical Freeze is a side-scrolling platformer video game developed by Retro Studios , with assistance from Monster Games , and published by Nintendo for the Wii U .
The fifth installment in the main &amp; quot ; Donkey Kong Country &amp; quot ; series , &amp; quot ; Donkey Kong Country : Tropical Freeze &amp; quot ; is the direct sequel to the 2010 Wii game , &amp; quot ; Donkey Kong Country Returns &amp; quot ; , and was released worldwide in February 2014 .
An enhanced port for the Nintendo Switch was released in May 2018 . The game continues on from the side-scrolling platform gameplay of the &amp; quot ; Donkey Kong Country &amp; quot ; series and sees Donkey Kong and his friends travelling through six different islands in order to defeat the Snowmads .
Controls are similar to the previous game , with the addition of being able to pluck items from the ground and pick up and throw stunned enemies , and various controllers can be used with customizable controls .
Like the previous game , players primarily control Donkey Kong who is assisted by a companion , who either provide additional abilities to Donkey Kong , or can be controlled individually by a second player .
Along with Diddy Kong , who returns with his barrel jet pack for crossing large gaps , two additional characters are added ; Dixie Kong and Cranky Kong .
Dixie has the ability to spin her ponytail into a propeller and slowly descend through the air , with an initial boost in height at the start , allowing her and Donkey Kong to fly up out-of-reach platforms or items .
Cranky , in a similar mechanic to the &amp; quot ; DuckTales &amp; quot ; video game , can use his cane to bounce on dangerous surfaces such as spiky thorns and reach higher areas and defeat certain enemies the other Kongs cannot .
Filling up a &amp; apos ; Kong-POW &amp; apos ; meter allows Donkey Kong and his partner to perform a special move which defeats all on-screen enemies and converts them into items depending on the partner . The Super Guide from the previous game is absent and is replaced by an expanded shop , run by Funky Kong , offering various support items such as temporary invincibility .
Like the previous game , each level contains various Kong letters and puzzle pieces , some of which require specific partners to reach , which unlock various bonuses and hidden levels .
The Time Attack mode also returns , now featuring online leaderboards , allowing players to view video replays of the top ranked players . The Nintendo Switch version of the game features Funky Kong as a new playable character .
In the optional easier Funky Mode , Funky Kong is playable with no possible companions , along with an option to switch between him and Donkey Kong .
Unlike Donkey Kong in the game &amp; apos ; s normal mode , Funky Kong comes with five hit points instead of two , while he is also able to double-jump , hover in mid-air , stand on spikes and breathe underwater for an unlimited time .
When DK is played as , he can gain a companion and each Kong has three hit points . The story begins at Donkey Kong &amp; apos ; s hut , where the Kongs are celebrating his birthday .
Suddenly , one of the balloons flies off the Kong house and over the sea , where Snowmad ships are stationed .
Far away from the island , a Pointy Tuck watches over them , locating the Kong house and relaying info to their leader , shrouded in a dark silhouette .
Upon the leader nodding their approval , the Pointy Tucks bring him a horn which he blows , creating a large amount of wind , as well as an ice dragon . Just as he is about to blow the candle out of the fire , Donkey Kong notices a mysterious snowflake that appears and puts out the candle on his birthday cake .
He turns away with a frustrated look on his face as he hears an uproar , and he and the other Kongs exit the house .
The ice dragon from earlier flies toward Donkey Kong Island , turning the sea under it to ice .
The Kongs are then blown away from the island by the ice dragon &amp; apos ; s intense winds , landing on the Lost Mangroves island .
Afterwards , a large ship stations itself where the Volcano from &amp; quot ; Donkey Kong Country Returns &amp; quot ; used to be , and the Snowmads seize Donkey Kong Island for their own , turning it into a frosty area with continuous snowfall .
Donkey Kong and his friends Diddy , Dixie and Cranky land inside an aircraft where the player must use the Y and X buttons to ground pound , causing the plane to break in half . After traversing across 5 islands with each posing its own threats , the Kongs finally arrive at Donkey Kong Island under control of the Snowmads .
The Kongs make their way through the frozen fortress until they encounter the leader of the Snowmads , Lord Fredrik , who challenges the Kongs to a final battle deep in the depths of the volcano .
After a long battle , Donkey Kong delivers the final punch to Lord Fredrik , which sends him flying out through the roof of the Snowmad &amp; apos ; s ship , destroying it in the process .
The Kongs wander out of the remains of the ship and look out from the mountainside to see the end of Lord Fredrik &amp; apos ; s fall .
Lord Fredrik crashes into the remainder of the Snowmad ships out in the seas of the island , defeating the entire Snowmad clan and freeing the island from their control .
Donkey Kong then notices that the horn that was used to freeze their island fell out of Lord Fredrik &amp; apos ; s hands during his fall , which he catches and blows into , producing a breeze of flowers that carries the Kongs to the bottom of the island .
The Kongs watch and rejoice as the breeze of the flowers flutter around the island , melting all of the ice and snow , turning Donkey Kong Island back to normal .
In a post credits scene , Donkey Kong discovers a box and opens it , unveiling a mysterious relic that unlocks the world Secret Seclusion . The game &amp; apos ; s story focuses on the Snowmads , a group of Viking-themed arctic animals such as walruses , owls and penguins that invade Donkey Kong Island , forcing Donkey Kong to go against them with the help of his friends Diddy Kong , Dixie Kong , and Cranky Kong .
This is Dixie Kong &amp; apos ; s third appearance in the main series and the first since &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; , released in 1996 .
This is also Cranky Kong &amp; apos ; s first appearance as a playable character in the series . The game was first announced during Nintendo &amp; apos ; s E3 2013 Nintendo Direct presentation on June 11 , 2013 and was produced by Kensuke Tanabe who , having previously worked on &amp; quot ; Super Mario Bros .
2 &amp; quot ; , has incorporated some elements from that game . In August 2013 , Nintendo announced a planned North American release date of December 6 , 2013 , just in time for the holiday season .
However , in October 2013 , Nintendo pushed back the release date to February 21 , 2014 citing the need for more time to optimize the game .
At the VGX Awards on December 7 , 2013 , the release date was confirmed for North America to be February 21 , 2014 . The soundtrack was primarily composed by David Wise , who previously contributed music for the original SNES &amp; quot ; Donkey Kong Country &amp; quot ; games .
Additional music was provided by Daisuke Matsuoka , Minako Hamano , Shinji Ushiroda , and Riyu Tamura under the supervision of Kenji Yamamoto . Its announcement was a surprise .
The development team designed the gameplay to be similar to that of previous series games , apart from a few new features .
Retro Studios president Michael Kelbaugh told Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé that production started on &amp; quot ; Tropical Freeze &amp; quot ; because the team &amp; quot ; had a lot of gas left in the tank &amp; quot ; after finishing &amp; quot ; Returns &amp; quot ; , wanting to include underwater levels and 3D camera work , and to use the Wii U hardware to do &amp; quot ; a lot of really new cool tricks . &amp; quot ; The addition of camera work was the team &amp; apos ; s biggest change .
The dynamic camera swings from a side to a fully 3D view , bringing depth to obstacles in the characters &amp; apos ; path .
Additionally , &amp; quot ; Tropical Freeze &amp; quot ; adds Dixie Kong as a partner character , with has a mid-air hover ability that affects how players access platforms .
The developers also added &amp; quot ; plucking &amp; quot ; objects out of the ground , similar to the game mechanic in &amp; quot ; Super Mario Bros .
2 &amp; quot ; , on which &amp; quot ; Tropical Freeze &amp; quot ; producer had also worked .
The &amp; quot ; Donkey Kong &amp; quot ; creator , Shigeru Miyamoto , influenced the game &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; ground pound &amp; quot ; design and gave other small tips but was otherwise not involved in its development , though he was protective over the series .
Retro Studios had to prove their ability to handle the license , as Miyamoto said , &amp; quot ; This is my baby .
You &amp; apos ; d better get it right . &amp; quot ; An enhanced port for the Nintendo Switch was released on May 4 , 2018 .
It was developed once again by Retro Studios and includes support for new control schemes and Funky Kong as a playable character in an easier optional &amp; quot ; Funky Mode &amp; quot ; . Like its predecessor , &amp; quot ; Donkey Kong Country : Tropical Freeze &amp; quot ; received &amp; quot ; generally favorable reviews &amp; quot ; from critics . Destructoid gave the game a perfect 10 out of 10 , saying &amp; quot ; with the addition of control options to the already proven formula , Retro Studios &amp; apos ; rendition of &amp; quot ; Donkey Kong &amp; quot ; is pretty much flawless . &amp; quot ; GamesRadar gave the game 4 out of 5 stars , praising its presentation and challenge whilst criticising the co-operative multiplayer .
Game Informer gave it a 9 . 25 out of 10 , praising the levels by saying &amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; d rather have a slightly smaller collection of Retro Studios &amp; apos ; best levels than one bloated up with lesser-quality stages in order to hit an arbitrary number .
That finely cultivated assortment is exactly what you get with &amp; quot ; Tropical Freeze , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; in regard to the game having fewer levels than &amp; quot ; Returns &amp; quot ; .
GameTrailers gave the game a 9 . 1 out of 10 , praising enhancements made to the gameplay , and the &amp; quot ; stellar &amp; quot ; soundtrack .
IGN gave the game a 9 out of 10 , praising the game &amp; apos ; s challenge , level design , and boss battles .
Gamnesia &amp; apos ; s Colin McIsaac chose &amp; quot ; Tropical Freeze &amp; quot ; as a Game of the Year , calling it &amp; quot ; a masterpiece of mechanics and level design &amp; quot ; and citing the level Grassland Groove as &amp; quot ; an empowering sensory experience , and perhaps even the greatest platforming level made to date . &amp; quot ; GameSpot , however , gave the game a 6 out of 10 , saying that interesting boss battles and vehicle segments did not make up for &amp; quot ; clunky , repetitive level design &amp; quot ; and poor implementation of new mechanics .
&amp; quot ; GamesTM &amp; quot ; , who gave it a 7 out of 10 , found the game to be as difficult as its predecessors , citing the enemy and obstacle placements , and that the bosses &amp; quot ; assault you with at least half a dozen different attacks and absorb many more of yours before they accept defeat . &amp; quot ; In their review of the Nintendo Switch version , GameSpot gave &amp; quot ; Tropical Freeze &amp; quot ; a more favorable assessment , awarding the game a 9 out of 10 and concluding : &amp; quot ; If you missed out when the game first debuted back in 2014 , give it a shot today .
It easily stands the test of time . &amp; quot ; IGN stood by their 9 out of 10 score , remarking that &amp; quot ; the addition of Funky Mode makes the game more accessible without reducing the formidable platforming difficulty to a walk in the park . &amp; quot ; In Japan , the Wii U version of &amp; quot ; Donkey Kong : Tropical Freeze &amp; quot ; sold over 70,000 copies during its first month of release .
During its first eight days of release in North America , the game sold an estimated 130,000 units .
This game , along with its predecessor , were added to the Nintendo Selects label on March 11 , 2016 in North America . In addition to reviewing better , the Nintendo Switch version of &amp; quot ; Tropical Freeze &amp; quot ; had stronger sales .
In Japan alone , the game sold roughly 88,421 units in the first five days of release , over doubling its debut on Wii U .

Fish protein powderFish protein powder ( FPP ) describes a food grade powder product designated primarily for human consumption applications .
It differs significantly from fish meal products which are designated for animal feed applications .
Fish protein powders have various sanitary processing , purity and functional characteristics which establish them as human food ingredients .
Production plants registered for the USA market are located in Peru and France . Historically , the fish processing methods used for human consumption have been : fresh , canned , frozen , smoked or dehydrated - all of which would be used as a whole food rather than as an ingredient in other foods .
Additionally , an industrial fish industry exists where whole fish and by products from fish processing have been cooked and dehydrated to form a product termed fish meal , which is used for animal feed , pet food and fish feed . With the evolution of refining and processing technology and expanded research on the nutrition of fish proteins and peptides , a new industry has developed for the specific purpose of producing a fish protein powder for human consumption with the intent of reaching new ingredient uses and markets .
The FPP end product is now used in a variety of food ingredient applications including sports nutrition , food additives and supplements , all of which depend on the finished fish protein powder produced such that it is hygienically safe and also meets sensory requirements of taste , odor and function in prepared foods . Enzymatic hydrolysis similar to the body &amp; apos ; s natural digestive process provides the most efficient breakdown of the proteins into smaller fractions termed peptides which can then be separated from the oil and non-digested proteins during liquid phase processing .
Subsequent steps of solids and oil removal through various mechanical separation techniques are required to create a final fish protein fraction with acceptable organoleptic properties for use in human food .
Minimization of odor through the elimination of fat and oil from the protein fraction , as well as separating out the lowest molecular weight protein fractions from the larger fractions all serve to create a refined fish protein .
Some processes utilize solvents to extract the fat but these can result in dangerous handling and potential residual issues .
The final step in producing the product is typically spray drying , which involves atomizing the liquid protein in a hot air chamber resulting in rapid evaporation of the water and a fine powder falling to the bottom of the chamber for removal .
Spray drying is different from typical oven dehydration used in animal grade fish meal production in that spray drying will not denature the protein fraction resulting in a higher quality protein product for human consumption . The two basic categories used to classify fish protein powders are dependent on the levels of protein , fat , mineral and carbohydrate contained in the powder .
The minerals are mostly naturally occurring , organic complexes of magnesium , calcium and phosphorus .
The spray drying process may utilize other minerals and carbohydrates to improve flow characteristics of the final product thus altering the natural balance .
Powders will all have a residual moisture content in the 4-8 % range . Any animal that consumes a whole protein must break down and digest the protein order to absorb the nutrients .
For humans this begins with chewing and the addition of saliva enzymes , followed by acid and protease enzyme digestion in the stomach , whereby the end result is a peptide or amino acid fraction ready for uptake into the blood stream via the small intestine .
Research has confirmed that most animals have more Peptide receptors in the gut and lower intestine than they do free amino acid receptors - as such the peptide form of fish protein powder is most conducive for optimal nutritional benefits . Hygienic production of fish protein powder mimics these natural digestion steps , and pending the degree of hydrolysis , the protein powder will actually be a partial or complete peptide powder , ready for immediate absorption in the intestine . Significant elements of the nutritional science of fish protein powders centers around the bioactive and antioxidant properties of the peptide fractions produced during hydrolysis and their ability to have a positive impact on many conditions including gastrointestinal issues associated with irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) and Crohn &amp; apos ; s disease - as well reduction effects on hypertension and fast absorption functionality promotes the addition of lean muscle mass to humans consuming the products .
Further studies showed that peptides in fish protein powders can minimize injurious effects of anti-inflammatory pain drugs .
The University of Maryland School of Medicine concluded that certain peptide fractions from fish may inhibit prostate cancer and possibly other cancers from spreading . Additional benefits of fish protein powders are centered around diet needs of various subsets of the human population .
Individuals who have lactose intolerance , milk allergy , gluten intolerance or coeliac disease ( aka Celiac &amp; apos ; s ) require alternate protein sources . The hydrolyzed nature of fish protein powder ( low molecular weight profile ) leads it to be used in hypoallergenic applications such as infant formulas .
There is no evidence that infants who have a high risk of having an allergy to cows milk should be fed hydrolyzed infant formula instead of breast milk for allergy prevention .
For infants who have a high-risk of a cows milk allergy but cannot be fed breast milk , there is low-quality evidence suggesting that hydrolyzed protein-based formula may reduce the risk of a cows milk allergy compared to cow milk protein formula .
Afro-CuraçaoanAn Afro-Curaçaoan is a person from the island of Curaçao of African descent .
They make up the majority of Curaçao &amp; apos ; s population . Most enslaved Africans came from Ghana ( 15,000 slaves came from this place .
Many of them were Ashantis ) .
The rest of the slaves were imported from Senegambia ( over 2,000 slaves ) , Sierra Leone ( only 669 slaves came from here ) , the Windward Coast ( 542 slaves ) , Bight of Benin ( over 37,000 slaves ) , the Bight of Biafra ( over 1,000 slaves ) , Angola ( specifically Loangos from Cabinda Province .
More than 38,000 Central African slaves were exported to Curaçao ) and &amp; quot ; other &amp; quot ; places in Africa ( 3,268 slaves ) . The Dutch West India Company founded the capital of Willemstad on the banks of an inlet called the &amp; apos ; Schottegat &amp; apos ; .
Curaçao had been ignored by colonists , because it lacked gold deposits .
The natural harbour of Willemstad proved to be an ideal spot for trade .
Commerce and shipping — and piracy — became Curaçao &amp; apos ; s most important economic activities .
In addition , the Dutch West India Company made Curaçao a centre for the Atlantic slave trade in 1662 . Although a few plantations were established on the island by the Dutch , the first profitable industry established on Curaçao was salt mining .
The mineral was a lucrative export at the time and became one of the major factors responsible for drawing the island into international commerce . For much of the 17th and 18th centuries , the primary business of the island was the slave trade .
Slaves arrived often from Africa and were bought and sold on the docks in Willemstad before continuing on to their ultimate destination .
The slaves that remained on the island were responsible for working the plantations established earlier .
This influx of inexpensive manpower made the labor-intensive agricultural sector far more profitable and between the Netherlands and China the trading done on the docks and the work being done in the fields , the economic profile of Curaçao began to climb , this time built on the backs of the slaves . In 1795 , a major slave revolt took place under the lead of the Negroes Tula Rigaud , Louis Mercier , Bastian Karpata , and Pedro Wakao .
Up to 4000 slaves on the northwest section of the island revolted .
Over a thousand of the slaves were involved in heavy gunfights and the Dutch feared for their lives .
After a month , the rebellion was crushed . The Dutch abolished slavery in 1863 , creating a change in the economy .
When the institution was abolished in 1863 , the island ’ s economy was severely crippled . Some inhabitants of Curaçao emigrated to other islands , such as Cuba to work in sugar cane plantations . Other former slaves had no place to go and remained working for the plantation owner in the tenant farmer system .
This was an instituted order in which the former slave leased land from his former master .
In exchange the tenant promised to give up most of his harvest to the former slave master .
This system lasted until the beginning of the 20th century . According to the historian Luis Dovale Prado , between May 1702 and 1704 , Spanish authorities residents in Coro , Venezuela , began to observe successive arrivals of a growing group of enslaved Africans to the east coast of the area , all them from the island of Curaçao and belonging to the French company Guinea ( a French colonial empire organization that was dedicated to the sale of enslaved Africans in American territories and had representatives or commercial factors seats in Coro and Curaçao ) . In 1704 , the concern about the slaves leaks became more important , when the colonial authorities found that certainly Coro had 30 enslaved Africans , including a mulatto , and also had come fleeing from Curaçao using in your crossing some canoes , small canoes or other boats rustic and risky . The Spanish of Coro organized the called &amp; quot ; cacería &amp; quot ; ( hunt ) for to pursue to the Maroons and for that purpose made use of the cooperation they received from the Caquetio Amerndians , with whom they maintained close partnership from the very beginning of the Spanish colonial invasion process .
Wii Party U &amp; quot ; Wii Party U &amp; quot ; is a multiplayer video game consisting of a standard board game with mini-games , similar to &amp; quot ; Mario Party &amp; quot ; .
Over 80 different new mini-games are available .
Multiple people can play mini-games using the Wii U GamePad .
Wii Party U also includes a new accessory , a stand for the Wii U GamePad to allow support for the tabletop games .
&amp; quot ; House Party &amp; quot ; games also return from &amp; quot ; Wii Party &amp; quot ; , and focus on various implementations of the Wii U GamePad and Wii Remotes amongst a group of people . There are four different types of party modes .
The first is the TV Party , which can include up to 4 players that use the Wii Remotes and the Wii U GamePad on the television .
This mode is a boardgame with each tile having some effect upon the players .
The host of the game &amp; apos ; s name is Party Phil and he controls and announces what happens in the game .
The second mode is the House Party where players use the Wii U GamePad as the screen instead of the television with the inclusion of the Wii Remotes .
The third type is the GamePad Party , which allows up to two players to use the Wii U GamePad to play in tabletop minigames .
The final mode is the Minigame mode .
This is where players can challenge each other in all the different minigames from the previous modes . Minigame Collection : One to four players can play all the minigames available on Wii Party U . Freeplay Challenge : One player can play the minigames in order to challenge themselves by attempting to break the records of each minigame . Bridge Burners : Players team up with each other to play minigames and &amp; quot ; knock down bridges &amp; quot ; in order to beat the other team . Dojo Domination : This is a single player mode in which the player challenges 30 computers to the minigames and attempts to last as long as they can . Battle of the Minigames : Two to four players face off in minigames to see who will reach the top of the stage to get first place . Tabletop Tournament : Players use the Wii U GamePad to face off in &amp; quot ; single-elimination or round-robin tabletop tournament . &amp; quot ; Wii Party U received mixed reviews from critics , with an average Metacritic score of 65 / 100 .
According to Edge , &amp; quot ; Wii Party U has no rhythm , and you won ’ t realise just how crucial that is to a party game until it ’ s gone . &amp; quot ; Edge also states that one of Wii Party U &amp; apos ; s problems is its &amp; quot ; multitude of games , &amp; quot ; while spending &amp; quot ; at least as much time explaining itself as it does letting you have fun . &amp; quot ; Unlike Edge , Nintendo World Report praises the game stating that it is &amp; quot ; a fine crowd-pleasing party game , &amp; quot ; featuring &amp; quot ; more than the 2010 Wii game did . &amp; quot ; In Japan , the game was very well received , selling around than 70,000 physical copies on its first week , boosting Wii U sales system to 38,000 units sold .
During the holiday season , the sales of the game were considerably higher , generally occupying the top of the Japanese charts .
As of December 31 , 2013 , more than 518,000 units had been sold only in Japan , entering the year-end Japanese chart at number 10 . As of September 30 , 2015 , it has worldwide sales of 1 . 58 million .

MycorestorationMycorestoration is the use of fungi to restore degraded environments .
It is a multi-method approach to restore damaged habitats such as oil spill sites and logging roads , while also restoring the health of targeted forest sites that have been compromised in development .
Mycorestoration is also used to control insect populations .
It generally uses a four-tier approach of mycofiltration , mycoforestry , mycoremediation , and mycopesticides .
The mycelia of a number of different gilled fungi are used in some of these applications .
Facciolella castleiFacciolella castlei is an eel in the family Nettastomatidae ( duckbill / witch eels ) .
It was described by Nikolai Vasilyevich Parin and Emma Stanislavovna Karmovskaya in 1985 .
It is a marine , deep water-dwelling eel which is known from Chile , in the southeastern Pacific Ocean .
The type specimen was retrieved from a depth of 230 metres .

Huang Chih-yungHuang Chih-yung ( ; born October 18 , 1967 ) is a Taiwanese former swimmer , who specialized in sprint freestyle events .
He is a two-time Olympian ( 1996 and 2000 ) , and a bronze medalist at the 1998 Asian Games . Huang made his official debut , as a 28-year-old , at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta .
He failed to reach the top 16 final in any of his individual events , finishing thirty-third in the 100 m breaststroke ( 1 : 05 . 26 ) , thirty-fourth in the 200 m breaststroke ( 2 : 25 . 96 ) , and fifty-sixth each in the 50 m freestyle ( 24 . 89 ) and in the 100 m freestyle ( 53 . 47 ) . Two years later , at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok , Thailand , Huang shared bronze medals with China &amp; apos ; s Zhao Lifeng and Chinese Taipei &amp; apos ; s Huang Chih-yung in the 100 m freestyle , with a matching time of 52 . 21 . Huang swam only in the men &amp; apos ; s 50 m freestyle at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney .
He eclipsed a FINA B-cut of 23 . 75 from the Asian Championships in Busan , South Korea .
He challenged seven other swimmers in heat four , including Kyrgyzstan &amp; apos ; s Sergey Ashihmin , Goodwill Games silver medalist for Russia , and Kazakhstan &amp; apos ; s two-time Olympian Sergey Borisenko .
Diving in with a 0 . 68-second deficit , Huang faded down the stretch to hit the wall for a seventh seed in 24 . 01 , a slimmest margin closer to Peru &amp; apos ; s Luis López Hartinger and Singapore &amp; apos ; s Leslie Kwok ( a matching time of 24 . 00 ) .
Huang failed to advance into the semifinals , as he placed fifty-first overall in the prelims .
Dogface witch eelThe dogface witch eel ( &amp; quot ; Facciolella equatorialis &amp; quot ; ) is an eel in the family Nettastomatidae ( duckbill / witch eels ) .
It was described by Charles Henry Gilbert in 1891 .
It is a marine , deep water-dwelling eel which is known from the eastern central Pacific Ocean , including Point Conception , California , USA ; Panama , Guadalupe , and the Galapagos Islands .
It is known to dwell at an approximate depth of 734 meters .
Males can reach a maximum total length of 90 centimetres . The dogface witch eel &amp; apos ; s diet consists primarily of small deep-water crustaceans .
Dancer ( novel ) Dancer is a novel based on the life of Rudolf Nureyev , written by Colum McCann and published in 2003 . Nureyev was a Russian ballet dancer who achieved fame with the Kirov Ballet before defecting to the West in 1961 and subsequently became &amp; quot ; one of the most written-about dancers in history &amp; quot ; .
He died in 1992 .
McCann , born in Ireland , had previously written novels , short stories and newspaper reports while travelling and teaching in the United States and Japan ; some of his work was set in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
In 2001 , already having &amp; quot ; a growing reputation as an international writer &amp; quot ; , he moved to Russia where he researched his novel based on Nureyev while teaching English .
A decade after the book &amp; apos ; s publication , McCann commented that he personally saw Nureyev as &amp; quot ; a monster &amp; quot ; . The book begins on the Eastern Front during World War Two , with Nureyev performing for injured Soviet soldiers as a child .
It covers his good fortune in gaining the chance to study ballet in his home country , his success there and then his life , work , loves and excesses as a celebrity after his defection to the West . The story is told partly through brief journal entries portrayed as written by Nureyev himself , and partly through narration by characters who knew him .
The latter include his childhood dance instructor , his sister , his dance partner , and his maid .
These each have their own perspectives and concerns , with sub-plots that add complexity and emotion to the story .
The book does not mention Nureyev &amp; apos ; s death from AIDS . Reviewing the book for the &amp; quot ; Guardian &amp; quot ; , Judith Mackrell said that it provides &amp; quot ; a sharp , enthralling and sometimes scarily acute antidote to the reams of generalised gush that have been written about Nureyev &amp; quot ; , and that &amp; quot ; any reader with a reasonable knowledge of Nureyev &amp; apos ; s life will follow in its tracks with serious pleasure &amp; quot ; .
She suggested that for those who do not already know the facts of the story , frustration may be caused by McCann &amp; apos ; s approach of highlighting snapshots of brilliance and hectic energy while not elaborating sufficiently on the details of the historical events . Possible frustration was also mentioned by Suzy Hansen &amp; apos ; s review in &amp; quot ; Salon &amp; quot ; , in that the book does not give a clear picture of just what it is that makes Nureyev tick .
Despite this , and some lengthy passages that she felt added little to the story , Hansen concluded that McCann achieves a beautifully imagined picture of the effects of a genius on those around him , without needing to define the exact nature of the genius himself . Lisa Allardice , writing in the &amp; quot ; Daily Telegraph &amp; quot ; , found &amp; quot ; Dancer &amp; quot ; too long and &amp; quot ; unchoreographed in places &amp; quot ; , but praised it for its imaginative detail , its effective and absorbing writing style , and its success in capturing the spirit of its subject .
In &amp; quot ; The Stinging Fly &amp; quot ; , David Woelfel also expressed admiration for McCann &amp; apos ; s energetic and intense prose , although he found the descriptions of some characters in the West clichéd , and those of some events in the East to be &amp; quot ; retrospective grandstanding &amp; quot ; . Terry Teachout &amp; apos ; s review in the &amp; quot ; Baltimore Sun &amp; quot ; described the book as &amp; quot ; an engrossing portrait &amp; quot ; and said that its portrayal of Nureyev was &amp; quot ; entirely convincing &amp; quot ; ; Teachout also praised the detailed research that McCann had undertaken to make the many different aspects of the story entirely authentic in their portrayals .
New York Social DiaryNew York Social Diary is a website that publishes photographs of &amp; quot ; the rich and powerful &amp; quot ; socialites and a social calendar of events that they might attend .
It is maintained by David Patrick Columbia , who founded it in 2000 . The &amp; quot ; Diary &amp; quot ; originated in 1993 as a monthly column in &amp; quot ; Quest &amp; quot ; magazine .
The column had a similar focus to the present website . Chase Coleman III of old money and notoriously publicity-shy , has refused to be photographed for any publication since his 2005 wedding photographed by the New York Social Diary .
South Utah Valley Electric Conveyance ActThe South Utah Valley Electric Conveyance Act ( ; ) is a United States Public Law that was introduced into the United States House of Representatives of the 113th United States Congress .
The law transfers ownership of certain electric system equipment , transmission lines , and land ( or access to said land ) from the federal government to the local organizations in Utah that have been maintaining it for decades .
This transfer is the result of mistakes made in the sale of that land from 1986 .
The law passed in the House on June 11 , 2013 and passed in the United States Senate on July 10 , 2013 . The United States Bureau of Reclamation started the Strawberry Valley Project in 1906 .
The Strawberry Water Users Association ( SWUA ) owned and operated part of this electrical system until 1986 , when it sold it to the South Utah Electric Service District .
Due to some complicated paperwork mistakes , all parties involved believed that the South Utah Electric Service District believed that it had purchased more of the land and facilities than it actually had .
This bill is meant to resolve this issue by transferring the remaining pieces to the South Utah Electric Service District . An identical version of this bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Orrin Hatch ( R-UT ) - .
It passed the Senate on June 19 , 2013 by unanimous consent . &amp; quot ; This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service , a public domain source . &amp; quot ; The South Utah Valley Electric Conveyance Act would require the Secretary of the Interior , insofar as the Strawberry Water Users Association conveyed its interest in an electric distribution system to the South Utah Valley Electric Service District , to convey and assign to the District : ( 1 ) all interest of the United States in all fixtures owned by the United States as part of the electric distribution system and the federal lands and interests where the fixtures are located , ( 2 ) license for use in perpetuity of the shared power poles , and ( 3 ) licenses for use and access in perpetuity to specified project lands and interests and corridors where federal lands and interests are abutting public streets and roads and can provide access to facilities . H . R .
251 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to transfer title to the electric distribution system located in Spanish Fork , Utah , to the South Utah Valley Electric Service District .
Based on information from the Bureau of Reclamation , CBO estimates that implementing the legislation would have no significant net impact on the federal budget .
Enacting H . R .
251 would have an insignificant impact on direct spending ; therefore , pay-as-you-go procedures apply .
The legislation would not affect revenues . The electric distribution system was developed as part of the Strawberry Valley Project in the 1920s .
The Strawberry Water Users Association , the nonfederal sponsor of the project , satisfied all federal repayment obligations associated with the project in 1974 .
In 1986 , the Bureau of Reclamation transferred financial responsibility for operating and maintaining the system to the South Utah Valley Electric Service District .
Under current law , the bureau oversees those activities . Under the legislation , transfer to the district of title to the electric distribution system would include all federally owned fixtures and the underlying federal land not shared by other facilities .
In instances where the underlying federal land is also occupied by other facilities and in the case of shared power poles , permanent access and licensing privileges would be granted to the district to perform required maintenance . Under H . R .
251 , the Bureau of Reclamation would no longer oversee the facilities or collect licensing fees from utilities seeking easements .
Based on information from the bureau , CBO estimates that the loss of those collections would not be significant . The South Utah Valley Electric Conveyance Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on January 15 , 2013 by Rep .
Jason Chaffetz ( R-UT ) .
It was immediately referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources , and then to the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power on January 31 , 2013 .
On May 17 , 2013 it was reported by the Committee on Natural Resources alongside House Report 113-78 .
On June 10 , 2013 , the official website of Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the bill would be on the floor schedule for Tuesday June 11 , 2013 .
On June 11 , 2013 , the bill passed the House under a suspension of the rules in Roll Call Vote 212 with a final tally of 404-0 . The South Utah Valley Electric Conveyance Act was received in the Senate on June 12 , 2013 .
It was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders , on Calendar No .
85 .
The Senate voted by unanimous consent on July 10 , 2013 to pass the bill , and it was sent to the President to receive his signature or veto . President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on July 18 , 2013 . Speaking in favor of the bill , Senator Hatch said that &amp; quot ; giving the South Utah Valley Electric District ownership of its systems just makes sense . &amp; quot ; Representative Chaffetz , another supporter of the bill , said that the &amp; quot ; South Utah Valley Electric Conveyance Act ( is ) vital for securing diverse energy sources to meet the demands of Utah ’ s growing population . &amp; quot ; In a statement on his Facebook page , Rep .
Justin Amash ( R-MI ) explained his vote in favor of the bill by saying &amp; quot ; the bill holds these non-federal entities harmless for a mistake the federal government made when it oversaw the 1986 sale .
Transferring ownership of the system — which no longer brings in any federal revenue — will also reduce costs to the government associated with maintaining the system and administering the land . &amp; quot ;
Facciolella gilbertiiFacciolella gilbertii , known commonly as the Dogface witch-eel , is an eel in the family Nettastomatidae ( duckbill / witch eels ) .
It was described by Samuel Garman in 1899 .
It is a marine , deep water-dwelling eel which is known from the eastern central Pacific Ocean , including California , USA , and Panama .
It is known to dwell at a depth of 935 metres .
It is often caught in bottom trawls .
Females are oviparous , and the larvae are planktonic .
Males can reach a maximum total length of 61 centimetres . The species epithet &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; gilbertii &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; was given in honour of American ichthyologist Charles H .
Gilbert .
&amp; quot ; F .
gilbertii &amp; quot ; &amp; apos ; s diet consists of deep-sea crustaceans and zooplankton .

Could It Be ( Charlie Worsham song ) &amp; quot ; Could It Be &amp; quot ; is a song recorded by American country music artist Charlie Worsham .
It was released in January 2013 as his debut single .
It is included on his debut album , &amp; quot ; Rubberband &amp; quot ; , released on August 20 , 2013 via Warner Bros .
Records .
The song was written by Worsham , Ryan Tyndell and Marty Dodson . In the song , the male narrator wakes to find that he and a female friend , after drinking too much alcohol have slept together .
The song continues on as the singer wonders if they will become a relationship , pondering &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Could it be the end of &amp; quot ; Just friends &amp; quot ; And the start of something more &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; , or if they should &amp; quot ; write it off , as a sweet mistake &amp; quot ; .
Billy Dukes of &amp; quot ; Taste of Country &amp; quot ; gave the song four stars out of five , comparing Worsham favorably to Keith Urban and Vince Gill .
Dukes wrote that &amp; quot ; While he doesn ’ t show the range Gill is known for on this song , his vocals are similarly smooth &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; after a few listens , lines like those in the pre-chorus begin to stand out . &amp; quot ; Bobby Peacock of &amp; quot ; Roughstock &amp; quot ; gave the song four and a half stars out of five , saying that &amp; quot ; Worsham &amp; apos ; s easygoing charm sells the song , his range and phrasing recalling Marty Roe of Diamond Rio . &amp; quot ; Peacock also praised the song &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; tight production , &amp; quot ; adding that &amp; quot ; strong acoustic guitar riffs and tight percussion are the main focus here , never getting overly loud or overpowering his voice . &amp; quot ; Giving it a &amp; quot ; thumbs up &amp; quot ; , Liv Carter of Urban Country News wrote that &amp; quot ; While there is nothing particularly innovative here , the trio kept it simple , resisted romantic cliches , and created a pretty irresistible tune . &amp; quot ; She also praised the instrumentation as &amp; quot ; rootsy &amp; quot ; .

Love &amp; amp ; amp ; Mercy ( film ) Love &amp; amp ; Mercy ( stylized as love &amp; amp ; mercy ) is a 2014 American biographical drama film directed by Bill Pohlad that focuses on the Beach Boys &amp; apos ; co-founder and leader Brian Wilson and his struggles with mental illness during the 1960s and 1980s .
The film , deriving its title from the 1988 song by Wilson , stars Paul Dano and John Cusack as the young and middle-aged Wilson , respectively , with Elizabeth Banks as his second wife Melinda Ledbetter , and Paul Giamatti as his psychotherapist Dr .
Eugene Landy . The film premiered in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on September 7 , 2014 and was released by Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions on June 5 , 2015 .
It grossed $ 28 . 6 million over a $ 10 million budget and received critical acclaim from reviewers , lauded for its unorthodox style , original score by Atticus Ross , Dano &amp; apos ; s performance as Wilson in the 1960s , and scenes that closely recreated Wilson &amp; apos ; s studio recording methods during the making of &amp; quot ; Pet Sounds &amp; quot ; ( 1966 ) .
Wilson – who had little involvement during development – praised the film for being &amp; quot ; very factual . &amp; quot ; It was nominated for two Golden Globes : Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture ( Paul Dano ) and Best Original Song ( &amp; quot ; One Kind of Love &amp; quot ; ) . The film alternates between the 1960s and the 1980s .
The early timeline begins with a young Brian Wilson ( Paul Dano ) suffering a panic attack on an airplane .
It is agreed with the rest of the Beach Boys that Brian will no longer tour with them and will instead focus on composition and studio work .
Despite resistance from some of his bandmates , Brian completes the &amp; quot ; Pet Sounds &amp; quot ; album .
It is a critical hit , but sales are underwhelming .
LSD is supplied to Brian by a coterie of hippie vagrants who praise him as a &amp; quot ; genius &amp; quot ; , and his mental health subsequently worsens .
After the success of a new single , &amp; quot ; Good Vibrations &amp; quot ; , he fails to complete the album &amp; quot ; Smile &amp; quot ; , his would-be masterpiece .
As Brian &amp; apos ; s bandmates record their next record without him , he learns that his father has illegitimately sold the publishing rights to the Beach Boys &amp; apos ; songs .
This timeline ends with Brian apathetic and detached from life . In the 1980s , an older and heavily medicated Brian ( John Cusack ) meets Melinda Ledbetter ( Elizabeth Banks ) , a Cadillac saleswoman .
She begins a relationship with him , but is disturbed by the controlling influence Brian &amp; apos ; s therapist and legal guardian Dr .
Eugene Landy ( Paul Giamatti ) has over Brian &amp; apos ; s life .
Eventually , she disengages from the relationship , but not before providing evidence to Brian &amp; apos ; s family that Landy has been made a beneficiary in his will .
This leads to a restraining order being taken out to prevent Landy from seeing Brian , who begins a new and more appropriate course of treatment .
Brian accidentally meets Ledbetter again while walking across an intersection , and they eventually get married . A theatrical film adaptation of Wilson &amp; apos ; s life , titled &amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; , was first proposed in 1988 , and was planned to star William Hurt as Wilson and Richard Dreyfuss as Landy .
It derived its title from Wilson &amp; apos ; s then-latest single , &amp; quot ; Love and Mercy &amp; quot ; ( 1988 ) , which appeared as the opening track to his debut solo album &amp; quot ; Brian Wilson &amp; quot ; .
While the project stagnated in development hell , the Beach Boys were eventually featured as the subject of two made-for-TV dramatizations : &amp; quot ; Summer Dreams : The Story of The Beach Boys &amp; quot ; ( 1990 ) which was widely derided for their historical inaccuracies and &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( 2000 ) .
&amp; quot ; Rolling Stone &amp; quot ; reported in 1999 that Melinda hoped to organize a Wilson biopic which starred Jeff Bridges .
In 2006 , the Wilson biopic project was briefly revived , and was to have included involvement from producers Mark Gordon , Lawrence Inglee , Jordan Wynn , and David Leaf .
Nothing further was reported . As film producer / director Bill Pohlad cultivated an obsession with the 1997 box set &amp; quot ; The Pet Sounds Sessions &amp; quot ; , he became interested in Brian Wilson &amp; apos ; s life while eventual producers John Wells and Claire Rudnick Polstein were attempting to make a Beach Boys film .
&amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; is the second feature directed by Pohlad – decades from his previous – and was financed with his own money .
After the film was formally announced on June 23 , 2011 , information about it remained relatively scarce until its unveiling in September 2014 . Pohlad deemed the original script he received ( titled &amp; quot ; Heroes and Villains &amp; quot ; , after the Beach Boys &amp; apos ; song ) unsatisfactory , and so he enlisted writer-director Oren Moverman , who had previously found success with the impressionistic Bob Dylan biopic &amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; m Not There &amp; quot ; ( 2007 ) , which Pohlad believed was &amp; quot ; an admirable effort . . .
&amp; # 91 ; but &amp; # 93 ; went too far &amp; quot ; .
Pohlad claimed that &amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; drew significant interest from &amp; quot ; pretty big people in all parts of the business . . . But a lot of them honestly were such Beach Boys fans that they almost were too close to it .
They couldn &amp; apos ; t see the forest for the trees . &amp; quot ; Originally , Pohlad intended to produce and have Moverman direct .
When Moverman found that Pohlad had a clear vision for the film to be , he suggested that Pohlad direct the movie instead . Rather than having a conventional story , in June 2011 the biopic was reported to focus on specific elements of Wilson &amp; apos ; s life .
At this stage , Pohlad contemplated focusing on three eras of Wilson &amp; apos ; s life instead of two : &amp; quot ; It was Brian past , which was the 1960s Brian .
Brian present , which was the guy in bed .
And Brian future , which became the John Cusack era .
And kind of by interweaving those we &amp; apos ; d show , without having to tell every beat . &amp; quot ; Philip Seymour Hoffman was considered for the projected &amp; quot ; Brian – Present &amp; quot ; role .
When Moverman was asked about his nontraditional approach to musician &amp; apos ; s stories , he answered : In November 2011 , Wilson stated that he didn &amp; apos ; t know when the film would be done , and he was currently &amp; quot ; trying to get the script so it &amp; apos ; s accurate &amp; quot ; .
Though Wilson was consulted on the film , Ledbetter was deeply involved in communications .
Wilson later clarified : &amp; quot ; I had no control or involvement in the film , but my wife did .
She made sure they cast the characters right , you know so they could capture my personality and the records and stuff like that . &amp; quot ; It was reported that Wilson offered some editing notes after attending a table read and after watching a rough cut of the film by himself .
Pohlad explained the purpose of the table read : &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; It was &amp; # 93 ; to make sure he would understand what we were doing .
He sat there and I wasn &amp; apos ; t sure if we lost him or if he was still with us .
But later , he called with some insightful notes .
Not a lot of notes , like three or four , but really insightful comments . &amp; quot ; Pohlad added during a Q &amp; amp ; A : &amp; quot ; They &amp; # 91 ; Ledbetter and Wilson &amp; # 93 ; were never all over us about it – &amp; apos ; Don &amp; apos ; t do that , &amp; apos ; or &amp; apos ; I &amp; apos ; m funnier than that &amp; apos ; . . .
&amp; # 91 ; His notes &amp; # 93 ; were all very directed to – they weren &amp; apos ; t like ego things , they were more like how the process worked . . .
just keeping us on track versus &amp; apos ; make me look better &amp; apos ; or something like that . &amp; quot ; Wilson &amp; apos ; s veteran collaborator Van Dyke Parks – portrayed by Max Schneider – stated that he had no involvement in the film , and awaited its historical accuracy in what he called &amp; quot ; Mrs .
Wilson &amp; apos ; s biopic &amp; quot ; .
On February 8 , 2012 , Moverman announced that the script was complete . Paul Dano was cast as the young Wilson and believed , &amp; quot ; I don &amp; apos ; t think it &amp; apos ; s a totally traditional biopic .
I think it &amp; apos ; s gonna be a fun and accessible film , and I think it &amp; apos ; s hopefully going to be interesting , like the man that it &amp; apos ; s depicting .
I think he &amp; # 91 ; Moverman &amp; # 93 ; did an amazing job cracking this story , and I can &amp; apos ; t imagine anyone else having done it , aside from him .
I know they tried to make movies about Brian for a long time , and I think music stories are tough to tell in an interesting way . &amp; quot ; When asked how familiar he was with Wilson before getting involved , Dano answered that he knew the Beach Boys &amp; apos ; music , but was not aware of the extent of Wilson &amp; apos ; s troubles .
He proceeded to immerse himself in Wilson &amp; apos ; s life by reading , listening , and watching as much information pertinent to Wilson as he could , purposefully abstaining from meeting him in person until he was sure he had absorbed everything in full . Dano reportedly prepared for the role by &amp; quot ; filling up &amp; quot ; on Wilson &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Pet Sounds &amp; quot ; while learning how to play piano .
He explained , &amp; quot ; Without question , learning to play and sing and listening to the music was the most important , because the most true Brian to me is in &amp; quot ; Pet Sounds &amp; quot ; .
If you want to know him , you go listen to it . &amp; quot ; He related to Wilson &amp; apos ; s character adding , &amp; quot ; Some of it is frankly deeply personal .
Brian talked about trying to make music that would heal people .
Knowing that his life was so hard and that was his attitude I felt like that &amp; apos ; s somebody I want to spend time with .
Whether I needed love and mercy at the time or I wanted to give it I &amp; apos ; m not sure . &amp; quot ; Of his musical performances , he recalls , &amp; quot ; There are a few scenes where you hear me start a line of a song and by the end of the session , you &amp; apos ; re hearing Brian &amp; apos ; s vocals .
I have to give credit to the sound people , the transitions are really smooth ; you can &amp; apos ; t tell that one half of it is the real thing and one half is me faking it , so I thank those guys a lot . &amp; quot ; Dano also prepared for the role by gaining weight . John Cusack , who plays Dano &amp; apos ; s older counterpart , was chosen for the role after Pohlad watched Don Was &amp; apos ; biographical film &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ( 1995 ) .
Pohlad found portraying the 1980s Wilson to be difficult , since he believed Wilson &amp; apos ; s appearance changed rapidly in that era , but Cusack immediately popped into his head after watching the biography .
Pohlad admitted : &amp; quot ; He hasn ’ t necessarily always either gotten or taken the greatest roles , but I thought this one would be a good one that would really allow him to shine , and he ’ s truly delivered on that .
A lot of people still come up and say , &amp; apos ; Oh , that Paul Dano looks exactly like Brian , but why ’ d you pick John Cusack ? He doesn ’ t look at all like Brian . &amp; apos ; Actually , he does , if you look back at that one era . &amp; quot ; After being selected , Cusack listened to the 2011 release of &amp; quot ; The Smile Sessions &amp; quot ; , enthusing , &amp; quot ; You get a portrait of the genius at work at the apex of his powers at the time before he kind of went into the ashes , &amp; quot ; and , &amp; quot ; It &amp; apos ; s hard to overestimate his influence on music .
&amp; quot ; Pet Sounds &amp; quot ; was a year before &amp; quot ; Sergeant Pepper &amp; apos ; s Lonely Hearts &amp; quot ; , and everything you hear in the Beatles is there .
And then you listen more .
Especially to &amp; quot ; The Smile Sessions &amp; quot ; , and you hear all these other connections .
Boom , there &amp; apos ; s ELO , there &amp; apos ; s another band . &amp; quot ; Cusack later recommended &amp; quot ; I Just Wasn &amp; apos ; t Made for These Times &amp; quot ; as a &amp; quot ; companion piece &amp; quot ; to &amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; . The decision to have two actors play Wilson was somewhat based on the notion that Wilson today is perceived as a completely different person from when he was in his 20s .
Dano believes : &amp; quot ; It ’ s important to see the juxtaposition of the two people , especially when you see Brian in the studio so vital , and then see the older Brian quiet , almost traumatized .
There is a mystery there , how did that person become that ? &amp; quot ; Cusack elaborated on his experience with meeting Wilson : &amp; quot ; When Brian would talk about the younger version of himself , he was completely dispassionate , like it was someone other than him — in a more extreme way than other people look back on when they were 21 .
Seeing him talking about it , he just had no ownership of himself . &amp; quot ; Pohlad encouraged Cusack and Dano not to work together and conjure an impression of Wilson between themselves , and instead try to get an independent sense of who Wilson is from the inside . Paul Giamatti said of the film , &amp; quot ; I play Dr .
Landy , the crazy psychotherapist .
It &amp; apos ; s a great character .
Brian Wilson had a severe freakout and his family got in touch with a psychotherapist out in L . A .
named Eugene Landy who took over .
That &amp; apos ; s where most of the story comes from , because the doctor was basically insane .
He made Brian play in a sandbox , I mean crazy stuff . &amp; quot ; Giamatti prepared for the role by engrossing himself in contemporary articles , meeting the real life Landy &amp; apos ; s early career acquaintances , and listening to hours of tapes wherein Giamatti says &amp; quot ; he &amp; apos ; d just keep talking and talking , in these completely huge paragraphs .
They were brilliant-sounding , but if you dug into them they didn &amp; apos ; t make much sense . &amp; quot ; Speaking to &amp; quot ; The Daily Mail &amp; quot ; in November 2013 , Elizabeth Banks stated : &amp; quot ; I play Brian ’ s second wife , Melinda , who he is still married to , and who essentially saved his life .
… Brian suffers from a sort of paranoid schizophrenia , and always has , but for years no one knew quite what to do to help him .
… Melinda met Brian , fell in love with him and knew she had to save him from this doctor . &amp; quot ; When finally free of Landy &amp; apos ; s grasp , Brian was rediagnosed with schizoaffective disorder . Looking for a seasoned director of photography , Pohlad sought cinematographer Robert Yeoman , who is best known for his credits on Wes Anderson films .
Yeoman recalled : &amp; quot ; I loved the script and the take on the story .
Bill had a lot of great ideas and I felt it would be an amazing film to be part of . &amp; quot ; He strongly felt that the film should not be shot in Louisiana for tax incentives , and also resisted digital capture , explaining : &amp; quot ; The story takes place in an analog time , so I felt we needed the grain and texture of film to give &amp; # 91 ; the settings &amp; # 93 ; a realistic feel . &amp; quot ; Every scene set in 1960s recording studios was shot in Super 16 , as well as a few other select scenes .
In contrast to Pohlad &amp; apos ; s desire for the decade to look warm and romantic , the 1980s scenes were given a cold white and blue cast . The film &amp; apos ; s studio depictions strove to recapture Wilson &amp; apos ; s elaborate recording processes during the sessions for Beach Boys albums &amp; quot ; Pet Sounds &amp; quot ; and the unfinished &amp; quot ; Smile &amp; quot ; .
To this end , the scenes were shot &amp; quot ; documentary style , &amp; quot ; and real musicians were hired to act as the session musicians Wilson used .
They were also filmed in the actual studios where the Beach Boys &amp; apos ; music was recorded in the 1960s , such as the Studio 3-room at EastWest Studios , which was then known as United Western Recorders .
Pohlad claimed that they were real sessions with direction largely improvised by Dano , who instructed the musicians based on his impression of Wilson &amp; apos ; s tone and the way that he worked : &amp; quot ; We had two Super 16 handheld cameras going , and for most of that we were just able to grab shots as we would if we were shooting a documentary . &amp; quot ; About the musicians , he added : &amp; quot ; We didn ’ t really rehearse with them , or tell them much what we were doing .
They brought their instruments , and we dressed them in period clothing , and we basically sat them down like they were there for a session . &amp; quot ; Yeoman was &amp; quot ; purposely kept out of the rehearsals , so he never really knew what was coming – he just had to get it , &amp; quot ; Pohlad says .
Fly on the wall documentary films such as &amp; quot ; Sympathy for the Devil &amp; quot ; ( 1968 ) and &amp; quot ; Let It Be &amp; quot ; ( 1970 ) were used as references . Principal photography began on July 15 , 2013 in the Hollywood area and expanded to various locations around Southern California .
Shooting lasted for 35 days .
Wilson announced the film &amp; apos ; s wrapping through his Twitter page by posting a photo of himself and his wife along with Cusack .
The film &amp; apos ; s wrap party featured a special appearance by Wilson , who performed a solo live set .
In January 2014 , Pohlad reported that he was currently editing the film in New York .
In July , a casting call was made for additional filming requiring a depiction of 1980s period cars . English composer Atticus Ross was commissioned for an original score .
Ross , who is selective about the films he works on , says he agreed to &amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; because &amp; quot ; I liked him &amp; # 91 ; Pohlad &amp; # 93 ; from the moment of meeting him .
He &amp; apos ; s a guy with vision and that &amp; apos ; s what , as a musician , you need from the director .
His company was built on making the kind of films that I would love to be working on . &amp; quot ; Inspiration for the score came from the Beatles &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; Revolution 9 &amp; quot ; ( 1968 ) and the Beatles / Jay-Z mashup album &amp; quot ; The Grey Album &amp; quot ; ( 2004 ) .
&amp; quot ; Variety &amp; quot ; observed that Ross &amp; apos ; s score &amp; quot ; reincorporates snatches of the Beach Boys &amp; apos ; effervescent melodies into something that sounds intriguingly similar to Animal Collective . Pohlad commented on the film &amp; apos ; s use of original Beach Boys multitrack session tapes , &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; S &amp; # 93 ; o much of what developed out of it was based on the ability to get into tracks .
From a music perspective , certainly , the ability of Atticus and I to get into the tracks and play with them was important .
Also to have the music in the film was important .
It was not ever going to be a &amp; quot ; Mamma Mia ! &amp; quot ; kind of movie .
We didn &amp; apos ; t want that . &amp; quot ; In June 2014 , touring Beach Boy co-founder Mike Love reported that Wilson had been in the studio recording music which would be used in the film . On September 19 , 2014 , Pohlad announced that the film &amp; apos ; s soundtrack would be released by Capitol Records sometime in the future , later reported for release in 2015 .
On June 2 , 2015 , Pohlad reported that there were complications but that the soundtrack should be released shortly after the film .
On August 13 , the digital global release date was announced for the following day . &amp; quot ; Slate &amp; quot ; magazine wrote in its analysis of the film &amp; apos ; s fact and fiction : &amp; quot ; While &amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; makes some perhaps necessary adjustments to simplify the musician ’ s story , the film is generally quite meticulous in its presentation of the events of Wilson ’ s life . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Vulture . com &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; fact-checked &amp; quot ; the film and found that it has &amp; quot ; whopping gaps &amp; # 91 ; but &amp; # 93 ; few of them matter . &amp; quot ; Consequence of Sound reported that the film recreates &amp; quot ; several iconic portraits and moments &amp; quot ; , including the photo shoot of the band &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Surfin &amp; apos ; Safari &amp; quot ; ( 1962 ) to the performance of the live album &amp; quot ; Beach Boys Concert &amp; quot ; ( 1964 ) : &amp; quot ; These are all handled with the utmost accuracy , seemingly down to the lines in the sand , and that acute attention to detail carries over into just about every other facet of the film . &amp; quot ; Audio engineer Mark Linett , who has a longstanding association with Wilson , was employed as a technical consultant .
He also plays the role of Chuck Britz , the engineer who often worked with Wilson during the 1960s .
Keyboardist Darian Sahanaja , who plays in Wilson &amp; apos ; s touring band , was the supervising musical consultant who helped coordinate the film &amp; apos ; s musical segments .
He also served as Dano &amp; apos ; s music coach . Real footage of Wilson appears in the film because of Pohlad &amp; apos ; s concern that audiences wouldn &amp; apos ; t believe Wilson actually acts like how he is portrayed in the movie .
In Giamatti &amp; apos ; s view : &amp; quot ; The problem was that no one is going to believe a lot of this was for real .
It &amp; apos ; s so much more bizarre than you could actually show . &amp; quot ; Some events in Wilson &amp; apos ; s life were , in Pohlad &amp; apos ; s words , &amp; quot ; something that seems like a screenwriter made up just to take the easy way out , &amp; quot ; though he maintains that no &amp; quot ; Hollywood touch &amp; quot ; was added to the story .
While there was an expectation among the cast and crew that audiences would find elements of the film too outlandish or grandstanding , the decision was made to keep everything as factual as possible . In order to write the script , Moverman consulted a wealth of books and articles in addition to speaking to people who knew Wilson in the 1960s and 1980s .
He felt that Landy was the most difficult character to write for , as he says : &amp; quot ; even though many things that he &amp; # 91 ; Landy &amp; # 93 ; says in the movie I actually have recording of , in real life he was a cartoon and in real life he was so over the top . &amp; quot ; Moverman has maintained that everything in the 1980s portions actually happened based on conversations he had had with Ledbetter , with a few exceptions being some topics of conversation spoken by the character Wilson in the film – they derived from Moverman &amp; apos ; s research but were unknown to have happened in real life . &amp; quot ; Slate &amp; quot ; has pointed out that , contrary to what is depicted in the film , Landy did not accompany Wilson and Ledbetter on their first date .
Instead , his assistants did , though Landy checked in by phone numerous times .
In the 2006 biography &amp; quot ; Catch a Wave &amp; quot ; , author Peter Ames Carlin credited Beach Boys fan Peter Reum and biographer David Leaf for bringing Brian &amp; apos ; s condition to the attention of Carl Wilson , whereas the film depicts Ledbetter contacting Carl by phone .
&amp; quot ; Slate &amp; quot ; adds that Ledbetter is aided in the film by Wilson &amp; apos ; s housekeeper , Gloria Ramos , who – along with Leaf – is given special thanks in the liner notes to several of Wilson &amp; apos ; s albums .
&amp; quot ; The Weeklings &amp; quot ; observed that Carl is &amp; quot ; barely an entity &amp; quot ; in the film despite having had a major role in getting rid of Landy .
Other notable real life people who appear in the film – but are given markedly reduced significance – include Wilson &amp; apos ; s family in the 1960s and &amp; quot ; Smile &amp; quot ; collaborator Van Dyke Parks . In July 2014 , a premier screening was announced in the Special Presentations section of the September 2014 Toronto International Film Festival .
It was shown on September 7 , 8 and 11 .
Wilson was in attendance at the first screening .
&amp; quot ; Ioncinema &amp; quot ; ranked &amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; # 153 in its list of &amp; quot ; Top 200 Most Anticipated Films for 2014 &amp; quot ; and wrote : &amp; quot ; you can be sure that programmers from Cannes to Toronto have already found time to grab a first look .
This will receive a red carpet showing wherever it premieres and should at that point be picked up for distribution . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; The Huffington Post &amp; quot ; speculated the film to be one of eighteen most-talked-about at the 2014 Toronto Film Festival .
&amp; quot ; The Hollywood Reporter &amp; quot ; revealed that it was in the festival &amp; apos ; s top 15 in ticket sales . North American rights were purchased for $ 3 million .
For its premiere in Europe , the film was screened in the Berlinale Special Galas section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival .
Wilson also attended this screening .
Its American premier was at the South by Southwest ( SXSW ) film festival in March 2015 . Roadside Attractions distributed the film to North American theaters on June 5 , 2015 .
In other countries , the film will be released by Lions Gate Entertainment .
A teaser trailer for the film was released in February 2015 , with an extended trailer following in April .
Co-president of Roadside Attractions Howard Cohen said that it refrained from &amp; quot ; rushing &amp; quot ; the film for the 2014 awards season : &amp; quot ; Pretty early on , we said , &amp; apos ; let ’ s put it in June ; let ’ s give it space .
Let ’ s let it be the movie for its audience when it comes out , as opposed to &amp; # 91 ; being &amp; # 93 ; one of eight . &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; On August 25 , 2015 the film was made available on digital media and September 15 on physical Blu-ray . In October 2013 , Wilson enthused , &amp; quot ; We &amp; apos ; ve seen some of the film .
So far , so good .
The guy who plays me , John Cusack , he &amp; apos ; s really good .
And he sings well , &amp; quot ; and that &amp; quot ; It &amp; apos ; s quite a thrill to have a movie made of my life .
… I &amp; apos ; m very sentimental about it , and it &amp; apos ; s very , very good .
It was a trip to see .
The actors and actresses portrayed everybody really well . &amp; quot ; Dano worried that the film &amp; apos ; s highly personal content would trouble Wilson , but he reported that Wilson loved the film at its premiere screening , saying &amp; quot ; he &amp; apos ; s a little unfiltered , so you would know if he didn &amp; apos ; t . &amp; quot ; Wilson felt that the film was &amp; quot ; very factual &amp; quot ; ( with Dano succeeding at his portrayal better than Cusack ) and that each character was cast so well that he &amp; quot ; actually believed those characters were really who they were , like the guy who played Doctor Landy was so right on . . .
that it absolutely scared me .
&amp; # 91 ; I was &amp; # 93 ; like absolutely in fear for about ten minutes . &amp; quot ; On the studio scenes : &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; They were &amp; # 93 ; very factual , accurate , stimulating .
I was really blown away by how close &amp; # 91 ; Dano &amp; # 93 ; got to my personality .
It &amp; apos ; s amazing . &amp; quot ; Wilson said that he was &amp; quot ; very concerned &amp; quot ; but hopeful that the other surviving Beach Boys would enjoy the film .
Regarding the trust that Wilson and Ledbetter gave Pohlad for him to construct a true portrait of their lives , Pohlad recounted : Ledbetter said after watching the film : &amp; quot ; I remembered that what Landy did to Brian was even worse .
You don ’ t get a sense of it in the movie , but it happened on a daily basis , for years . &amp; quot ; Al Jardine called the movie &amp; quot ; a great biography and pretty darn close to the way I remember it . &amp; quot ; Landy &amp; apos ; s son Evan has disputed the film &amp; apos ; s accuracy , believing that his father was unfairly portrayed . A few days after the film &amp; apos ; s wide distribution , Mike Love reported that he was waiting for a chance to see the film before offering his opinion .
He also addressed comments by Evan Landy , calling them &amp; quot ; very interesting because you get an intimate look at someone who was with Brian every day for a few years &amp; quot ; .
When asked if he were aware of any inaccuracies , he responded : &amp; quot ; That Melinda saved Brian from Dr .
Landy .
That was my brother &amp; # 91 ; Stan Love &amp; # 93 ; and Carl &amp; # 91 ; Wilson &amp; # 93 ; who stepped in .
Landy was , in fact , over-reaching . &amp; quot ; He also denied that he was ever verbally cruel to Brian : &amp; quot ; Total bull , a fallacy .
Brian and I had always been friends . &amp; quot ; Van Dyke Parks , who had not watched the film , expressed disappointment over its alleged omissions and stated : &amp; quot ; I ’ ve likened the bowed , secco 8th-note cello triplets in &amp; apos ; Good Vibrations &amp; apos ; ( my idea ) to the signature shot of the &amp; apos ; ruby slippers &amp; apos ; in &amp; quot ; The Wizard of Oz &amp; quot ; .
An audio tape in the Capitol Records &amp; apos ; archives reveals my voice &amp; # 91 ; at the session &amp; # 93 ; . . .
And nothing can explain the number of times one hears &amp; apos ; Count it off Van Dyke . &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; The film earned $ 2 . 1 million during its opening weekend , averaging $ 4,421 between 480 theaters ; eventually expanding to 792 theaters .
It went on to gross $ 12 . 6 million in the United States and Canada and $ 16 . 1 million in other territories for a total gross of $ 28 . 6 million . On Rotten Tomatoes , the film holds an approval rating of 91 % based on 196 reviews , with an average rating of 7 . 7 / 10 .
The site &amp; apos ; s critical consensus reads , &amp; quot ; As unconventional and unwieldy as the life and legacy it honors , &amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; should prove moving for Brian Wilson fans while still satisfying neophytes . &amp; quot ; On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 , based on 40 critics , indicating &amp; quot ; generally favorable reviews &amp; quot ; .
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &amp; quot ; A – &amp; quot ; on an A + to F scale . The film was well received at the 2014 Toronto Film Festival screening .
Audiences rose for a standing ovation , while early reviews unanimously lauded the film .
Among many music-related films shown at the Toronto Festival , &amp; quot ; The Wrap &amp; quot ; deemed &amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; the &amp; quot ; boldest &amp; quot ; of the crop , while &amp; quot ; The Washington Post &amp; quot ; proclaimed that it had &amp; quot ; stolen the show , &amp; quot ; comparing to its other films as &amp; quot ; an unexpected , undisputed triumph . &amp; quot ; The film continued to receive a positive reception at further screenings . The film was listed as one of the best movies of 2015 by &amp; quot ; TIME &amp; quot ; and by &amp; quot ; Rolling Stone &amp; quot ; who also deemed it &amp; quot ; one of the best music biopics ever &amp; quot ; .
Consequence of Sound said : &amp; quot ; Not since Anton Corbijn &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Control &amp; quot ; , his excellent 2007 retelling of the life and death of Ian Curtis and Joy Division , has a biopic felt so authentic and conditional of its own subject . &amp; quot ; NPR wrote in an analysis of recent music films : &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; makes a fascinating leap by suggesting that the Beach Boys auteur constructed his inimitable soundscapes as a way of dealing with auditory hallucinations – making pop songs that go deep , in part , because they were designed to converse with the voices in his head . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; The Hollywood Reporter &amp; quot ; reviewed it favorably , calling it &amp; quot ; a deeply satisfying pop biopic whose subject &amp; apos ; s bifurcated creative life lends itself to an unconventional structure … &amp; # 91 ; Cusack &amp; apos ; s &amp; # 93 ; effectiveness &amp; # 91 ; is &amp; # 93 ; limited only by his lack of a physical resemblance to the songwriter .
That will be a stumbling block for some fans , but those who can get beyond it will find a very fine film about a singular artist . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; awarded the film three stars out of five , praising Cusack and Dano &amp; apos ; s performances , but criticizing the film &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; neat &amp; quot ; portrayal of Wilson &amp; apos ; s mental illness and other aspects of his life .
&amp; quot ; IndieWire &amp; quot ; gave the film a B + and wrote that , while Landy &amp; apos ; s character lacked depth , &amp; quot ; It &amp; apos ; s fascinating to watch the songwriter dash frantically around the studio , orchestrating a dozen sounds into auditory unity that only he understands .
No matter what else happens in the plot , &amp; quot ; Love &amp; amp ; Mercy &amp; quot ; excels at placing the music front and center . &amp; quot ; An additional review by the publication wrote : &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; T &amp; # 93 ; he film has plenty of love and mercy for its subject , but also some edginess , in what is a fascinating look at one of popular music &amp; apos ; s most important and influential songwriters . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Maclean &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; took issue with the film &amp; apos ; s glorification of Wilson , claiming that it reduced from &amp; quot ; biography &amp; quot ; into &amp; quot ; hagiography &amp; quot ; , yet maintains &amp; quot ; the soundtrack is unimpeachable , and Pohlad offers a riveting look at how Wilson crafted such aural wonders as &amp; apos ; God Only Knows &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; Good Vibrations &amp; apos ; . &amp; quot ; The publication &amp; quot ; Biography &amp; quot ; felt that the film &amp; apos ; s source material &amp; quot ; inadvertently &amp; quot ; reiterates plot devices used by typical biopics , and that , &amp; quot ; For better or worse , Brian Wilson is suitably charismatic when he &amp; apos ; s absolutely bonkers and hearing voices , and relatively boring after he &amp; apos ; s supposedly cured by a new drug regimen and his wife &amp; apos ; s benevolence . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Grantland &amp; quot ; was less enthusiastic , writing that the film &amp; apos ; s characters were treated too graciously in contrast to Giamatti &amp; apos ; s Landy , in order for the 1980s scenes to remain interesting ; however , the treatment assures that &amp; quot ; the 1960s sequences work because they use the musician &amp; apos ; s damaged psyche as a creative spark &amp; quot ; , something which Dano excelled at during his performance .
On retrospect , &amp; quot ; Free Beacon &amp; quot ; s C . W .
Mahoney suggested that &amp; quot ; Unlike most critics , I found it a bit mawkish and only superficially adventurous , but it does have the perk of allowing the viewer to ponder just exactly what makes the great Paul Dano &amp; apos ; s face so utterly punchable . &amp; quot ;

St Mihangel &amp; apos ; s Church , Llanfihangel yn NhowynSt Mihangel &amp; apos ; s Church in the village of Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn is a former parish church now used as the chapel for RAF Valley in Anglesey , north Wales .
The date of the first church on the site is uncertain , but in 1862 the then-existing church was rebuilt .
St Mihangel &amp; apos ; s became the chapel for the nearby Royal Air Force base in 1998 , after the Church in Wales had ceased using it for services .
It was then extended by dismantling and reassembling another Anglesey church , St Enghenedl &amp; apos ; s , at the west end of the building . The church is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to &amp; quot ; buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them &amp; quot ; , in particular because it is regarded as &amp; quot ; a good example of a mid 19th-century church &amp; quot ; .
The church contains some stained-glass windows commemorating the work carried out at RAF Valley , including the RAF Search and Rescue units based there . St Mihangel &amp; apos ; s Church is set within a gated and walled churchyard at the side of the road in the village of Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn in Anglesey , north Wales .
It is dedicated to St Michael ( ) .
The village , which is about from the port town of Holyhead in the north-west of the island , takes its name from the church ; the Welsh word originally meant &amp; quot ; enclosure &amp; quot ; and then &amp; quot ; church &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; ‑ fihangel &amp; quot ; is a modified form of the saint &amp; apos ; s name . The date of the first church on this site is unknown ; writing in 1833 , the antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the church then on the site as &amp; quot ; an ancient and venerable structure &amp; quot ; that formed &amp; quot ; a conspicuous and interesting object for many miles round . &amp; quot ; St Mihangel &amp; apos ; s was largely rebuilt in 1862 by Henry Kennedy , architect of the Diocese of Bangor ; some of the earlier building , especially the east end , was reused in Kennedy &amp; apos ; s church .
St Enghenedl &amp; apos ; s Church , Llanynghenedl ( a disused Anglesey church ) was dismantled and &amp; quot ; faithfully reassembled &amp; quot ; at the west end of St Mihangel &amp; apos ; s in 1988 , to allow the building to serve as the chapel for RAF Valley , a nearby Royal Air Force base .
The orientation of St Enghenedl &amp; apos ; s was reversed in the process ; its former west end was joined to the west end of Kennedy &amp; apos ; s building , therefore St Enghenedl &amp; apos ; s east end now faces west .
The work was carried out by D of E Property Services Agency . Writing in 1847 , before Kennedy &amp; apos ; s rebuilding , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones described the church as small ( long , wide and high ) and of early Perpendicular character .
He said that the east window had a &amp; quot ; peculiar &amp; quot ; design , in that there was a shield-shaped section of window above and between the two main sections , perhaps designed to display a coat of arms . The present building is rectangular , using rubble masonry dressed with freestone ; the roof uses slates and stone copings .
The 19th-century part of the church is wider and higher than the 1988 extension .
The bellcote is in the middle of the roof , at the join between the two sections .
There is an annexe including a vestry at the western end of the north side of the extension .
The nave has three bays and the roof timbers are exposed .
The sanctuary is marked off by a step and a rail , and there is a 17th-century gravestone set into the floor in front of the sanctuary .
The extension has two bays , and the two parts are divided by an arcade of three round arches .
The church and annexe have separate entrances . The windows in the 19th-century part are topped with trefoils ( a stonework pattern of three overlapping circles ) and set into square frames .
The north wall has three windows , one with a single light ( or section ) and two with pairs of lights ; there are two windows on the south wall ( one with three lights , another with two ) as well as a blocked window at the east end of the wall .
The church &amp; apos ; s east window is a pointed arch with a lower section of three trefoil-headed lights and two smaller lights on top .
The windows in the extension are set into pointed arches . Most of the windows contain clear leaded glass , but some have stained glass .
In 2010 , a two-panel stained glass window depicting the work of the RAF Search and Rescue units at RAF Valley was dedicated by the RAF &amp; apos ; s Chaplain-in-Chief , Ray Pentland .
The window , which also commemorates the work of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute and the RAF Mountain Rescue Service , was created by Karen Newby – wife of a former RAF Valley station commander – and Lindsey Abbott .
Karen Newby also designed a window dedicated in 2001 to mark the work of 208 Squadron at RAF Valley .
Another stained glass window was added in 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of 4 Squadron . A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a rectangular font made of gritstone , of unknown date , and a memorial to a Sion Evan and his son Evan Jones , who died in 1790 and 1822 respectively .
A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded a chalice and paten made of Britannia metal ( a pewter alloy ) , and an electro-plated set of communion vessels .
It noted that the old silver communion service had been stolen . St Mihangel &amp; apos ; s has national recognition and statutory protection from unauthorised alteration as it has been designated a Grade II listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating &amp; quot ; buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them &amp; quot ; .
It was given this status on 5 April 1971 , and has been listed because it is regarded as &amp; quot ; a good example of a mid 19th-century church , built as part of a programme of reconstruction and restoration of Anglesey churches &amp; quot ; .
Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes &amp; quot ; the simplicity of its design , complementing the local late medieval idiom typical of the island . &amp; quot ;

Congratulations .

First released in Europe and North America on March 2014 , &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s New Island &amp; quot ; is the successor to the 1995 game &amp; quot ; Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi &amp; apos ; s Island &amp; quot ; and the 2006 game &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s Island DS &amp; quot ; , but chronologically takes place between them . The gameplay focuses on controlling Yoshi characters who must escort Baby Mario through a series of levels .
Like similar &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; quot ; games , the game features a hand-drawn art style , with level designs and backgrounds stylized as oil paintings , watercolors , and crayon drawings . The gameplay is similar to other &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s Island &amp; quot ; games , involving Yoshi needing to reach the goal at the end of each stage while protecting Baby Mario from enemies by throwing eggs as a weapon , and sometimes transforming into a vehicle .
There are six vehicle forms in the game : Hot Air Balloon , Helicopter , Jackhammer , Mine Cart , Bobsled , and Submarine .
They are controlled using the console &amp; apos ; s gyroscope .
A new feature to this game are Mega Eggdozers , larger than usual Yoshi eggs , which are able to hit and destroy some obstacles in the way , as well as Metal Eggdozers , which are slightly smaller and roll across terrain .
Yoshi obtains these by eating Giant and Metal Shy Guys , respectively .
Underwater stages , where Yoshi must walk on the seafloor , are another new addition .
If the player is having difficulty completing a stage , Yoshi can obtain Flutter Wings , which allow for indefinite hovering , and Golden Flutter Wings , which give Yoshi invincibility as well . &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s New Island &amp; quot ; takes place immediately following the events of &amp; quot ; Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi &amp; apos ; s Island &amp; quot ; , where a stork delivers twins Baby Mario and Baby Luigi to a couple in the Mushroom Kingdom assumed to be their parents .
The opening of &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s New Island &amp; quot ; reveals that the stork had delivered the babies to the wrong couple .
The stork reclaims the babies and sets off to locate their real parents , but is ambushed by Kamek in mid-flight .
Kamek captures the stork and Baby Luigi , but Baby Mario falls and reunites with the Yoshi clan on Egg Island , a floating island that was conquered by Baby Bowser .
Baby Mario can telepathically sense Baby Luigi &amp; apos ; s location ; the Yoshi clan agrees to escort Baby Mario across the island and rescue Baby Luigi .
Once Baby Mario and Yoshi make it to Baby Bowser &amp; apos ; s castle , Baby Bowser wakes up and jumps on Kamek who attempted to get Baby Mario and Yoshi out .
When Baby Bowser tries to ride Yoshi , Baby Bowser is defeated .
Kamek uses a Giant Magical Hammer to make Baby Bowser gigantic .
After defeating Giant Baby Bowser , Yoshi proceeds to rescue the captured stork and save Baby Luigi only to be met by Adult Bowser , who appeared after warping through space and time .
After Yoshi defeats Adult Bowser , Kamek once again uses a Giant Magical Hammer to make adult Bowser gigantic .
After defeating Adult Bowser , Yoshi once again comes to the stork and Baby Luigi , and the stork delivers Baby Mario and Luigi back to their true home .
The moving helping warp pipe , who helped Yoshi throughout the journey , is seen at the end is revealed to be adult Mario who also travelled back through time and space to help Yoshi to succeed and returns to his own timeline . &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s New Island &amp; quot ; was developed by Arzest , which consists of key members involved in the development of its predecessor &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s Island DS &amp; quot ; .
Masahide Kobayashi directed the game , and Takashi Tezuka was producer . The game was announced in a Nintendo Direct presentation in April 2013 .
Its official name was revealed at E3 2013 ; a trailer of the game was also featured .
&amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s New Island &amp; quot ; was released in both North America and Europe on March 14 , 2014 , and in Australia on March 21 .
It was released in Japan on July 24 , 2014 . &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s New Island &amp; quot ; has received mixed reviews , with its familiarity to &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s Island &amp; quot ; being met with both praise and criticism .
Among the most positive reviews came from Joystiq , giving it 4 out of 5 stars , and IGN , giving it a 7 . 9 out of 10 .
Giant Bomb &amp; apos ; s Patrick Klepeck was more mixed and rated it 3 out of 5 stars , stating &amp; quot ; at its core , &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s New Island &amp; quot ; is not a bad game .
This is an acceptable , middle-of-the-road platformer , and one that I had an OK time with .
But it &amp; apos ; s not particularly memorable until it &amp; apos ; s ready to say goodbye , and you &amp; apos ; re given a fleeting , tantalizing glimpse into the game that might have been . &amp; quot ; Conversely , Eurogamer &amp; apos ; s Chris Schilling was more critical .
Rating it 4 out 10 , Schilling criticized the game &amp; apos ; s visuals , soundtrack and pacing as well as Arzest themselves , stating that &amp; quot ; It &amp; apos ; s startling that a game so outwardly similar to the Super Nintendo original can be so very inferior . &amp; quot ; GameSpot &amp; apos ; s Tom Mc Shea , who rated it 5 out of 10 , echoed similar sentiments when discussing how &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s New Island &amp; quot ; s similarities with &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s Island &amp; quot ; were more of a hindrance than a boon .
Mc Shea further elaborated that while &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s Island DS &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; had its own problems , it also had an identity &amp; quot ; by citing that game &amp; apos ; s variety of babies and the unique abilities they possessed before concluding that &amp; quot ; Yoshi &amp; apos ; s New Island &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; has no such identity . &amp; quot ; Many reviewers have criticized the game for the use of the kazoo as a primary instrument . Despite receiving middling reviews from critics , the game was added to the Nintendo Selects label on October 16 , 2015 in Europe , and March 11th , 2016 in North America . The game debuted at number two in the Japanese sales charts , with 58,285 copies sold .
By October 2014 , it had sold 197,108 copies in Japan .

Jerry Richardson StadiumMcColl – Richardson Field at Jerry Richardson Stadium is a college football stadium in Charlotte , North Carolina , United States and the home field of the Charlotte 49ers football team representing the University of North Carolina at Charlotte ( UNC Charlotte ) .
The team became a Football Bowl Subdivision member in 2015 and competes in Conference USA . Proposed by the university &amp; apos ; s chancellor Phillip Dubois in 2008 , the stadium &amp; apos ; s construction was approved by the school &amp; apos ; s Board of Trustees , the Board of Governors for the University of North Carolina , and Governor Bev Perdue before officially beginning construction in April 2011 .
Businessmen Hugh McColl and Jerry Richardson purchased the naming rights to the facility &amp; apos ; s playing field in 2011 , and construction finished in October 2012 .
The stadium was named for Richardson in 2013 after an additional $ 10 million donation .
The stadium hosted its first major event on August 31 , 2013 , when the 49ers defeated the Campbell Fighting Camels . Designed by Jenkins · Peer Architects and the DLR Group , the horseshoe-shaped stadium has a capacity of 15,314 people .
Much of the current home side seating area is available with the purchase of a personal seat license .
The venue includes various amenities , such as the Judy W .
Rose football center , which includes athletic and academic facilities .
Located on the UNC Charlotte campus , parking is expected to be limited on game days , although public transportation routes to reach the stadium are currently under construction . In February 2008 , a university-appointed committee presented a report to UNC Charlotte Chancellor Phil Dubois recommending the addition of a football program at the school , which would cost approximately $ 11 . 5 million per year and would be funded primarily through an annually increasing student athletic fee .
In June 2008 , Dubois presented a report to the school &amp; apos ; s Board of Trustees addressing the potential impact of the addition of a football stadium on the university .
In the report , Dubois suggested two possible locations for a new stadium : a renovated Irwin Belk Track and Field Center / Transamerica Field or a new facility at the site of recreational fields on the northwestern part of the campus .
Dubois preferred the latter for cost reasons .
In November 2008 , the board unanimously approved Dubois &amp; apos ; proposal to add a football program . On December 11 , 2009 , the Board of Trustees approved a financing plan for football , which called for the university to borrow $ 40 . 5 million in state-issued bonds to construct a permanent football stadium and field house , citing a favorable bidding environment and greater interest in ticket sales as their reasons for building a new facility rather than expanding American Legion Memorial Stadium .
On February 12 , 2010 , the University of North Carolina Board of Governors approved a student fee increase to fund the construction of the facility .
Students pay an annual fee of $ 120 to fund the stadium &amp; apos ; s construction debt .
A separate fee , which will begin at $ 50 and increase annually until it reaches $ 200 , will pay for regular operating costs .
On August 2 , 2010 , North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue signed the debt service fee bill into law to clear the way for stadium construction .
The final design of the new stadium was displayed at the Board of Trustees meeting on September 24 , 2010 . Rodgers PCL Russell , a joint venture of Rodgers Builders , PCL Construction , and H .
J .
Russell &amp; amp ; Company , was the primary builder for the stadium and football center .
On April 28 , 2011 , UNC Charlotte held a groundbreaking ceremony for the new football stadium .
Construction finished in the fall of 2012 , and ownership was turned over to university control on October 31 , 2012 .
That month , the university announced its intent to make the stadium a zero waste facility . On November 1 , 2011 , the stadium &amp; apos ; s playing field was named McColl – Richardson Field after Hugh McColl , former chief executive officer of Bank of America , and Jerry Richardson , owner of the National Football League &amp; apos ; s Carolina Panthers , purchased the naming rights for an undisclosed amount .
Although athletic director Judy Rose stated that the school was asking for $ 5 million over 13 years for the naming rights to the stadium , the school announced on June 11 , 2013 , that Richardson had donated an additional $ 10 million to the school &amp; apos ; s football program , and the facility would be named Jerry Richardson Stadium .
The donation attracted some controversy , due to the fact that Richardson had recently lobbied the City of Charlotte for $ 87 . 5 million in public funds to renovate Bank of America Stadium .
Lighting for night games was installed starting on March 17 , 2015 .
Eight light poles were erected by Qualite Sports Lighting for $ 1 . 5 million .
On August 28 , 2015 , the promenade containing the university box , media box , broadcast booths and coaches ’ boxes ; was named for alumni Hunter and Stephanie Edwards . In December 2017 , it was reported that Richardson had engaged in &amp; quot ; workplace misconduct &amp; quot ; .
Sports Illustrated reported that &amp; quot ; at least four former Carolina Panthers employees have received &amp; quot ; significant &amp; quot ; monetary settlements due to inappropriate workplace comments and conduct by owner Jerry Richardson , including sexually suggestive language and behavior , and on at least one occasion directing a racial slur at an African-American Panthers scout . &amp; quot ; The future of the naming rights are now uncertain , as some groups have organized to change the name of the stadium . Four days after the venue passed inspection , the team hosted an informal scrimmage in front of approximately 1,500 spectators on November 3 , 2012 .
Two weeks later , 2,500 attendees watched the team &amp; apos ; s final scrimmage before its first season in 2013 .
The inaugural Green and White Spring Game was held on April 20 , 2013 ; the announced attendance at the game was 13,950 .
The stadium hosted its first major event when the 2013 Charlotte 49ers football team defeated the Campbell Fighting Camels 52 – 7 on August 31 , 2013 .
The announced official attendance for the game was 16,630 , setting an initial standing-room record for the venue .
The first intercollegiate points scored at the facility came when linebacker Mark Hogan ( who had previously been one of the first members of the Georgia State Panthers football program ) returned an interception for a touchdown on the second play from scrimmage .
The team &amp; apos ; s third home game , a 13 – 40 loss to the North Carolina Central Eagles , also had an announced attendance of 16,630 . Designed by Jenkins · Peer Architects and the DLR Group , the facility is covered with UNC Charlotte &amp; apos ; s unique brick style , called &amp; quot ; Morrocroft Special &amp; quot ; , from Hanson Brick .
To better align with the rest of the Charlotte Research Institute Campus , which was laid out to match Tryon Street , the stadium is slightly off of the traditional north – south alignment of most American football stadiums .
The Judy W .
Rose Football Center , named for the school &amp; apos ; s long-time athletic director , is located on the southeastern end of the facility .
The center includes various academic and athletic amenities .
The facility also includes of practice fields with a Bermuda sod grass turf , which are connected by a pedestrian bridge . The stadium is an under grade level horseshoe-shaped structure around a playing surface , which is covered with Matrix artificial turf .
The facility initially did not include floodlights , necessitating earlier kickoff times to avoid playing games at night until the 2015 season .
The stands currently seat 15,314 with bleacher seats taking up 13,586 .
A press box , named for donors Steve and Vicki Luquire , sits above the home side stands .
A scoreboard , which includes a video screen , is located behind the south end zone .
Two separate field-level video boards are tall .
Two identical statues by sculptor Jon Hair , titled &amp; quot ; Go Long &amp; quot ; , are located in front of the Judy Rose Football Center in the south endzone and at the main entrance of the stadium along the north endzone .
Both statues were made possible by Charlotte businessman and philanthropist Irwin &amp; quot ; Ike &amp; quot ; Belk , who has funded similar statues at the 49ers other sports venues , in addition to other works of art on campuses across the region .
Brass plaques are mounted to the statues &amp; apos ; brick pedestals with the names of the original FSL owners and others who contributed to the funding for construction of the facility . Home side seating is available with the purchase of a personal seat license fee for premium seating at games , which finances part of the stadium &amp; apos ; s construction .
Fans can purchase up to four of approximately 5,500 licenses for seats between the 30-yard line and each end zone with a minimum $ 250 annual donation to the athletic department or between the 30-yard lines on either side of midfield for $ 1,500 each year , plus the cost of season tickets .
Approximately 200 premium &amp; quot ; White Gold Tier &amp; quot ; seats , intended primarily for purchase by corporations , are also available for an undisclosed amount .
As of January 2013 , 600 seat licenses remained unsold . Jerry Richardson Stadium is located near the campus entrance at Highway 29 ( Tryon Street ) north of Hayes Stadium in Charlotte , North Carolina , United States .
The school has announced various measures to control traffic on game days , including the closure of all entrances to the campus 5 hours prior to kickoff .
Parking in designated lots around the campus on game days will be restricted to vehicles with an appropriate permit .
The Lynx Blue Line provides light rail service to the stadium via JW Clay Blvd / UNC Charlotte station . The stadium was designed to accommodate expansion sometime in the future .
This became more likely on May 4 , 2012 , when the school accepted an invitation to rejoin Conference USA , a Football Bowl Subdivision conference .
Possible changes to the stadium &amp; apos ; s structure from the expansion would include the addition of up to 24 luxury boxes and raising the stadium &amp; apos ; s capacity to 40,000 .
As of 2017 , the stadium has yet to undergo any expansions .

Northern vigorNorthern vigor is an effect seen in certain varieties of produce where varieties of plants grown in northern climates , then moved to southern climates , are hardier , better-producing , and better tasting .
This effect has been primarily observed in potatoes , but is also seen in strawberries and garlic .
The Saskatchewan Seed Potato Growers Association has trademarked the term &amp; quot ; Northern Vigour &amp; quot ; for use with their potatoes , but the effect is seen in produce grown throughout Canada and the northern United States . The exact cause of northern vigor is not known , but there are many theories .
Some believe it has to do with the length of the days in northern latitudes , or that it has to do with the combination of cold nights and hot days .
Others believe that the cold may kill off any disease that would otherwise affect plants from the south .
Still others think that the switch from a colder climate to a warm , less harsh environment makes it easier for the plants to thrive .
Researchers in Saskatchewan discovered that tubers raised in the cold and then moved to a warm environment undergo a series of physiological changes that may trigger more vigorous growth .
Freckled pike-congerThe freckled pike-conger ( &amp; quot ; Hoplunnis macrura &amp; quot ; ) , also known as the silver conger , is an eel in the family Nettastomatidae ( duckbill / witch eels ) .
It was described by Isaac Ginsburg in 1951 .
It is a marine , subtropical eel which is known from the western central Atlantic Ocean , including the Gulf of Mexico , Colombia , and towards the mouth of the Amazon River .
It dwells at a depth range of 55 – 310 metres .
Males can reach a maximum total length of 54 . 2 centimetres . Silver congers eat small marine fish and benthic invertebrates , such as shrimp and crabs . Hoplunnis macrura tends to live in deeper waters in subtropical environments .
These congers are non-burrowing organisms , nor do they live in wholes or cracks on sea floors or walls .
They live in areas where the sea floor is soft .
They are often found here the sea floor is soft .
Adult silver congers are known to inhabit the Gulf of Mexico , western Atlantic , along the South American coast , and the Caribbean Sea . Distribution among previously stated regions : Western Atlantic – along the west coast of the United StatesGulf of Mexico - from Florida Keys to Campeche , MexicoCaribbean Sea - the Honduran / Nicaraguan borderSouth America - From Columbia to the mouth of the Amazon River off of BrazilSilver Conger larvae have been collected off the coast of Barbados , North Carolina , and the Scotian Shelf . Silver conger eggs are pelagic .
They float in the water column in order to be fertilized and develop . Silver congers are slender-bodied and have a light yellowish- brown appearance with tiny spots on their dorsal side and black accents on their vertical fins .
They have overhanging jaws with which teeth of different sizes are visible when the mouth is closed .
There is an inner and outer row of teeth in their mouths .
The teeth of the bottom row tend to be larger than those on top .
They have a lateral line with 32-37 lateral line pores before the anus . There is no known importance of silver congers to humans .
They are harmless , not traded , and not used by humans .
Battle of the Campobasso ConvoyThe Battle of the Campobasso Convoy was a naval engagement between three British Royal Navy destroyers and an Italian &amp; quot ; Regia Marina &amp; quot ; torpedo boat which took place off Cape Bon in the Mediterranean sea on the night of 3 / 4 May 1943 .
The Italians were escorting the 3,566 Long tons transport ship &amp; quot ; Campobasso &amp; quot ; to Tunisia . As the North Africa campaign neared its conclusion , , and were patrolling the waters off Cape Bon .
On the night of 29 / 30 April , they made a sweep along the south coast of Sicily and sank a 2,000 ton merchant ship escorted by German E-boats , without damage or casualties to themselves . A few days later &amp; quot ; Nubian &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Petard &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Paladin &amp; quot ; from intelligence signals waited for an Italian convoy to cross their path .
The Italian 3,566 ton merchant &amp; quot ; Campobasso &amp; quot ; had left Pantelleria island loaded with bombs , land-mines , motor transport and other vital supplies to the beleaguered Axis force in Tunisia ; it was one of the last four convoys sent from Italy to Tunisia .
The merchant was then escorted by the Italian torpedo boat &amp; quot ; Perseo &amp; quot ; soon after departure . On the night of 3 / 4 May radar on the British destroyers picked up contacts heading towards the Tunisian coast .
The Italian torpedo boat &amp; quot ; Perseo &amp; quot ; , using the German Metox radar , picked up the emissions from the British destroyers and warned Italian high command that the convoy had been found . All three British destroyers at once attacked targeting the Italian merchantman &amp; quot ; Campobasso &amp; quot ; .
Hits were scored by 4-inch gun and &amp; quot ; pom-pom &amp; quot ; fire .
&amp; quot ; Campobasso &amp; quot ; was hit numerous times , set alight and within half an hour tremendous and continuous explosions took place as the ammunition and bombs were ignited .
The merchant sank quickly with the loss of 73 of the 103 men aboard , but &amp; quot ; Perseo &amp; quot ; responded and launched torpedoes to little effect ; the British destroyers found the range and bombarded &amp; quot ; Perseo &amp; quot ; .
She was soon set on fire and exploded , sinking within sight of the last Axis stronghold with the loss of 133 of the 216 men aboard , including naval personnel on passage and her commanding officer Lt .
Cdr .
Saverio Marotta , who refused to abandon his ship after being seriously wounded .
The next day the Italian hospital ship &amp; quot ; Principessa Giovanna &amp; quot ; picked up 4 survivors from &amp; quot ; Campobasso &amp; quot ; ( 20 more men from the steamer reached the coast in a lifeboat ) and 67 from &amp; quot ; Perseo . &amp; quot ; On 6 May the hospital ship was bombed and damaged by Allied aircraft , with 54 killed and 52 wounded . At dusk on 8 May , as part of Operation Retribution &amp; quot ; Paladin &amp; quot ; , with &amp; quot ; Jervis &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Nubian &amp; quot ; bombarded Kelibia , the most easterly point of the Cape Bon peninsula .
This bombardment was repeated at dawn the next day until all Axis forces surrendered in Tunisia .

Zurab Beridze ( swimmer ) Zurab Beridze ( ; born 9 January 1979 ) is a Georgian former swimmer , who specialized in sprint freestyle events .
After Georgia gained its independence from the Soviet Union in the early 1990s , Beridze became the first ever swimmer in history to represent his nation at the 2000 Summer Olympics .
While studying in the United States , he held the 50-yard freestyle time ( 20 . 89 ) , the second fastest in school &amp; apos ; s record books , and also played for the Western Illinois University &amp; apos ; s swimming and diving team under head coach Jerry Champer . Beridze competed only in the men &amp; apos ; s 50 m freestyle at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney .
Despite finishing among the top 25 swimmers from the European Championships in Helsinki , Finland , he received a ticket from FINA , under a Universality program , in an entry time of 24 . 13 .
He challenged seven other swimmers in heat three , including two-time Olympians Howard Hinds of the Netherlands Antilles and Emin Guliyev of Azerbaijan .
Racing on the outside lane , he faded down the stretch to pick up a third seed in 24 . 28 , a small fraction outside his entry standard .
Beridze failed to advance into the semifinals , as he placed fifty-fourth overall in the prelims .
Modified Stave NotationModified Stave Notation ( MSN ) is an alternative way of notating music that was developed in the UK where it is widely used .
MSN is intended to be used by people who cannot easily read ordinary musical stave notation ( or staff notation ) , even if it is enlarged , or for some people reduced in size .
Such users include those with visual impairments and those who are dyslexic . In the 1990s the then Royal National Institute for the Blind , negotiated with the Music Publishers &amp; apos ; Association an agreement to permit partially sighted people to enlarge music , providing only one copy was made and the enlarged music was not re-sold .
For each item enlarged , permission was needed from the work &amp; apos ; s publisher who would then supply a yellow sticker with &amp; quot ; MPA approved large print music copy RNIB &amp; quot ; written over a five line stave .
It was noted , however , at this time that enlargement produced new problems , notably with the extra space between symbols and the production of either unwieldy large and flimsy sheets or scores requiring more page turns and not necessarily in convenient places .
So examples of music in which all signs equally enlarged but compacted horizontally were created . Also in the 1990s some music publishers started producing music in large print fonts , taking layouts used widely for children &amp; apos ; s beginner tutor books and extending these to short repertoire pieces , particularly for keyboard instruments .
The National Music and Disability Information Service kept a resource paper &amp; quot ; RP14 Information on Music for People with Partial Sight &amp; quot ; which listed some of these publishers . With the advent of sophisticated music notation software , such as MuseScore , the production of MSN became easier , with the ability to save preferred settings of each user .
The Royal National Institute of Blind People is the largest formal producer of MSN in the world , with a production team based in Ivybridge , Devon .
MSN has become an accepted standard for public examinations in England and Wales , for GCSE and A level music and music technology papers , under general special arrangements authorised by the Joint Council for Qualifications , and worldwide for sight reading tests for grade examination boards such as the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music , and Trinity College London .
Candidates requiring Modified Print copies of the rubric may ask for MSN scores , sometimes in a standard format , sometimes tailor made to match a submitted example . Formalising standards for MSN in the UK involved : The work was underpinned by links with RNIB &amp; apos ; s general print guidelines for making information accessible for blind and partially sighted people , &amp; quot ; See it Right &amp; quot ; .
Reading music notation is more complex than reading prose involving complex eye movements .
Not only are there many symbols of different shapes and sizes , but the signs are placed in vertical as well as horizontal dimensions , some having effect for lines of music whilst others just apply to single features .
Often the reader needs to read &amp; quot ; in time &amp; quot ; rather than at his or her own speed , alongside the execution of complex physical skills to render the symbols into sound via an instrument .
Usually music is placed further away than ordinary print , allowing for an instrument to be placed between player and the printed music .
There may also be the need to see a musical director in the middle distance .
With eReading devices it is easy to obtain ordinary print consistently in one &amp; apos ; s preferred font size and type face .
However , stave notation comes in all kinds of densities , type faces and relative symbols size .
Modified Stave Notation can enable users to have consistent size and layout . Guidelines for the production of Modified Stave Notation are published by the UK Association for Accessible Formats ( UKAAF ) in document &amp; quot ; G009 UKAAF Modified Stave Notation meeting individual needs for large print music &amp; quot ; . The fundamentals of producing Modified Stave Notation are : In addition to the alteration of stave notation layout in MSN , other factors affecting accessibility include binding , colour of background paper ( as stave notation is conventionally in black ink ) and lighting .
The use of multimedia can also increase accessibility .
For example , the music seen can also be heard electronically with a variety of levels of &amp; quot ; interpretation &amp; quot ; from just the pitch and note lengths , to full nuance and stylistic detail .
Lastly , analysis and development of reading and memorisation techniques , pertinent to the user &amp; apos ; s requirements , may aid fluency . Some principles from RNIB &amp; apos ; s guidelines &amp; apos ; See It Right &amp; apos ; are transferred directly to stave notation in MSN .
The staves and note stem thickness correspond to a thickness of letters in 16 point typefaces .
Spaces between systems and between staves within a system are sufficiently large , although more use is made of left and right margins .
Text is sans serif , semi-bold or bold . Numerals are used in music for all kinds of purposes : in MSN page numbers are distinguished from bar numbers , by being placed in circles , for example .
In MSN the use of full size numerals for fingering rather than subscript size is a particular feature .
Fingering numbers are also often place in a horizontal line rather than dipping up and down to follow the contour of the melody , enabling a user to memorise the melody and then just follow the fingering numbers . The need for text to follow easily from column to column , page to page , is especially important in MSN where page turns need to occur where possible at a place where there are bars or at least at suitable musical breaks .
Many users of modified print materials read them with additional technological help , such as a closed circuit television screen : for this , the pages need to be able to lie flat .
Much music is written in portrait format , whereas landscape is preferred for MSN to reduce the number of times the reader has to track back to the beginning of a new system . MSN using music notation software enables dyslexic and partially sighted people who struggle to use the huge variety of formats of stave notation to have their music produced in a consistent layout , according to certain conventions , allowing more fluent use .

Cleo Rogers Memorial LibraryThe Cleo Rogers Memorial Library , also known as the Main Library , is the flagship library of the Bartholomew County Public Library system .
It includes a branch in Hope , Indiana , and a bookmobile that serves the county .
The building was designed by I .
M .
Pei &amp; amp ; Partners and constructed by Dunlap &amp; amp ; Company , completed in 1969 , and dedicated in 1971 .
It is notable for its design of red brick with concrete details and its Library Plaza , an urban space punctuated by the sculpture , &amp; quot ; Large Arch &amp; quot ; by Henry Moore .
It is named for Cleo Rogers ( 1905-1964 ) who was the county librarian for 28 years and assistant librarian for nine years . In 1899 a library in the county first began occupying two rooms inside the original Columbus City Hall at the southwest corner of Fifth and Franklin Streets .
The library &amp; apos ; s immediate popularity led the community to request funds from the well-known philanthropists , Andrew Carnegie , who was widely known for financing the construction of libraries throughout the United States .
While Columbus has always contained the main branch of the Bartholomew County system , a branch has existed in Hope , Indiana in various locations at the same time .
In 1966 a rented space was acquired on the town square and in 1998 a dedicated branch was opened that was designed by Deborah Berke &amp; amp ; Partners Architects . The first library in Bartholomew County stood on the corner of what was then Fifth and Mechanics Street ( Mechanics was later renamed to Lafayette Avenue ) .
This plot of land was donated to the county by Columbus resident Joseph I .
Irwin .
The original building was designed by John W .
Gaddis of Vincennes , Indiana and dedicated on June 1 , 1903 .
The construction cost was $ 19,200 with $ 15,000 coming from a donation from Andrew Carnegie and the remaining $ 4,200 obtained from taxation .
This library was then known as the &amp; quot ; Carnegie Library , &amp; quot ; but after 1923 became known as the &amp; quot ; Columbus-Bartholomew County Library &amp; quot ; with service to the entire county . By the late 1950s the needs of the county had outgrown the first building and required a larger library .
The project was funded by a $ 1 million bond and donations from the community , including an $ 800,000 grant from Cummins Engine Foundation .
However , this project was not directly part of the Cummins Foundation Architectural Program . From the beginning , the intention of the library and the plaza was to transform this part of the city so that it would positively affect the surrounding area and encourage residents to stay downtown .
The completion of this project also meant the demolition of the old library building and the closure of Lafayette Avenue between fifth and sixth . By the early 1960s a number of modern buildings by young architects had been built in Columbus through the Cummins Foundation Architectural Program , however this building was not one of those projects .
The Bartholomew County Library Association Board decided on their own to work with Pei . When Pei was offered the opportunity to build the library , he seized it in order to create a project that would transform the downtown area with the addition of a civic plaza in front of the library . The design and placement of the library , plaza , and sculpture directly relate to and recognize the design of First Christian Church ( designed by Eliel Saarinen and completed in 1942 ) , and the Irwin House , ( designed by Henry Ayling Phillips and completed in 1910 ) .
Pei felt that the project &amp; quot ; should occupy a space which would be quiet yet dignified ; that it be easily accessible to the great majority of people , both young and old ; that is location create an area of urban space , and that it take into consideration the future growth of the community and its character . &amp; quot ; Brick was used as the primary building material for the library , and as a traditional load bearing masonry system ; concrete and limestone is used as detailed elements .
This brick pavilion has solid walls on the east and west and has its main entrance off center at the west end .
The deeply recessed windows associated with the entrance are of a scale that relate to First Christian Church across the street , while the windows on the east end are shorter and relate to the scale of the sculpture and the Irwin house nearby . Inside the building the brick , concrete , and limestone details carry through .
The ceiling is a coffered concrete system with deep inset square elements that contain light fixtures . The Library Plaza was a significant part of Pei &amp; apos ; s design .
Before the Library Plaza was built there were few civic gathering spots in the city .
The first park in the city , known as Commercial Park , Central Park , and City Park , remained just east of the first Columbus City Hall on the site which is now part of the courtyard of the First Christian Church .
Pei believed that by creating the Library Plaza he would be creating the first &amp; quot ; truly urban space &amp; quot ; to Columbus . At the 1971 dedication , I .
M .
Pei spoke about the importance of the interrelationship between the parts of the Library Plaza : &amp; quot ; So here I am today very proud , and very happy to dedicate the Library , and also to dedicate the &amp; apos ; Large Arch &amp; apos ; , but more important than both of these is to be here to dedicate this open space , which is now yours .
Eliel Saarinen &amp; apos ; s church , our building here , Moore &amp; apos ; s &amp; apos ; Arch &amp; apos ; , Irwin &amp; apos ; s house , each is made more important by the presence of this open space , yet this open space is more than the sum of all of these . &amp; quot ; The same brick and concrete materials used on the library were used on the plaza .
Pei &amp; apos ; s hope was that the plaza would be compared to the vital public plazas of European cities .
For many years , the Library Plaza has been used for art fairs , concerts , and other community events including &amp; quot ; Popfest , &amp; quot ; which existed for 29 years . After 15 years , it was clear that library offerings needed to expanded .
Columbus-based architect James K .
Paris of Architect Group , Inc .
was chosen to make an addition to the back of the building in order to add the &amp; quot ; Indiana Room , &amp; quot ; which houses books relating to Columbus , Bartholomew County , the State of Indiana , and family history ; it also added room for the fiction collection and reference section . The addition was highlighted by the addition of a two-story glass covered atrium that joins the two buildings .
This addition occupies a space at the back of the building that was designed to be an outdoor courtyard . The Library Plaza was renovated to accommodate a wheelchair accessible ramp on the west side of the plaza .
This work was completed in a brick sympathetic to that which was used originally in the 1960s . By early 2012 , the Library Board began considering alterations to the plaza that would better connect the Columbus Area Visitors Center and the Library , and at the same time make the Library Plaza more inviting for visitors .
After considerable discussion and some revision through community meetings and discussions with Pei Cobb Freed &amp; amp ; Partners , a plan was created that preserved the original intentions of Pei .
In the end , this solution and process were celebrated by community leaders .
Xiphophorus malincheXiphophorus malinche , also known as highland swordtail , is a live bearing fish in the &amp; quot ; Poeciliidae &amp; quot ; family .
Its holotypes were found in Mexico .
This species is named after La Malinche , an Indian slave who played a role in the Spanish conquest as the interpreter , secretary , and mistress of Hernando Cortes . It is a species closely related to &amp; quot ; X .
cortezi &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; X .
birchmanni &amp; quot ; , with one zigzag horizontal stripe , a well-developed reticulum and males with a prominent bump on their head .
It has branched caudal fin rays , a distinctive vertical bar pattern and middorsal spotting .
Its sword has a dark ventral pigment and is distinctly upturned .
It also possesses a well-formed hook on its gonopodium .
Its grave spot is well developed ; it has yellow carotenoid pigments . It has melanophore spotting at the nodes of the reticulum .
In &amp; quot ; X .
malinche &amp; quot ; , females have oval pigmentation blotches .
Vertical bar patterns of X .
malinche males , however , are very irregular .
Many of the bars are of uneven thickness and sometimes slanted .
This irregularity varies from fish to fish , and from right to left sides of the same fish . This species exhibits atypical behavior for swordtails of the &amp; quot ; montezumae &amp; quot ; or &amp; quot ; cortezi &amp; quot ; groups .
In other species of these groups , mature males are usually found darting among and underneath rocks .
Males ( and females ) of &amp; quot ; X .
malinche &amp; quot ; were found in a shallow , sunny , sand-bottomed river under floating aquatic vegetation .
It is known to hybridise with Xiphophorus birchmanni . Rio Claro , Rio Moctezuma drainage , Pánuco River basin , Rio Calnali and Rio Conzintla .

Powernode 9080The PowerNode 9080 was a dual processor 32-bit Superminicomputer produced by Fort Lauderdale , Florida based electronics company Gould Electronics in the 1980s .
Its UTX / 32 4 . 3BSD Berkeley Unix-based operating system was one of the very first multi-processor shared memory implementations of Unix , although the processors operated in a Master-Slave configuration with a Mutual Exclusion ( MutEx ) lock on all Kernel IO resources .
Machines could be configured for either single or dual processor operation . The machine itself was housed in a number of 19 inch rack cabinets and the main CPUs consisted of 18 boards of ECL logic .
The resulting system was capable of benchmark performances up to 20 MIPS , a very high rating at the time .
The PowerNode systems were a very close relative of Gould &amp; apos ; s real time computer systems running their proprietary MPX real time operating system .
Only about two boards differed between the Unix-running PowerNode machines and the MPX-running real time machines .
The most significant of these was the Memory Management board which had virtual memory mapping abilities in the Unix-variant but not in the real-time variant . A smaller model of the PowerNode was also available in the form of the Gould PowerNode 6032 and 6040 systems which achieved a 7 MIPS performance similar to the contemporary DEC VAX-11 / 780 and VAX-11 / 785 . The PowerNode series was replaced by the Gould NP-1 series .
When Gould was purchased by Nippon Mining , the computer division was divested on the instructions of the US Government for National Security concerns and became part of Encore Computer .

Dedication 5Dedication 5 is a mixtape by American rapper Lil Wayne .
The mixtape was released on September 1 , 2013 .
It is the fifth installment of Lil Wayne &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Dedication &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; series , following its predecessors &amp; quot ; The Dedication &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Dedication 2 &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Dedication 3 &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Dedication 4 &amp; quot ; .
It &amp; apos ; s also the fifth installment of Lil Wayne &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Gangsta Grillz &amp; quot ; series .
The mixtape features guest appearances from The Weeknd , Chance the Rapper , Jae Millz , Future , Birdman , Mack Maine , T . I . , Vado and Kidd Kidd among others . On June 10 , 2013 Lil Wayne released a freestyle over Ace Hood &amp; apos ; s hit ” Bugatti ” instrumental featuring fellow Young Money artist Boo , which was later confirmed to be the first song from &amp; quot ; Dedication 5 &amp; quot ; .
Later that day DJ Drama confirmed on his Twitter that the mixtape is coming by stating : &amp; quot ; Yup .
D5 .
Tunechi .
Dram .
YM .
Stay tuned .
But pleaaaase . . .
b patient . &amp; quot ; hinting that the mixtape was still in development . Mack Maine intensified the topic when he tweeted &amp; quot ; D5 &amp; quot ; hinting the tape would be soon released .
On August 14 , 2013 , Lil Wayne hinted on his Twitter account that the mixtape would be finished in 10 days after he was asked by a fan .
On August 25 , 2013 , it was announced the mixtape would be released on August 30 , 2013 .
The mixtape was later pushed back two days and was released on September 1 , 2013 , at 12AM PST .
The graphic artwork of Dedication 5 was made by the graphics team OllyCarterzGFX ( Olly Tas and Abidul Ahad ) . &amp; quot ; Dedication 5 &amp; quot ; was met with mixed reviews from music critics .
William E .
Ketchum III of HipHopDX gave the mixtape a positive review , saying &amp; quot ; To Wayne ’ s credit , &amp; quot ; Dedication 5 &amp; quot ; is the best the series has showcased since its legendary sequel from seven years ago , even if it pales in comparison .
Occasionally , the YMCMB head honcho shows that he still has a portion of the skills that earned him his spot among rap ’ s elite .
If he can find recapture the consistency from that same era , he won ’ t have to apologize to his fans for much longer . &amp; quot ; Brian Josephs of &amp; quot ; XXL &amp; quot ; gave the mixtape an L , saying &amp; quot ; Surprisingly , one of the more intriguing moments of &amp; quot ; Dedication 5 &amp; quot ; comes in a skit .
On one of the final tracks , Lil Wayne is asked if he considers himself a living legend .
He doesn ’ t know , but he concludes by saying being Lil Wayne is “ amazing . ” Is this just contentment or a positive outlook on things to come , like the entertaining , but flawed &amp; quot ; Dedication 5 &amp; quot ; is ? Fans could speculate , but it ’ s much easier to realize how refreshing it is to hear Lil Wayne sounding like he gives a damn . &amp; quot ; Corban Goble of Pitchfork Media gave the mixtape a 5 . 1 out of 10 , saying &amp; quot ; Though he ’ s still got an ear for the beat and can manipulate his flow to fit-- and , again , most of these bars are rapped without rehearsal , so adjust your mindset accordingly-- &amp; quot ; Dedication 5 &amp; quot ; is uneven , front-heavy , and too long for one sitting .
But with both recent mixtapes as well as recent projects , Wayne has set the bar very low .
What more can he say ? It ’ s hard to know until the artist himself decides , but &amp; quot ; Dedication 5 &amp; quot ; -- a release whose DatPiff page earnestly reads &amp; quot ; Welcome back Mixtape Weezy ” -- shows that some gears are still moving . &amp; quot ; Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound gave the album three and a half stars out of five , saying &amp; quot ; In just a few words , Wayne lends all sorts of gravity to claims that he wants to get better and to do away with the laziness , fear , and negativity of recent years .
He ’ s got a long way to go before he ’ s ever the Best In The World again , but he ’ s nothing if not totally , totally … committed .
Good to have ya back , Mr .
Carter . &amp; quot ; Adam Finley of PopMatters gave the mixtape a six out of ten , saying &amp; quot ; Medical troubles , legal troubles , self-doubt , the crushing weight of expectation – any one of those on its own could cripple an artist .
Wayne has stumbled hard in recent years , but with &amp; quot ; Dedication 5 &amp; quot ; he seems to have temporarily caught himself .
He even apologized to fans on Twitter recently and promised to work harder .
&amp; quot ; Dedication 5 &amp; quot ; is not the best Lil Wayne mixtape ever .
It ’ s not even in the Top 5 , but it is the best that he ’ s released in four years .
More importantly , it ’ s evidence that Mixtape Weezy still exists in some form , if Wayne can stop cashing checks and doing skateboard tricks long enough to let him out . &amp; quot ; On December 23 , 2013 , &amp; quot ; XXL &amp; quot ; ranked it at number 16 on their list of the best mixtapes of 2013 .

Robert LeonhardtRobert Leonhardt ( 1877 – February 2 , 1923 ) was an operatic baritone who sang several notable roles with the New York Metropolitan Opera between 1913 and 1922 .
He made numerous recordings for major record labels , both in Europe and in the United States . Leonhardt was born in 1877 in Linz .
His operatic debut was in 1898 , in Linz .
For four years he found permanent employment at the German Theatre in Prague starting in 1905 .
Specializing in Wagnerian roles , he sang at Brün from 1909 to 1911 , and from 1911 until 1913 with the Vienna Volksoper while also guesting with the Vienna Imperial Opera in 1909 and the Berlin Gura Summer Opera in 1910 .
In October 1913 it was announced that Leonhardt had joined the New York Metropolitan opera .
Sailing from Bremen , he endured a difficult voyage before arriving in the U . S .
on November 6 .
He first appeared on stage for his new employer in December in the role of Peter in Engelbert Humperdinck &amp; apos ; s opera &amp; quot ; Hänsel und Gretel &amp; quot ; .
Receiving critical acclaim for his work in this role , he would appear in Met productions over the course of the next nine years .
He was expected to appear in an expanded role at the met , but world circumstances would prevent this .
Beginning in December 1917 he billed himself as &amp; quot ; Robert Leonard &amp; quot ; to distance himself from his Germanic heritage .
Nevertheless , Leonhardt , a citizen of Austria , was dropped by the New York Met in April 1918 because of his status as an enemy alien despite continued critical praise .
The opera &amp; apos ; s manager , Mr .
Gatti , expressed his regret at having to make such a move .
Leonhardt &amp; apos ; s wife and children resided in Vienna for the duration of the war .
After the war his employment recommenced with the Met and he was performing on stage again as of November 1920 .
Here he continued to perform until shortly before his death .
He developed an illness that lasted for some time , and never recovered .
Robert Leonhardt died at St .
Mark &amp; apos ; s Hospital in New York City on February 2 , 1923 . Reviews of Leonhard &amp; apos ; s performances are wide-ranging .
He has been noted for a &amp; quot ; dark , steely , throaty bass &amp; quot ; with mundane performance , although this is perhaps due to Leonhard being out of his voice &amp; apos ; s comfort zone regarding range .
Conversely , he was noted for having a &amp; quot ; luscious and lovely Italian voice &amp; quot ; with a splendid , spontaneous sense of humor . Leonhardt &amp; apos ; s career are a recording artist may be more important than his performing career .
He recorded many popular songs , as well as operatic arias .
His recording career began in 1900 for the Gramophone Company , recording prolifically for them through 1905 .
Many of these recordings were issued in the Standard German Catalogue .
Several European recordings also appeared on the International Zonophone and Homokord labels .
From 1903 to 1905 he also made records for the European Columbia branch .
He recorded cylinders for the Edison company before coming to the United States , and these were marketed in the U . S .
to the German-speaking population .
After changing his residency to the United States , he continued his recording career with Columbia Records from 1915 through 1920 .
Although promoted as from the &amp; quot ; Metropolitan Opeara Co . &amp; quot ; , not all of his recordings were operatic and like the Edison cylinders , his records were marketed to German-speaking Americans , in their E-prefix ethnic catalog , and not to the general public .
An exception is Record # A2053 , to which the prestigious tri-color banner label was applied .
This record was released in 1916 , and an announcement was made in the English-speaking trade press , but no other records by Leonhardt appeared in this series .
His final recordings were made for Victor in 1921 and 1922 , also released in their ethnic series .
Collectors of operatic recordings were instructed to seek out these ethnic selections of Leonhardt &amp; apos ; s . note : All Columbia listings are U . S .
releases .

ColorTymeColorTyme is an American rent-to-own business , currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Rent-A-Center . In 1994 , the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in &amp; quot ; Miller v .
ColorTyme &amp; quot ; that the lease agreements offered by ColorTyme were covered under the state &amp; apos ; s Consumer Credit Sales Act , and that the lease agreements were therefore not leases but sales on credit .
The court further held that the company was charging usurious rates of interest to its customers .
A similar lawsuit , filed by the office of Wisconsin Attorney General James E .
Doyle in 1993 , resulted in the company being fined $ 25,000 and required to disclose interest rates and other credit terms to consumers .
ColorTyme later settled a class action lawsuit brought by the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee by agreeing to pay $ 2 . 9 million , including $ 675,000 in interest-free loans to low-income individuals and families .
Trinidad and Tobago Securities and Exchange CommissionThe Trinidad and Tobago Securities and Exchange Commission ( TTSEC ) is the sole regulator of the securities industry in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago .
The Commission came into being as a result of the proclamation of the Securities Industry Act in 1997 .
The Commission ’ s role is to foster the orderly development of the securities market . The Securities Industry Act 1995 ( SIA , 1995 ) is the Act by which the Trinidad and Tobago Securities and Exchange Commission was established .
In December 2012 , the SIA 1995 was repealed and replaced by the Securities Act ( SA 2012 ) “ an Act to provide protection to investors from unfair , improper or fraudulent practices ; foster fair and efficient securities markets and confidence in the securities industry in Trinidad and Tobago ; to reduce systemic risk and for other related matters ” .
The Act was proclaimed by His Excellency , The President of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on December 28 , 2012 and came into operation on December 31 , 2012 . In late 2009 a Draft Securities Bill ( “ Draft Bill ” ) was laid in Parliament for debate .
On December 14 , 2009 the Commission submitted an application to the International Organisation of Securities Commissions ( “ IOSCO ” ) to become a signatory to the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding ( “ MMoU ” ) .
In May 2010 , the Bill was before a Joint Select Committee of the Senate when Parliament was dissolved and General Elections were subsequently announced .
By way of letter dated October 18 , 2010 , IOSCO informed the Commission that its application to become a signatory to the IOSCO MMoU was reviewed and the Commission was accepted to be listed on Appendix B .
In November 2010 , the Bill was re-laid before the Joint Select Committee of the Senate .
At the IOSCO conference in May 2011 , members were informed that by December 31 , 2012 , the Appendix B listing would cease to exist .
Additionally , IOSCO further emphasised that it will no longer allow the two-tiered system of membership which currently exists with some members being on the A list and others on the B list .
With effect from January 1 , 2013 , IOSCO ’ s membership will be strictly based on the country ’ s capacity to meet the requirements associated with being on what is currently IOSCO ’ s A list .
As a result , the decision was made to allow the Bill to lapse in June 2011 in order to provide the Commission with the opportunity to redraft the Bill so as to become compliant with the IOSCO requirements .
After this process was completed the Securities Bill , 2012 was laid in Parliament in November 2012 and the Securities Act , 2012 came into force on December 31 , 2012 .
The Commission became a Full Signatory to the IOSCO MMoU on June 19 , 2013 . The SA 2012 provides for the appointment of no more than nine and no fewer than five Commissioners to the Board of the Commission .
The present Board consists of seven Commissioners led by current Chairman , Professor Patrick Watson , who was appointed as Chairman of the Trinidad and Tobago Securities and Exchange Commission on January 30 , 2012 . The Commission has four primary functions : Other divisions which support the Commission ’ s mandate are :
Wibbel the Tailor ( play ) Wibbel the Tailor ( German : Schneider Wibbel ) is a comedy play by the German writer Hans Müller-Schlösser which was first performed in 1913 .
The play takes place in Müller-Schlösser &amp; apos ; s hometown of Düsseldorf during its occupation by French troops during the Napoleonic Wars .
From 1913 to 1956 , there were fifteen hundred performances of the play in Germany with actor Paul Henckels in the role of Wibbel .
Four feature films and an opera have been based on Müller-Schlösser &amp; apos ; s play , and the character of Anton Wibbel has become a popular symbol of Düsseldorf . According to the author , the story goes back to a true story in Berlin from the time of Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm IV .
A master baker had been involved in a drunken knife fight , and had been sentenced to several weeks in jail .
The baker persuaded his journeyman assistant to serve the jail sentence in his stead .
However , the journeyman dies in prison , and the baker is declared dead .
When this becomes known , the Kaiser pardons the baker . For his play , Müller-Schlösser changed the setting to his hometown of Düsseldorf at the &amp; quot ; period of the French occupation &amp; quot ; following Napoleon ’ s conquest of the region in the early 1800s .
The baker became Wibbel , a master tailor .
While inebriated , Wibbel had insulted the Emperor Napoleon and been sentenced to a jail term .
Again , Wibbel persuades his journeyman to serve his sentence , and the journeyman dies while imprisoned .
As Wibbel and his wife Fin watch his own funeral from their window , Wibbel remarks ( in dialect ) &amp; quot ; Nä , watt bin ich für ’ ne schöne Leich &amp; quot ; ( literally , &amp; quot ; Well , I am a beautiful corpse ” ) .
This line from the play has become famous .
After a period in hiding , Wibbel returns to his life by claiming to be his own twin brother , and marries his wife Fin .
When the French forces withdraw from Düsseldorf , he announces the deception . The play was a popular hit , and spawned a large number of adaptations such as the 1938 opera &amp; quot ; Tailor Wibbel &amp; quot ; by Mark Lothar and several films including :
The Doctor ( 2013 film ) The Doctor is a 2013 film documenting the life of former American Basketball Association ( ABA ) and National Basketball Association ( NBA ) player and Hall of Fame inductee Julius Erving .
It premiered on NBA TV on June 10 , 2013 .

Shovel KnightShovel Knight is a 2D side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Yacht Club Games .
Following a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign , the game was released for Microsoft Windows , Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in June 2014 .
The game was ported to OS X and Linux in September 2014 , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation Vita and Xbox One in April 2015 , Amazon Fire TV in September 2015 , and Nintendo Switch in March 2017 .
&amp; quot ; Shovel Knight &amp; quot ; is inspired by gameplay and graphics of platformer games developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System .
The game has received critical acclaim and won various awards .
Following the release of additional campaigns , the original story received the retronym &amp; quot ; Shovel of Hope &amp; quot ; .
The full game is referred to as Shovel Knight : Treasure Trove , which includes two other campaigns : &amp; quot ; Plague of Shadows &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Specter of Torment &amp; quot ; .
A fourth campaign called &amp; quot ; King of Cards &amp; quot ; is in development , and is planned for release in the second half of 2018 . &amp; quot ; Shovel Knight &amp; quot ; is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with an 8-bit graphical style in which players control the eponymous protagonist as he collects treasure and fights against the Order of No Quarter .
Shovel Knight &amp; apos ; s main means of attack is his shovel , which he can either use to attack enemies head on and dig up treasure , or aim below him whilst jumping to bounce on enemies , similar to the pogo jump from &amp; quot ; DuckTales &amp; quot ; or the downward thrust from &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; .
By finding a salesman hidden in most levels , the player can purchase secondary items that can be used with a limited supply of magic .
These include long-range projectiles , gloves that can punch through dirt blocks , and a locket that makes the player invincible for a brief period . Aside from the main quest , which involves fighting through each level and defeating the boss at the end in order to progress through the world map , players are encouraged to collect as much treasure as possible .
Treasure can be obtained by defeating enemies , finding chests , digging through the environment , and finding note sheets which also unlock music tracks .
Any money earned can be spent in villages on various items , such as upgrades to health and magic , secondary items sold by the salesman , and armor and shovel upgrades that grant bonus skills .
While the player does have infinite lives , dying will cause the player to lose some of their money , though the player can recover it by collecting the flying sacks that appear around where the player last died .
For added challenge , players can also choose to destroy checkpoints to earn more treasure at the risk of being sent back further should they die . Completing the game opens up a New Game Plus mode , which increases the overall difficulty of the game by doubling the damage Shovel Knight takes , as well as limiting the number of checkpoints in a stage , though the player retains any relics and health and magic upgrades collected during their first playthrough .
There is also a password system allowing players to input codes to unlock various cheats . There are some gameplay features unique to certain versions of the game .
Both the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U versions allow players to use their respective touch screens to switch between secondary items without pausing the game .
The Nintendo 3DS version features an exclusive mode known as StreetPass arena .
This involves the player recording a short section of movement , with the goal of collecting as many gems as possible , which is then distributed to other players via StreetPass , where they can fight against that player &amp; apos ; s recorded character .
Additionally , a Shovel Knight Amiibo figure , released on December 11 , 2015 in Europe and January 8 , 2016 in North America , allows players to unlock a co-op mode in the Wii U version , as well as challenge stages and customizable gear in Wii U , 3DS , and Nintendo Switch versions .
Additional Amiibo figures based on Plague Knight , Specter Knight , and King Knight have been announced which , along with the Shovel Knight Amiibo figure , also unlock in-game fairies that accompany the player in certain campaigns and an additional armor for Specter Knight .
The PlayStation versions of the game feature an exclusive boss battle against &amp; quot ; God of War &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; nowiki &amp; gt ; &amp; apos ; s &amp; lt ; / nowiki &amp; gt ; Kratos , while the Xbox One and PC versions features a fight with the &amp; quot ; Battletoads &amp; quot ; . On January 11 , 2017 , it was revealed that the co-op feature , previously exclusive to the Wii U release , would become available on all platforms , excluding the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita . Free post-release expansion DLC gives players additional campaigns starring different playable characters .
Following the update to &amp; quot ; Treasure Trove &amp; quot ; , the &amp; quot ; Specter of Torment &amp; quot ; campaign was made available as a standalone purchase .
Expansions also contain additional challenges for Shovel Knight , co-op mode , and a mode that allows the player to choose the gender of major characters in &amp; quot ; Shovel of Hope &amp; quot ; , called Body Swap mode .
The first expansion , &amp; quot ; Plague of Shadows &amp; quot ; , puts players in the role of Plague Knight , who uses bombs in place of Shovel Knight &amp; apos ; s shovel .
Players can customize the properties of Plague Knight &amp; apos ; s bombs by changing the casing , which affects how they are thrown ; the powder , which affects what happens when they explode ; and the fuse , which determines when they explode .
By holding down the attack button , Plague Knight can perform a Burst move to launch himself in the air .
Players can also unlock arcanas containing helpful spells by finding Shovel Knight &amp; apos ; s items and trading them with Chester the salesman .
Additional items can be unlocked by collecting green coins hidden throughout each level .
Plague Knight &amp; apos ; s levels are similar to Shovel Knight &amp; apos ; s , but his different and more technical moveset makes playing the game significantly different .
The second expansion , &amp; quot ; Specter of Torment &amp; quot ; , allows players to control Specter Knight who is able to briefly run up walls .
When Specter Knight is close enough to an enemy , he can perform a diagonal slash launching him upwards or downwards , allowing him to reach new areas .
Collecting red skulls hidden throughout each level can unlock Curios ( items similar to Shovel Knight &amp; apos ; s relics ) that Specter Knight can use .
A third and final expansion , &amp; quot ; King of Cards &amp; quot ; , is planned sometime for 2018 and will feature King Knight as its protagonist .
King Knight is able to use a bash attack and spinning jump to attack enemies and conquer obstacles .
The campaign will also feature a strategic card battle mini-game . Prior to the game , adventurers Shovel Knight and Shield Knight journeyed across the world alongside one another , but while exploring the Tower of Fate , a cursed amulet takes over Shield Knight and leaves Shovel Knight stranded outside of the sealed tower .
Grieving for his beloved , Shovel Knight gives up adventuring and goes into self-imposed exile .
During his absence , the Enchantress rises to power , spreading evil across the land .
Upon hearing that the Enchantress has unsealed the Tower of Fate , Shovel Knight begins his journey back to it , hoping to find and rescue Shield Knight .
In order to do so , Shovel Knight must fight the members of &amp; quot ; The Order of No Quarter , &amp; quot ; who have been dispatched by the Enchantress to impede him . There are eight members of the Order ; King Knight , Specter Knight , Treasure Knight , Mole Knight , Plague Knight , Polar Knight , Propeller Knight and Tinker Knight .
Furthermore , Shovel Knight &amp; apos ; s rival , Black Knight , attempts to keep Shovel Knight from reaching the Tower of Fate but does not answer to the Enchantress .
After defeating each member of the Order , Shovel Knight reaches the Tower of Fate , where he faces Black Knight again .
It is revealed that the Enchantress is actually a dark spirit inhabiting the amulet that cursed Shield Knight , possessing her body .
Black Knight , who held romantic feelings for Shield Knight but lost her hand to Shovel Knight , had been protecting her in an effort to keep Shovel Knight from harming her . While ascending the tower , Shovel Knight unwittingly falls into the midst of the members of the Order Of No Quarter as they eat dinner .
They demand a rematch , and Shovel Knight duels each knight one by one atop the banqueting table .
Emerging victorious over them once again , Shovel Knight may help them up , reeling in the chain onto which the defeated knights are clinging . Reaching the top , Shovel Knight faces the Enchantress and battles her .
He manages to exorcise the evil spirit , turning her back into Shield Knight .
After being separated from Shield Knight , the Enchantress transforms into a powerful specter , known as the Remnant of Fate , which Shovel Knight and Shield Knight defeat together .
In a desperate final maneuver , the Remnant of Fate attempts to kill the two knights , but Shield Knight holds the attack at bay as Black Knight comes in and carries the wounded Shovel Knight to safety before the tower collapses . In the aftermath , Black Knight leaves the unconscious Shovel Knight by his campfire and departs , fulfilling his promise to Shield Knight to save him , as the credits show the eventual fate of each member of the Order Of No Quarter .
A post-credits scene shows Shield Knight , who managed to escape the tower &amp; apos ; s destruction , limping towards the campfire before lying down next to Shovel Knight as he sleeps . Running parallel to &amp; quot ; Shovel of Hope &amp; quot ; , Plague Knight plots his own scheme , planning to steal essence from Shovel Knight and the other Order members to use as ingredients in the ultimate potion , capable of granting any one desire of its user .
He is aided by several other characters from Shovel Knight &amp; apos ; s campaign , such as Mona the witch , who pursues alchemy in secret due to the rest of the world fearing and rejecting it . One by one , Plague Knight steals each of the others &amp; apos ; essences before moving on to the Tower of Fate .
As Plague Knight obtains the Enchantress &amp; apos ; s essence and begins to finish the potion , Black Knight and Mona arrive and try to stop him .
Plague Knight reveals that his intention was always to use the potion to win Mona &amp; apos ; s heart , but she confesses she already loves him .
Plague Knight attempts to stop the reaction , but it goes out of control , creating a dark version of Plague Knight . The real Plague Knight defeats the shadow and stabilizes the potion , but realizing he already has everything he could ever want in Mona , the two decide to use the potion to destroy the Tower of Fate .
As a result , the villagers hail Plague Knight and his alchemists as heroes , finally accepting them .
In a post-credits scene , Plague Knight and Mona are seen sharing a dance together in the laboratory . Prior to the events of &amp; quot ; Shovel of Hope &amp; quot ; , Specter Knight is sent to recruit knights to join the Enchantress &amp; apos ; s Order of No Quarter .
As he recruits the knights , he experiences memories of his former life : Before dying , he was an adventurer named Donovan , who adventured alongside his partner , Luan .
The two scale the Tower of Fate and find the amulet within , but they run into Shield Knight , who tries to stop them .
In the skirmish , the floor beneath them collapses and they fall , killing Luan and leaving Donovan mortally wounded .
Shield Knight , now corrupted into the Enchantress , offers to save Donovan in exchange for gathering eight knights for her .
He agrees , and the Enchantress kills and resurrects him into the undead Specter Knight .
She presents him with a locket , telling him that with each knight that joins the order , it will be imbued with power , with a fully powered locket capable of bringing him back to life . Partway through his quest , a boy named Reize Seatlan breaks into the Tower of Fate , hoping to defeat the evil within .
Seeing his potential , the Enchantress fills him with dark energy , corrupting him like herself despite Specter Knight &amp; apos ; s protests .
Once seven knights have been recruited , Black Knight breaks in and reveals the Enchantress is Shield Knight .
Seeking revenge and hoping to save Reize , Specter Knight goes after the Enchantress .
Upon his arrival , the Enchantress summons Reize and fills him with more dark energy , turning him into a giant phantom .
Specter Knight defeats Nightmare Reize , but the Enchantress decides to make Reize her eighth knight .
Specter Knight demands he is made the last knight in Reize &amp; apos ; s place , and uses the locket to restore Reize to life instead . With the full Order assembled , the Enchantress &amp; apos ; s forces begin their siege and take over the land , while Specter Knight returns Reize to his village , where he will be safe .
Now bound to the Enchantress , he laments to Black Knight that he fears she will never be stopped .
In a post-credits scene , Specter Knight reminisces over the locket , revealed to have been a keepsake given to him by Luan , who asks Donovan to protect his son , Reize . &amp; quot ; King of Cards &amp; quot ; is another prequel in which King Knight must defeat the &amp; quot ; Three Kings &amp; quot ; who rule over the land and become the true monarch .
On the genesis of the game designer Nick Wozniak had stated that the idea started out as &amp; quot ; sort of as a joke conversation over lunch that kind of got too serious . &amp; quot ; The team had already planned to make a game in the style of the NES classics that they grew up on , and eventually the sword-thrust move from &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; was brought up as a move that both designers liked .
They soon thought that this move would be better suited in their game for a shovel as opposed to a sword , and the idea of Shovel Knight was born .
Besides &amp; quot ; Zelda II &amp; quot ; , other specific inspirations include &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; DuckTales &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Super Mario Bros .
3 &amp; quot ; , and the &amp; quot ; Mega Man &amp; quot ; titles .
The game is also influenced by &amp; quot ; U . N .
Squadron &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Dark Souls &amp; quot ; .
The game was announced on March 17 , 2013 alongside the launch of a Kickstarter campaign to fund development , with a minimum funding goal of $ 75,000 .
The campaign reached this goal in late March and went on to collect a total of $ 311,502 , fulfilling all announced stretch goals for additional features , by its end on April 13 .
Additional features earned through Kickstarter stretch goals include a four-player battle mode , a mission-based challenge mode , an additional mode that swaps all the characters &amp; apos ; genders , and additional playable story campaigns for three boss characters .
These features will be added as free updates to the game in the future .
To promote the Kickstarter , Yacht Club distributed copies of their initial Penny Arcade Expo demo to several prominent gaming personalities on YouTube , including &amp; quot ; Two Best Friends Play &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Game Grumps &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; Shovel Knight &amp; quot ; features a chiptune soundtrack in the style of older video game titles from the NES era and were composed by Jake Kaufman , with two contributions by &amp; quot ; Mega Man &amp; quot ; composer Manami Matsumae .
The game &amp; apos ; s soundtrack was released for download via Bandcamp on the same day as the game , as was a separate album featuring variously arranged versions of the game &amp; apos ; s tracks . &amp; quot ; Shovel Knight &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; graphics , similar to its music , mimics the style of older video game titles from the NES era and even limited itself to the NES color palette ( although the game does include four extra colors not present in the NES color palette ) and animation count .
This meant that larger sprites were superimposed on a black background to keep the limit of colors available on a screen to a realistic maximum .
Other trickery to properly honor the NES limitations include camera shakes that only act on a single axis and a game interface that acts as a background layer instead of being overlaid on top of the gameplay .
In other aspects , &amp; quot ; Shovel Knight &amp; quot ; permits itself to ignore some limitations of NES era consoles . The game was originally slated for release in September 2013 , but was delayed into early 2014 .
After various further delays , Yacht Club Games announced on June 5 that the game would be released on June 26 , 2014 .
The game was eventually released on several additional platforms including both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ; both versions feature exclusive boss battles , with Kratos from &amp; quot ; God of War &amp; quot ; in the former and the &amp; quot ; Battletoads &amp; quot ; in the latter .
A physical release for various platforms occurred in October 2015 . Prior to 2017 , the game was sold under the name &amp; quot ; Shovel Knight &amp; quot ; , with various additional campaigns appearing as free downloadable content .
However , an update in April 2017 made the original story campaign and additional downloadable campaigns available for standalone purchase on certain platforms , with the original campaign adorning the subtitle &amp; quot ; Shovel of Hope &amp; quot ; .
A compilation containing all three campaigns known as &amp; quot ; Shovel Knight : Treasure Trove &amp; quot ; was also available , with all owners who purchased the original game prior to this update having their game updated to the &amp; quot ; Treasure Trove &amp; quot ; edition .
&amp; quot ; Shovel Knight &amp; quot ; received positive reception by critics , according to review aggregator Metacritic .
IGN editor Colin Moriarty awarded the game a 9 / 10 rating , calling it &amp; quot ; arguably the best game released so far in 2014 . &amp; quot ; Infendo . com called it &amp; quot ; a brilliant homage to a bygone era , yet an equally fresh , captivating and innovative game &amp; quot ; and Nintendo Life praised the 3DS version &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; excellent controls , gorgeous graphics , an incredible soundtrack and endearing characters . . .
top-notch level design , varied gameplay , hidden rooms , optional challenges and a deceptively rich combat system . &amp; quot ; Ben &amp; quot ; Yahtzee &amp; quot ; Croshaw of Zero Punctuation reviewed the game favorably , especially praising the storytelling through gameplay and the difficulty which reminded him of the way &amp; quot ; Dark Souls &amp; quot ; utilized these elements .
He noticed that while some people might &amp; quot ; write &amp; # 91 ; the game &amp; # 93 ; off as &amp; apos ; nostalgia bait &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; , he has &amp; quot ; never owned an NES , so if &amp; # 91 ; he &amp; # 93 ; liked &amp; quot ; Shovel Knight &amp; quot ; , it can &amp; apos ; t possibly be working on nostalgia alone &amp; quot ; . Including Kickstarter backers , &amp; quot ; Shovel Knight &amp; quot ; sold 180,000 copies within a month of the North American launch .
49,000 copies were sold on Wii U , 59,000 were sold on 3DS , and 66,000 were sold on Steam .

Two months later , having been elected to sit on the opposition benches ( albeit officially as an independent ) , he joined the ranks of the Socialist-led majority in the National Assembly .
He explained frankly that being a member of the majority would make it easier for him to lobby the government for funds and services for his constituents - who , he said , cared little for the left-right divide prevalent in metropolitan France .
He subsequently sat as an independent on the benches of the left .
Specifically , he promised to lobby for the setting up of a better sewerage system in the territory , and faster repairs following damage caused by a cyclone .
His crossing the floor so soon after his election caused strong reactions within the UMP , with party leader Jean-François Copé describing it as &amp; quot ; shocking &amp; quot ; and the party &amp; apos ; s parliamentary leader Christian Jacob calling it &amp; quot ; outrageous &amp; quot ; . His re-election in June 2017 was annulled by the Constitutional Council on 2 February 2018 , forcing a by-election .

He first appears in the 4660th episode , originally broadcast in the United Kingdom on 20 June 2013 .
Carl is the ex-boyfriend of Kirsty Branning ( Kierston Wareing ) , and his storylines include tracking down cash owed to him by Derek Branning ( Jamie Foreman ) , which Ian Beale ( Adam Woodyatt ) has used to open a restaurant , trying to win Kirsty back , a relationship with Roxy Mitchell ( Rita Simons ) and feuds with Max Branning ( Jake Wood ) , Phil Mitchell ( Steve McFadden ) and Ronnie Mitchell ( Samantha Womack ) , who kills him .
He is a villainous character , who has been called &amp; quot ; manipulative &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; unpredictable &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; nasty &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; scary &amp; quot ; , though Jim Shelley from the &amp; quot ; Daily Mail &amp; quot ; called him &amp; quot ; a fairly undistinguished presence &amp; quot ; .
The character was axed in September 2013 and departed in the episode first broadcast in the UK on 1 January 2014 , a joint broadcast of episodes 4775 and 4776 , after being killed by Ronnie . Carl arrives at Bianca Butcher &amp; apos ; s ( Patsy Palmer ) house , after she telephones him thinking his number belonged to her father David Wicks ( Michael French ) .
Bianca assumes Carl is the plumber , but when the real plumber arrives , Carl says he is the friend of Derek Branning ( Jamie Foreman ) that Bianca called .
He learns that Derek is dead , and claims to know his daughter Alice Branning ( Jasmyn Banks ) , so Bianca gives him her address .
He visits Alice , who gives him the box that contained the phone number , which Alice says was found by Ian Beale ( Adam Woodyatt ) .
Bianca &amp; apos ; s friend Kat Moon ( Jessie Wallace ) realises that Carl lied about knowing Alice and warns Alice and Bianca to be wary of him .
Carl visits Ian , who denies knowing Derek .
Carl realises Ian took £ 10,000 from the box that Derek owed him , and Ian is terrified of Carl .
The next day , Carl sees his ex-girlfriend , Kirsty Branning ( Kierston Wareing ) , who says she is now married and pregnant , and he has no reason to stay .
At the restaurant , Carl makes Ian confess to taking his money , and tells Ian to pay him £ 500 a week for the foreseeable future .
He then tells Kirsty he is not leaving .
Ian soon realises the situation between Carl and Kirsty , so he threatens to tell Kirsty about Carl &amp; apos ; s blackmail .
Carl responds by burning Ian &amp; apos ; s hand . Joey Branning ( David Witts ) catches Carl dealing drugs in the nightclub , R &amp; amp ; R and informs Phil Mitchell ( Steve McFadden ) and Kirsty &amp; apos ; s husband Max Branning ( Jake Wood ) , who confront and threaten Carl .
Max calls the police because he thinks Carl is involved in Kirsty nearly getting mugged by Carl &amp; apos ; s brother Adam White ( Ben Wigzell ) and Carl is checked for drugs by the police in front of Kirsty .
Carl has none , and later tells Max that in three weeks &amp; apos ; time , he will end Max and Kirsty &amp; apos ; s relationship .
Three weeks later , Carl deliberately cuts the brakes on his car , then takes Phil as his passenger , and crashes it after releasing Phil &amp; apos ; s seatbelt .
Phil is hospitalised and Carl frames Max for cutting the brakes after forcing Ian to become a false witness , promising to cancel the debt .
Max is arrested and released on bail , until Carl goads him into attacking him , and he is remanded in custody .
Max ends his relationship with Kirsty under Carl &amp; apos ; s instructions , who has threatened to harm his daughter Lauren Branning ( Jacqueline Jossa ) . Carl attempts to take over Phil &amp; apos ; s businesses while he is in hospital , and after Shirley Carter ( Linda Henry ) challenges him , she mysteriously disappears .
Carl attempts to reconcile with Kirsty but she rejects him .
However , she later approaches him and they have sex , but he sees her stealing £ 1000 from him the next morning .
On the day of Max &amp; apos ; s trial , Ian fails to turn up , and Max is released without charge , to Carl &amp; apos ; s fury .
Max and Phil then kidnap Carl and Phil offers Max the chance to kill him .
Max declines and leaves , so Phil prepares to kill him instead until Carl implies that he caused harm to Shirley and knows where she is .
He leads Phil to a block of run-down flats where Shirley is staying with her sister , Tina Carter ( Luisa Bradshaw-White ) .
It is revealed that Carl threatened Shirley to stay away from Walford or he would harm Phil &amp; apos ; s family .
Carl leaves , but Phil confronts him later .
Carl declares that he has contacts inside prison who can harm his son if Phil does anything to him .
Carl then tells Max that he had sex with Kirsty while he was in prison , leading to Max ending his relationship with Kirsty . When Roxy Mitchell ( Rita Simons ) splits from her husband Alfie Moon ( Shane Richie ) immediately after their wedding , Carl flirts with a drunken Roxy .
She insists she is not interested , but later waits outside his new flat and they have sex when he returns .
They start a relationship , which Roxy &amp; apos ; s sister Ronnie Mitchell ( Samantha Womack ) disapproves of and tries to split them up .
She confronts Carl , who is violent towards her and a final threat leads to her hitting him over the head with a champagne bottle ; he falls unconscious .
She ties him up in Phil &amp; apos ; s garage and the next day tells him to leave Walford and never return , but he ignores her and attempts to rape her , kissing her forcefully .
She slams the boot of a car onto his head , killing him , and has the car crushed with his body inside . Coonan &amp; apos ; s casting as Carl was announced on 6 May 2013 , when it was revealed that the character is Kirsty Branning &amp; apos ; s ( Kierston Wareing ) ex-boyfriend and has been in prison , where he had shared a cell with Derek Branning ( Jamie Foreman ) .
Coonan said of his casting , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; has been a part of my life since I was 12 years old .
I even remember talking about the storylines in school playgrounds in Tottenham and I am very happy and proud to now be a small part of its life . &amp; quot ; Executive producer Lorraine Newman said : &amp; quot ; It &amp; apos ; s wonderful to have Daniel Coonan joining us in Walford to play Carl White .
Oozing confidence and with a dangerous edge , will Kirsty be able to resist his bad boy charms for long , or can &amp; # 91 ; Kirsty &amp; apos ; s husband &amp; # 93 ; Max &amp; # 91 ; Brannning &amp; # 93 ; save her from the lure of the dark side ? &amp; quot ; This is Coonan &amp; apos ; s second role in &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; , as he played David Priors in 2011 .
Coonan said the four-episode role helped him prepare for a bigger role in the programme , though describing his first day on set as Carl , he said , &amp; quot ; it still hits you when you walk on to the Square for the very first time .
It &amp; apos ; s like walking into your TV . &amp; quot ; Coonan filmed his first scene on the Bridge Street market set .
&amp; quot ; Heat &amp; quot ; reported that Carl &amp; apos ; s introduction was part of a &amp; quot ; rescue plan &amp; quot ; to increase ratings for &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; , especially with the announced departures of popular characters Tanya Branning ( Jo Joyner ) , Jack Branning ( Scott Maslen ) and Michael Moon ( Steve John Shepherd ) , saying &amp; quot ; with ever-dwindling ratings and an unusually bare trophy cabinet , producers have been forced to plan some major shake-ups in an attempt to revive the ailing drama with new characters , returning familiar faces and exciting storylines . &amp; quot ; Coonan later said of being cast , &amp; quot ; When they offered the part of Carl to me , I thought about it as long as it takes to blink your eyelids .
I knew it would be a great character and fun to play .
Something like this can massively raise your profile .
I &amp; apos ; m beaming into thousands of people &amp; apos ; s homes four times a week . &amp; quot ; Coonan was originally contracted to appear in 28 episodes over a six-month period , but instead filmed over 60 episodes .
After Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in the show , he revealed that he was approached to play Carl . Carl is characterised as an unemployed man who has spent five and a half years in prison for drug offences .
His backstory on the &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; website states that he grew up on a tough south London estate with his brothers .
Upon his announcement , he was described as confident , dangerous and charming , while many news reports referred to him as a &amp; quot ; bad boy &amp; quot ; character .
Coonan called the character a dark horse , very clever , manipulative and &amp; quot ; slippery &amp; quot ; , and said that Carl is &amp; quot ; exciting to play &amp; quot ; because he is unpredictable , adding that you should always expect the unexpected with Carl .
He compared the character to other villains from the series , saying he is &amp; quot ; right up there with them . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Inside Soap &amp; quot ; called Carl &amp; quot ; nasty &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; evil &amp; quot ; , and said that he fills the &amp; quot ; super-villain &amp; quot ; role last taken by Derek , hoping that he would &amp; quot ; shake the Square to its foundations . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Heat &amp; quot ; said of Carl , &amp; quot ; there &amp; apos ; s a new baddie in town and he &amp; apos ; s proper scary . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Soaplife &amp; quot ; reported that Carl would be the show &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; toughest bad guy yet &amp; quot ; .
Digital Spy called him &amp; quot ; cunning and ruthless &amp; quot ; , and Jim Shelley from the &amp; quot ; Daily Mail &amp; quot ; called him &amp; quot ; a violent drug-dealing criminal &amp; quot ; . Coonan hoped that Carl would be as devious as original villain Den Watts ( Leslie Grantham ) , hoping for &amp; quot ; spicy storylines &amp; quot ; for his character , who is &amp; quot ; a bad guy &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; pretty nasty &amp; quot ; with &amp; quot ; a dark way of going about things . &amp; quot ; However , he hoped that Carl would have redeeming qualities and that he would not be &amp; quot ; a total arch-villain &amp; quot ; .
He also compared Carl to William Shakespeare &amp; apos ; s Iago ( from &amp; quot ; Othello &amp; quot ; ) , and said Carl is a film fan who would compare himself to Al Pacino in films such as &amp; quot ; Scarface &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; The Godfather &amp; quot ; .
He also said Carl presents &amp; quot ; different fronts to different people &amp; quot ; and opined that there is &amp; quot ; a bit of nice in him &amp; quot ; , but he likes to dominate , make money and have influence , and would not be good until he achieves that .
He wondered if Carl would be capable of settling down and starting a family .
On playing a villain , Coonan said , &amp; quot ; It is good fun playing the bad guys .
They are the always the best to play .
They do not care how people perceive them .
They do not have the normal social restrictions . &amp; quot ; He said that Carl is &amp; quot ; slightly psychotic &amp; quot ; and is &amp; quot ; the sort of person who finds it genuinely heartwarming to see people suffer &amp; quot ; .
In October 2013 , Coonan said that Carl had been &amp; quot ; an absolute bastard &amp; quot ; during his six months in the show . Carl &amp; apos ; s profile on the official &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; website says he is &amp; quot ; seductive &amp; quot ; and can draw people to him , especially women , and can easily fool people .
He can read people quickly , understanding what they want , and can tell who has power , but is waiting for a moment when he can take it for himself because he enjoys having power .
He rarely gets into fights , is unsympathetic and angry , becoming suspicious of everybody .
He is entrepreneurial , pragmatic and ingenious , and could have been a successful businessman if he did not choose a life of crime , though it was the only way he knew to get women , cars and money .
He will do whatever he can to get what he wants .
In August 2013 , Coonan said , &amp; quot ; I wouldn &amp; apos ; t mess with a man like Carl — I would stay indoors a lot more if I &amp; apos ; d got on the wrong of someone like him .
He &amp; apos ; s someone who doesn &amp; apos ; t care and who &amp; apos ; ll go to any lengths to take people out . &amp; quot ; In the run-up to Carl &amp; apos ; s departure , &amp; quot ; All About Soap &amp; quot ; called him &amp; quot ; a horrible bloke &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; Heat &amp; quot ; said Carl &amp; quot ; thinks he &amp; apos ; s hard as nails , but compared to &amp; # 91 ; Ronnie , who attacks him &amp; # 93 ; , he &amp; apos ; s just a big old pussycat . &amp; quot ; Carl is brought to Walford by Bianca Butcher ( Patsy Palmer ) after she finds his telephone number in her uncle Derek &amp; apos ; s belongings .
Derek had stolen Carl &amp; apos ; s money and Carl wants it back , though it has been found by Ian Beale ( Adam Woodyatt ) following Derek &amp; apos ; s death , and he has spent it .
Coonan said , &amp; quot ; the only way Carl knows how to get that cash back is to threaten people . &amp; quot ; He said that getting the money back is his first mission in Walford .
Digital Spy said that Carl &amp; quot ; leaves Ian Beale fearing for his life &amp; quot ; . Carl is Kirsty &amp; apos ; s ex-boyfriend , and Coonan explained that they were in a relationship before he went to prison .
Carl was in his early 20s and Kirsty was 16 when they met and he became obsessive of her .
Their relationship was based on hedonism and excess , rather than tenderness .
When he went to prison , Kirsty promised to wait for him to be released , but she realised their relationship was toxic and ceased all contact .
She then went on to marry Max .
Carl is still in love with Kirsty , believing her to be &amp; quot ; the only woman for him &amp; quot ; and his second mission in Walford is to get her back .
Coonan said this would cause problems between Carl and Max .
He later said that &amp; quot ; In Carl &amp; apos ; s head , he &amp; apos ; s coming in on a white horse to save Kirsty from a bad marriage &amp; quot ; , and explained that while Carl was in prison he focussed on Kirsty , and she &amp; quot ; become an object of this freedom he was dreaming about .
&amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; Now he sees she &amp; apos ; s poodling after Max and that he isn &amp; apos ; t treating her right . &amp; quot ; However , he thought that Kirsty may not want to reunite with Carl because &amp; quot ; he &amp; apos ; s not the type of guy who &amp; apos ; s just going to change overnight &amp; quot ; and he is probably not &amp; quot ; the knight in shining armour &amp; quot ; he thinks he is .
Coonan went on to say that Carl would treat Kirsty &amp; quot ; like a goddess &amp; quot ; but would probably have a problem with her independence , and he would want to provide for her , being &amp; quot ; old-fashioned and a bit misguided &amp; quot ; , and they would have a &amp; quot ; fiery &amp; quot ; relationship because they are both &amp; quot ; strong-willed &amp; quot ; .
Kierston Wareing , who plays Kirsty , opined that her character is more suited to Carl than to Max , and hoped they could be a &amp; quot ; manipulative , power couple &amp; quot ; . In July 2013 , Carl &amp; apos ; s mother Nora White is introduced for a single episode , played by Lynn Farleigh , when he and Kirsty visit her in a nursing home .
&amp; quot ; Inside Soap &amp; quot ; said that Nora is &amp; quot ; pure , unbridled evil &amp; quot ; and her introduction might show why Carl is a menace , giving viewers a &amp; quot ; glimpse into &amp; # 91 ; his &amp; # 93 ; twisted upbringing &amp; quot ; .
They said there is tension between Carl and Nora , and compared her digging her fingernails into his hand to his burning of Ian &amp; apos ; s hand , asking &amp; quot ; has Carl learnt everything he knows from his evil mum ? &amp; quot ; Jim Shelley thought that Nora &amp; apos ; s introduction &amp; quot ; seemed to be the start of a campaign trying to garner some sympathy for Carl — henceforth , a nasty , charmless bully &amp; quot ; .
Coonan said that Nora is &amp; quot ; dominating and horrible &amp; quot ; and shows that Carl has &amp; quot ; demons within his own family &amp; quot ; and a &amp; quot ; troubled background &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; Inside Soap &amp; quot ; hoped that Carl would &amp; quot ; give notorious bad boy Phil Mitchell a run for his money &amp; quot ; , and Coonan said that he had filmed scenes with Steve McFadden , who plays Phil , saying that &amp; quot ; You can only have so many alpha males in one place before it kicks off ! &amp; quot ; On 11 July 2013 , it was reported that Carl and Phil would be involved in a &amp; quot ; massive car accident which leaves both men unconscious &amp; quot ; , caused by Carl .
The storyline involves a flipped car and a helicopter , from which a birds-eye view of the crash scene is seen .
It is reported to have cost £ 1 million to make , said to be the most expensive stunt &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; has ever filmed .
The crash was filmed over two days and was directed by Michael Owen Morris , who had to create what was originally scripted as &amp; quot ; car hits wall &amp; quot ; and compared it to a James Bond film .
Newman said the crash was &amp; quot ; A suitably explosive start to a jam-packed autumn and winter full of love , romance and reprisals &amp; quot ; , while a show insider said , &amp; quot ; The crash is going to change things for many residents in Albert Square .
There will be serious repercussions and with the twists and turns we have planned for the aftermath , everything might not be as it seems . &amp; quot ; It was also hoped that the storyline would be &amp; quot ; the most talked about TV moment of the year &amp; quot ; . Coonan spoke to David Brown from &amp; quot ; Radio Times &amp; quot ; about the crash , where it was said that Carl would &amp; quot ; show just how evil he can be &amp; quot ; by causing it .
Coonan said that Carl causes the crash because he wants to depose Phil as &amp; quot ; top boy &amp; quot ; in Albert Square , saying it is &amp; quot ; such an insane thing to do .
You get to see how nuts Carl is .
He doesn &amp; apos ; t care if Phil dies yet he risks damaging himself as well .
&amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; He realises he will have to get rid of him . &amp; quot ; He also said that Phil is a &amp; quot ; major barrier &amp; quot ; for Carl getting what he wants , so he could either go into business with Phil or eliminate him .
On filming the crash , Coonan explained that he was inside the car when the glass was detonated , and he suffered cuts on his leg and hand .
Brown said the crash looks &amp; quot ; visceral and intense &amp; quot ; on screen , and said that Phil is not scared of Carl because he sees him as a &amp; quot ; wannabe &amp; quot ; and a &amp; quot ; young pretender &amp; quot ; , but added that &amp; quot ; there is obviously more to &amp; # 91 ; Carl &amp; # 93 ; than &amp; # 91 ; Phil &amp; # 93 ; realises . &amp; quot ; On 3 September 2013 , it was reported in the &amp; quot ; Daily Star &amp; quot ; that Carl would be buried in a shallow grave by Phil and Max .
The &amp; quot ; Daily Mail &amp; quot ; reported that this was an act of revenge because of the car crash and &amp; quot ; Carl has become the bane of Max Branning &amp; apos ; s life &amp; quot ; .
Danny Walker from the &amp; quot ; Daily Mirror &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; if you try and kill a Mitchell and blame Max Branning for cutting the brakes , it will have repercussions . &amp; quot ; Coonan revealed that in the run-up to his departure , Carl becomes a &amp; quot ; bit of a lone wolf &amp; quot ; after giving up trying to win Kirsty back , and said he has no friends because he has threatened everyone .
Coonan shares scenes with actresses Samantha Womack , who plays Ronnie Mitchell , and Rita Simons , who plays Roxy Mitchell , but the actor explained that both characters realise that Carl is &amp; quot ; a bit too dark to get involved with &amp; quot ; and he is &amp; quot ; probably going a bit mad because he can &amp; apos ; t get Kirsty back &amp; quot ; .
It was reported on 1 December 2013 that Roxy would &amp; quot ; seek solace &amp; quot ; in Carl after her marriage is annulled , but Shane Richie , who plays Roxy &amp; apos ; s ex-husband Alfie Moon , said Roxy is doing it because she has &amp; quot ; her freedom back — and she &amp; apos ; ll be throwing it in Alfie &amp; apos ; s face &amp; quot ; , despite being warned off Carl by Ronnie and Phil .
&amp; quot ; Soaplife &amp; quot ; said that Roxy is &amp; quot ; hooked on the excitement of being with Carl . &amp; quot ; Ronnie and Carl then start a feud , and it was reported that it would &amp; quot ; come to a head with some dark twists &amp; quot ; , and that &amp; quot ; One last showdown then sees Ronnie get rid of Carl forever . &amp; quot ; On 24 September 2013 , it was announced that Carl , along with three other characters — Kirsty Branning ( Kierston Wareing ) , Poppy Meadow ( Rachel Bright ) and AJ Ahmed ( Phaldut Sharma ) — had been axed from the series by the new executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins .
It was reported that Treadwell-Collins was &amp; quot ; determined to get &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; back to its best &amp; quot ; and a spokesperson confirmed the departures .
Reports said that it was hoped the move would increase ratings , and a show source added that &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; Treadwell-Collins &amp; # 93 ; didn &amp; apos ; t feel the characters who are leaving fit with the direction he is taking the show so he quickly decided to write them out .
He has only been in a month but he is already making big changes .
He knows what he wants for &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; and is putting plans in place quickly . &amp; quot ; Coonan filmed his final scenes before Christmas 2013 and departed in 2014 . Coonan hoped the character would &amp; quot ; go out in a blaze of glory &amp; quot ; , saying &amp; quot ; That would be a kind of logical end for him .
Either marry him off or blow him up ! &amp; quot ; He felt that the producers no longer wanted bad characters in &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; , saying &amp; quot ; they want &amp; # 91 ; it &amp; # 93 ; to be about love and deceit . &amp; quot ; He had hoped that other sides to the character could have been explored , such as Carl winning Kirsty back and then trying to stay out of trouble but failing , or turning them into a criminal couple while showing Carl &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; more human side &amp; quot ; . Carl &amp; apos ; s first episode , broadcast on 20 June at 7 : 30pm on BBC One , received overnight ratings of 6 . 64 million , an audience share of 33 . 7 % , while the BBC Three repeat , shown at 1am on 21 June , was watched by 210,000 people , 8 . 3 % of the total viewing audience at that time .
Jim Shelley from the &amp; quot ; Daily Mail &amp; quot ; reviewed Carl &amp; apos ; s first two episodes , and called him &amp; quot ; a fairly undistinguished presence in jeans and a grey hoodie . &amp; quot ; Shelley sarcastically wrote that &amp; quot ; He was also ( you &amp; apos ; ll never guess ) a menacing villain .
&amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; hasn &amp; apos ; t had a new one of those for , ooh , weeks . &amp; quot ; On making his way around Albert Square to discover Ian stole his cash , Shelley wrote , &amp; quot ; Perhaps surprisingly , Carl was also such expert psychologist he should have been a master criminal rather than the petty criminal he really is , or working in Harley Street .
Within 24 hours , this led him directly to his money and allowed him to negotiate an extortion rate from Ian of £ 500 a week plus all the free portions of Jean &amp; apos ; s Sausage Surprise he can eat .
&amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; It was pretty impressive for two episodes .
&amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; It turned out Carl was Bad News .
What other kind is there in &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; ? &amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; Carl worked his magic on Ian , assessing his character and weakness , and manipulating him to get what he wanted with the skill of &amp; quot ; The Mentalist &amp; quot ; . &amp; quot ; He went on to comment on Kirsty &amp; apos ; s line , &amp; quot ; He &amp; apos ; s someone you don &amp; apos ; t want in your life &amp; quot ; , saying , &amp; quot ; Or in your TV show . &amp; quot ; Gary Gillatt from &amp; quot ; Inside Soap &amp; quot ; wrote of Carl &amp; apos ; s arrival , &amp; quot ; Walford &amp; apos ; s new super-villain shows big promise .
We loved how Kat boldly shoved up her boobs the moment she saw Carl , but then had him pegged as a wrong &amp; apos ; un in seconds .
And &amp; # 91 ; Ian is &amp; # 93 ; scared — and so are we ! &amp; quot ; David Brown from the &amp; quot ; Radio Times &amp; quot ; said the character is &amp; quot ; shaping up nicely &amp; quot ; as the latest bad-boy character .
He later stated that Carl could help increase ratings if viewers feared him , saying , &amp; quot ; We &amp; apos ; re making some headway here with bad boy Carl , whose Robert De Niro routine is unsettling the locals .
But , let &amp; apos ; s face it , his mother was ten times more intimidating and she was only in one episode .
EastEnd life should always be a combination of charm and menace : for every Jack Branning , there should be a Trevor Morgan .
Get Carl and his old ma to join forces — then we &amp; apos ; d be getting somewhere . &amp; quot ; Ally Ross from &amp; quot ; The Sun &amp; quot ; was critical of the character , saying : Filipa Jodelka from &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; Carl is an &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; speciality , a new character shoehorned in with a backstory that &amp; apos ; s not so much shadowy as completely obscured .
Everyone seems to be scared of him , though , because apparently wandering around the Square silently pulling faces counts as menacing these days . &amp; quot ; Victoria Garo-Falides from the &amp; quot ; Daily Mirror &amp; quot ; said Carl is &amp; quot ; on track to be the shortest , scariest man ever to walk the Square &amp; quot ; . Coonan received a nomination for &amp; quot ; best bad boy &amp; quot ; at the 2013 Inside Soap Awards , on which he said &amp; quot ; I was massively surprised to be nominated &amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; because the story involving Carl and Max was only just starting to kick in . &amp; quot ; Coonan was not shortlisted for the award .
He said that he was being recognised in public and that &amp; quot ; everybody seems to really love the character &amp; quot ; . When it was announced that Coonan would be leaving the show in 2014 , Yahoo ! TV UK said , &amp; quot ; It &amp; apos ; s been enjoyable for a while — but there &amp; apos ; s only so many hardmen that the Square can handle . &amp; quot ; Vicky Prior from the &amp; quot ; Metro &amp; quot ; said , &amp; quot ; I shall be glad to see the back of &amp; # 91 ; Carl &amp; # 93 ; . &amp; quot ; After Carl was killed off , Brown from &amp; quot ; Radio Times &amp; quot ; said Carl &amp; quot ; won &amp; apos ; t be missed &amp; quot ; because &amp; quot ; His poor-man &amp; apos ; s Robert De Niro shtick was starting to grate and &amp; quot ; EastEnders &amp; quot ; has never really thrived when it &amp; apos ; s put pre-watershed gangsters centre stage . &amp; quot ;

SüleymanpaşaSüleymanpaşa is a planned district and second level municipality in Tekirdağ Province , Turkey .
According to the 2012 Metropolitan Municipalities Law ( law no .
6360 ) , all Turkish provinces with a population more than 750 000 , will be a metropolitan municipality and the districts within the metropolitan municipalities will be second level municipalities .
The law also creates new districts within the provinces in addition to present districts .
These changes will be effective by the local elections in 2014 . Thus , after 2014 , the present Tekirdağ central district will be named Süleymanpaşa , and the name Tekirdağ will be reserved for the metropolitan municipality .
The name Süleymanpaşa refers to the Ottoman prince Süleyman , the first commander of Turkish troops in Thrace in the 14th century . There were four towns and 55 villages in the rural area of Süleymanpaşa district .
Now their official status became &amp; quot ; neighborhood of Süleymanpaşa &amp; quot ; .

Mantonico biancoMantonico bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety grown in the Calabria wine region of southern Italy .
The grape should not be confused with the similarly named Calabrian grape Montonico bianco or with Guardavalle , which is known as Mantonico in the province of Cosenza in Calabria .
In the early 21st century , DNA profiling suggested that Mantonico bianco may be one of the parent varieties of the red Calabrian grape Gaglioppo which is also known as Mantonico nero . Today Mantonico bianco is used to make both dry varietal and sweet &amp; quot ; passito-style &amp; quot ; dessert wines under several Calabrian &amp; quot ; Indicazione geografica tipica &amp; quot ; ( IGT ) designations .
The grape is also potentially one of the permitted varieties in the &amp; quot ; Denominazione di origine controllata &amp; quot ; ( DOC ) wines of Bivongi and Donnici , however , the regulations for those DOCs do not differentiate between Mantonico bianco and Montonico bianco with the later most often being used in those wines . A Mantonico vine growing in Calabria was documented in the 1601 work of the Italian writer Girolamo Marafioti , who grew up in the commune of Polistena in Calabria , then part of the Kingdom of Naples .
Ampelographers believe that this is the earliest mention of Mantonico bianco and that the grape is probably a native of the district of Locri in Reggio Calabria . Over the years , Mantonico bianco has often been confused with other similarly named Calabrian grapes , including Montonico bianco and Guardavalle , which shares the synonym of &amp; quot ; Mantonico &amp; quot ; in the Cozenza province .
It was also once thought that the grape was potentially a white-berried color mutation of one of the several varieties that are known as Mantonico nero , including Gaglioppo .
While DNA analysis has shown that Mantonico bianco is not a color mutation , it has suggested a close relationship between the grape and Gaglioppo , with Mantonico bianco being potentially one of the parent varieties of the red Calabrian grape .
Further DNA evidence suggests that Mantonico bianco may also be a parent variety of the Marchione grape of Apulia and the Sicilian grape Nerello Mascalese . Even in the very warm climate of southern Italy , Mantonico bianco is late ripening and often one of the last varieties to be harvested in a growing season .
The grape has strong resistance to many viticultural hazards including downy and powdery mildew . Mantonico bianco is grown almost exclusively in Calabria with most plantings found along Calabria &amp; apos ; s coastline on Ionian Sea , particularly around the seaside communes of Bianco and Casignana .
Here the grape is used in the production of IGT wines in both dry and passito-style wines either as a varietal or part of a blend . Mantonico bianco can potentially be used in the DOC wines of Bivongi in the Vallata dello Stilaro of Reggio Calabria and Donnici on the La Sila plateau in the province of Cosenza but the DOC regulations do not differentiate Mantonico bianco from Montonico bianco with most producers using only the later variety in those wines . According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson , Mantonico bianco has the potential to produce dry and sweet wines with a wide range of aroma profiles from floral to herbal to mineral with some examples having &amp; quot ; exotic fruit &amp; quot ; notes . Over the years , Mantonico bianco has been known under a variety of synonyms including : Mantonacu , Mantonica vera , Mantonico Maclugnese , Mantonico vero , Mantonicu Pizzutella , Mantonicu vera and Mantonacu Viru della Locride .

From 1860 until 1880 , he was assistant to the secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture .
For several years , he was president of the Massachusetts Fish and Game Protective Association ( 1885-1892 ) , besides following the business of a publisher of musical works ( 1870-c . 1890 ) .
He developed a process for engraving by photography directly from nature or from a photographic print . Samuels contributed long essays to U .

StenomytiStenomyti is an extinct genus of small aetosaur .
It contains a single species , Stenomyti huangae , which is known from a skull , postcranial skeleton and other referred material from the Late Triassic Chinle Formation , Eagle Basin of Colorado , United States .
&amp; quot ; Stenomyti &amp; quot ; is distinguished from other aetosaurs by eight autapomorphies ( unique traits ) , however its osteoderms are nearly identical to those of &amp; quot ; Aetosaurus &amp; quot ; which suggests that osteoderms are not always reliable taxonomic indicators for aetosaurs .
Based on its osteoderms , and other shared cranial characters with &amp; quot ; Aetosaurus &amp; quot ; , it was suggested that these taxa are closely related and lie outside the clade containing Typothoracisinae and Desmatosuchinae .

Calvary Cemetery ( St .
Louis ) Calvary Cemetery is a Roman Catholic cemetery located in St .
Louis , Missouri and operated by the Archdiocese of St .
Louis .
Founded in 1854 , it is the second oldest cemetery in the Archdiocese .
Calvary Cemetery contains 470 acres ( 1 . 9 km ² ) of land and more than 300,000 graves , including those of General William Tecumseh Sherman , Dred Scott , Tennessee Williams , Kate Chopin , and Auguste Chouteau . In 1849 a cholera epidemic struck St .
Louis and claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people .
This disaster prompted city officials to pass an ordinance banning the creation of new cemeteries within city limits , as it was thought that such a measure could prevent additional people from becoming sick .
At the same time , existing cemeteries in St .
Louis were nearly full and had no room to expand .
Recognizing the need for a new rural Catholic cemetery , Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick purchased Senator Henry Clay ’ s “ Old Orchard Farm ” in 1853 , located several miles northwest of St .
Louis .
Kenrick initially set aside the eastern half of the 323-acre farm for a new cemetery , and kept the western half for himself , where he lived for many years in the former Clay Mansion .
Thus Calvary Cemetery opened for burials in 1854 , with Archbishop Kenrick as its first president . Prior to the establishment of Calvary Cemetery , parts of the Clay farm had served as a burial place for Native Americans and soldiers from nearby Fort Bellefontaine .
After 1854 , these remains were reinterred in a mass grave under a large crucifix at one of the highest points in the cemetery .
Graves at other Catholic cemeteries across St .
Louis , such as Old Cathedral , Rock Springs , Holy Trinity , Old St .
Patrick &amp; apos ; s , New Bremen and others were also dug up and reinterred at Calvary .
As the number of graves steadily grew , the cemetery acquired more land , eventually reaching its present-day size of 470 acres , with over 300,000 casketed graves as well as two public mausoleums and columbaria , as well as a number of private family mausoleums and sarcophagi .
Accessible space for full-casket traditional burials is available for the next 300 years at Calvary Cemetery , according to Archdiocesan sources .
Many former St .
Louisans choose to return to Calvary for burial , including August Chouteau X , a great-great-great grandson of the city &amp; apos ; s founder , who lived most of his life in Los Angeles , CA , as well as noted writer and dramatist Tennessee Williams , who was returned here for burial from New York City . In 2003 , a Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Grant funded the construction of a monument at Calvary Cemetery to honor four Nez Perce men who traveled to St .
Louis in 1831 from their home in the Pacific Northwest .
When they arrived in St .
Louis these men had to rely on hand gestures to communicate , and thus nobody was able to ascertain fully the purpose of their journey .
Two of the men , Black Eagle and Speaking Eagle , died of illness while in St .
Louis and are buried in Calvary Cemetery .

Kongo ivoriesKongo ivories are some of the finest sculptural works produced by the people of the west-central Africa &amp; apos ; s Lower Congo region .
In the Kongo Kingdom , ivory was a precious commodity that was strictly controlled by chiefs and kings , who commissioned sculptors to produce fine ivory sculptures for their personal and courtly use .
With the rise of the transatlantic trade , ivory became one of the most valuable African natural resources sought by Western industry .
Eventually , Kongo ivory carvers produced works not only for indigenous leaders and elites but also for Europeans and other foreigners . Most of the earliest extant ivory carvings from sub-Saharan Africa were not made for African consumers .
Richly decorated oliphants , or side-blown horns , from the sixteenth century are among the earliest known of the Kongo Kingdom &amp; apos ; s royal commissions in ivory .
Although made in the form of musical instruments to be used during court ceremonies , many such sculptures were likely given as gifts and made for sale to Portuguese elites , missionaries , and traders .
In the 1950s , historian William Fagg coined the term “ Afro-Portuguese ivories ” to describe Kongo oliphants and other ivory sculptures from this period .
A significant number of Afro-Portuguese ivories are in the British Museum , many of them made in Sierra Leone and Benin in the 15th and 16th centuries . About the middle of the nineteenth century , a new style of ivory carving developed in the area to meet the demand of the export trade along the Loango Coast of west-central Africa .
This style consisted of fine , detailed relief carving that depicts scenes of Kongo life .
Scenes commonly portrayed in relief on the ivories capture the dynamic and cosmopolitan coastal activity related to the transatlantic trade . Most carved Loango tusks are not longer than two to three feet because they were sourced from forest elephants , which are much smaller than the African savannah elephant .
Full Loango tusk sculptures that were sculpted from the enormous tusks of savannah elephants are extremely rare ; one notable example is now part of the Brooklyn Museum ’ s collection .

Tailor WibbelTailor Wibbel ( German : Schneider Wibbel ) a 1938 opera by the German composer Mark Lothar .

Hopeless ( Roy Lichtenstein ) Hopeless is a 1963 painting with oil paint and acrylic paint on canvas by Roy Lichtenstein .
The painting is in the collection of the Kunstmuseum Basel . &amp; quot ; Hopeless &amp; quot ; is derived from Tony Abruzzo &amp; apos ; s panel from &amp; quot ; Run For Love ! &amp; quot ; in &amp; quot ; Secret Hearts &amp; quot ; , no .
83 ( November 1962 ) , DC Comics . During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips .
Lichtenstein in 1958 made drawings of comic strip characters .
Andy Warhol produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960 .
Lichtenstein , unaware of Warhol &amp; apos ; s work , produced &amp; quot ; Look Mickey &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Popeye &amp; quot ; in 1961 .
In the early 1960s , Lichtenstein produced several &amp; quot ; fantasy drama &amp; quot ; paintings of women in love affairs with domineering men causing women to be miserable , such as &amp; quot ; Drowning Girl &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Hopeless &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; In the Car &amp; quot ; .
These works served as prelude to 1964 paintings of innocent &amp; quot ; girls next door &amp; quot ; in a variety of tenuous emotional states .
&amp; quot ; In &amp; quot ; Hopeless &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Drowning Girl &amp; quot ; ( which come from the same source ) , for example , the heroines appear as victims of unhappy love affairs , with one displaying helplessness . . .
and the other defiance ( she would rather drown than ask for her lover &amp; apos ; s help ) . &amp; quot ; Several of Lichtenstein &amp; apos ; s most popular works are his mid-1960s comic images of girls with speech balloons , including &amp; quot ; Drowning Girl &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Hopeless &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Oh , Jeff . . . I Love You , Too . . . But . . . &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; In the Car &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; We Rose Up Slowly &amp; quot ; that have unheroic subjects who appeal to the male ego .
Lichtenstein parodied four Picasso &amp; apos ; s between 1962 and 1963 .
Picasso &amp; apos ; s depictions of weeping women may have influenced Lichtenstein to produce portrayals of vulnerable teary-eyed women , such as the subjects of &amp; quot ; Hopeless &amp; quot ; ( 1963 ) and &amp; quot ; Drowning Girl &amp; quot ; ( 1963 ) .
Another possible influence on his emphasis on depicting distressed women in the early to mid-1960s was that his first marriage was dissolving at the time .
Lichtenstein &amp; apos ; s first marriage to Isabel Wilson , which resulted in two sons , lasted from 1949 to 1965 . &amp; quot ; Hopeless &amp; quot ; is a typical example of Lichtenstein &amp; apos ; s Romance comics with its teary-eyed face and dejected woman filling the majority of the canvas .
Lichtenstein made modifications to the original source using vibrant colors and bold and wavy lines to intensify the emotion of the scene .
The work is considered a significant advancement in Lichtenstein &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; form , color , composition , and overall power of image . &amp; quot ; In works like &amp; quot ; Hopeless &amp; quot ; , Lichtenstein derived enduring art from a fleeting form of entertainment , while remaining fairly true to the source .
This particular source is considered typical melodramatic romance comic scene for that era .

Gladhand connectorA gladhand connector or gladhand coupler is an interlocking hose coupling fitted to hoses supplying pressurized air from a tractor unit to air brakes on a semi-trailer , or from a locomotive to railway air brakes on railroad cars .
Gladhand connectors resemble a pair of &amp; quot ; hands shaking &amp; quot ; when interlocked , hence the name . Gladhands are designed to allow the driver to disconnect without a mechanic or tools .
They sometimes utilize a quick release style to speed up brake release time .
A tractor / trailer typically has two gladhands - one for service brakes and another for emergency brakes .
Gladhands are color coded .
In North America , service lines are blue and emergency brake lines are red and are standardized by SAE International &amp; apos ; s standard SAE J318 .
Outside North America , the supply lines are red and the control lines are yellow , following International Organization for Standardization &amp; apos ; s standard ISO 1728 .
The SAE &amp; quot ; service &amp; quot ; lines are synonymous with the ISO &amp; quot ; supply &amp; quot ; lines and the &amp; quot ; emergency &amp; quot ; lines are synonymous with ISO &amp; quot ; control &amp; quot ; linesMated rubber grommets provide a positive seal .
Joined halves separate automatically when depressurized .
Gladhand couplers are typically genderless or hermaphroditic , allowing them to be freely connected to each other , for example allowing either end of a railcar to be connected to the end of a train .
North America has a system of standardized gladhand sizes .
Reuben T .
DurrettDurrett was born 22 January 1824 in Henry County , Kentucky .
Durrett &amp; apos ; s primary schooling as a boy was in Henry County .
After graduating from high school , from 1844 until 1846 , he attended Georgetown College some 50 miles away in Georgetown , Kentucky .
Durrett then attended Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island .
He earned a Bachelor &amp; apos ; s degree in 1849 . Durrett went then to the University of Louisville and took up courses in law .
He earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in one year ( 1850 ) , which was normally a two-year course of study .
Durrett received an honorary Master &amp; apos ; s degree in 1853 from Brown University .
In time he received from the three colleges he attended the Doctor of law honorary degree . Durrett then practiced law in Louisville for almost thirty years after receiving his law degree .
During his law career he served one term on the Louisville City Council and in 1852 campaigned for Winfield Scott for president .
On July 21 , 1857 , Durrett was in a pistol duel with George D .
Prentice over statements made between their two rival newspapers .
In 1861 he spent a short time in prison for his views on secession .
During the time he was a lawyer he obtained a half interest in &amp; quot ; Louisville Courier &amp; quot ; newspaper and was its editor until 1859 . Durrett was an avid collector of historical material , especially pertaining to Kentucky .
He had an extensive library .
In 1871 several citizens of Louisville were considering creating a local library .
Some citizens thought a circulating library with an annual fee was a route to go .
Durrett did a study on why libraries that charged for the use of books failed eventually .
He had the viewpoint that books should be made available free to use by anyone .
He drew up a library charter and created &amp; quot ; The Public Library of Kentucky &amp; quot ; .
He was the library &amp; apos ; s first president .
Eventually this became the Louisville Free Public Library and it inherited Durrett &amp; apos ; s historical collection of rare books and historical material as its core collection . Durrett wrote poetry in the 1850s and retired as a Louisville lawyer in 1880 .
His retirement hobby was that of writing and collecting historical material .
In his historical activities he gathered friends and went on &amp; quot ; historic excursions &amp; quot ; .
These excursions consisted of trips throughout the Kentucky countryside using old authentic maps , some made by John Filson .
It is believed that the notion for a local historical society was sparked when the 27th Governor of Ohio Charles Anderson accompanied him and his friends on one of these excursions .
On May 15 , 1884 , it was established that every first Monday of each month his friends would get together at Durrett &amp; apos ; s home library ( Brook and Chestnut Streets ) .
It eventually became the Filson Historical Society ( a . k . a .
The Filson Club ) .
Its main purpose was the preserving of Kentucky history by collecting rare unpublished material .
Durrett , being the main organizer , became its first president .
Durrett &amp; apos ; s home became the meeting place of the Club from 1884 to 1913 .
Many historians , including Theodore Roosevelt ( &amp; quot ; Winning of the West &amp; quot ; ) , used The Filson Club and Durrett &amp; apos ; s library . Durrett is from French ancestors that can be traced back to a well known French physician named Louis Duret that lived in the sixteenth century .
The American family line in the United States of all Durretts can trace their genealogy back to three brothers ( John , Richard , and Bartholomew Durrett ) , descendants of Louis Duret that immigrated from England to Spotsylvania County , Virginia in the eighteenth century . Durrett was a son of William and Elizabeth Rawlings Durrett .
His father , a wealthy farmer , built the first brick house in Henry County about 1813 some 2 miles north of New Castle and is where Durrett was born and raised .
Francis Durrett , the father to William Durrett and grandfather to the subject of this article , served under George Rogers Clark during the Illinois campaign .
After the campaign Francis went back to his home in Henry County , which was then part of Virginia .
This is where William Durrett , father to the subject of this article , was born and raised . Durrett married Elizabeth Humphreys Bates from Cincinnati , Ohio on December 16 , 1852 .
They had four children .
Durrett had one son that lived to adulthood , William T .
Durrett , a medical doctor .
His other children all died before he did . The Durretts are of French origin , the surname having been originally spelt &amp; quot ; Duret &amp; quot ; in France .
Because of the St .
Bartholomew &amp; apos ; s Day massacre , some Durets that followed the Protestant faith , left France and went to England .
In England the French name &amp; quot ; Duret &amp; quot ; was pronounced like the English name &amp; quot ; Duray &amp; quot ; to get the French sound of the name .
In time then , to differentiate one name from the other another &amp; quot ; r &amp; quot ; and another &amp; quot ; t &amp; quot ; were added to the French name Duret making the English version of the French surname spelled then as &amp; quot ; Durrett &amp; quot ; . Durrett died in Louisville on September 16 , 1913 .
He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery of the same city . Durett &amp; apos ; s manuscript collection was acquired by the University of Chicago Library in 1913 .
Also included was an important and large collection of rare books and periodicals .
The collection is organized and divided into a dozen groups from &amp; quot ; Pictures , Maps , and Sketches &amp; quot ; to historical manuscripts and personal papers .

Hermitage of BraidThe Hermitage of Braid is an area between the Braid Hills and Blackford Hill .
The Braid Burn runs through it .
It comprises part of the Hermitage of Braid and Blackford Hill Local Nature Reserve . The Braid estate was the property of the de Brad family one of whom , Henri de Brad , was Sheriff of Edinburgh in the 12th century .
A castle stood on the estate until the 18th century .
In the 18th century the estate was purchased by the lawyer Charles Gordon of Cluny ( died 1814 ) , who commissioned the present house , known as Hermitage of Braid or Hermitage House , which stands on the north side of the Braid Burn .
The house was built in 1785 and the architect was Robert Burn : the castellated Gothic style may have been influenced by the work of Robert Adam .
Charles Gordon &amp; apos ; s son was the soldier and MP Colonel John Gordon ( c . 1776 – 1858 ) .
The house is a category A listed building . In 1937 the then owner of the Hermitage , John McDougal , gifted the land to the city for use as a public park .
A pillar in the grounds records the gift , and the subsequent opening of the park on 10 June 1938 by Lord Provost Sir Louis Gumley .
The house is now a visitor centre for the nature reserve , and offices of the City of Edinburgh Council &amp; apos ; s Countryside Natural Heritage Service .
Bolivian general election , 1888General elections were held in Bolivia in 1888 .
Aniceto Arce of the Conservative Party was elected President with 80 % of the vote . In the 1884 elections , no presidential candidate won an absolute majority of the public vote , resulting in the President being elected by Congress .
Gregorio Pacheco of the Democratic Party was elected after the Conservatives decided to support Pacheco .
Their decision followed an agreement between Mariano Baptista of the Conservative Party and Jorge Oblitas and Casimiro Corral of the Liberal Party that Pacheco would work to support Conservative candidate Aniceto Arce in the next elections in 1888 .

The Edge of the UnknownThe Edge of the Unknown : 101 Things You Don &amp; apos ; t Know about Science and No One Else Does Either is a popular science book written by American physicist James Trefil .
Published in 1996 , the 355-page work is Trefil &amp; apos ; s 10th publication . According to a review on the &amp; quot ; Publishers Weekly &amp; quot ; website , &amp; quot ; if readers overlook the fatuous subtitle ; ( the book provides ) a competent and sometimes fascinating tour of the frontiers of scientific inquiry , such that the readers will appreciate being able to satisfy their curiosity about the likelihood of time travel , the causes of cancer and the future of computers with this user-friendly resource . . . ( readers ) will come away sharing the author &amp; apos ; s respect and awe for achievements of those who scan the geometric surfaces of viruses and construct molecular remedies for deadly diseases , probe chaotic system of the earth &amp; apos ; s atmosphere and even try to save us from our genetically encoded craving for fat . &amp; quot ; According to Bruce Slutsky , &amp; quot ; the book &amp; apos ; s major shortcoming is that treatment of each issue is very cursory ( only three-page summations ) with no historical context or extended discussion on the philosophical consequences of scientific discoveries .
Trefil also makes his readers feel disappointed by failing to provide bibliographies of references that consider these issues in more detail of questionable value to public libraries . &amp; quot ;

International Society for Forensic GeneticsThe International Society for Forensic Genetics - ISFG is an international non-profit scientific society founded in 1968 .
The main goal of the society is to advance the field of forensic genetics , also termed DNA profiling , through dissemination of scientific results and opinions , communication amongst scientists and education .
The bi-annual international ISFG congresses , international workshops and seminars , the society ’ s highly acclaimed scientific journal ( http : / / www . fsigenetics . com Forensic Science International : Genetics ) , and the scientific recommendations on current topics all work towards this goal .
The society ’ s website http : / / www . isfg . org contains up to date information on all activities . The International Society for Forensic Genetics - ISFG – was founded in 1968 in Mainz , Germany , under the name ‘ Gesellschaft für forensische Blutgruppenkunde ’ ( Society for Forensic Haemogenetics ) .
The society was founded as a non-profit organisation according to German civil law .
The original aim of the society was to promote the science of genetic markers in human blood for use in forensic science .
In 1989 , the society was transformed to an international society ( ‘ International Society for Forensic Haemogenetics - ISFH ’ ) .
In 1991 , based on the transition from traditional serological markers in blood to universal DNA polymorphisms the name was changed into ‘ International Society for Forensic Genetics ’ .
Currently the ISFG strives to support all research interests in forensic genetics , also including non-human DNA studies , RNA based test systems , and large scale sequencing technologies . In May 2015 , the ISFG had approx .
1,200 individual members from more than 50 countries .
The members are typically in academic institutions , criminal justice and police organizations , as well as private companies .
The members ’ fields of expertise include forensic biology , molecular genetics , population genetics , blood group serology , forensic pathology , parentage testing , biostatistics , criminal law , medical ethics , and more . The ISFG organises biennial international congresses , with educational workshops preceding the congress .
This is achieved with the help of local forensic institutes or universities that will form a local organizing committee and host the congress under the joint leadership of the ISFG board and the local congress president .
From1985-2005 , conference volumes with short articles based on these presentations were originally published as books under the title ‘ Advances in Forensic Haemogenetics ’ and later as ‘ Progress in Forensic Genetics ’ .
All volumes after 2001 can be accessed openly on-line . Since 2007 , the proceedings have been published electronically as part of the ‘ Forensic Science International : Genetics Supplement Series ’ and can be accessed freely either through a link on the ISFG website or directly through http : / / www . fsigeneticssup . com .
Past ISFG meetings have been held mainly in Europe but also in cities on other continents such as New Orleans and San Francisco in the US , Buenos Aires in Argentina , and Melbourne , Australia .
The ISFG meetings often serve as a focal point for a dialogue of relevant scientific issues , as in the 2007 Single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) panel discussion , or the debate on the limits of low template DNA in forensic genetics . The DNA Commission of the ISFG functions as an international DNA expert advisory group and is formed based on emerging needs when dealing with new DNA technologies .
For each topic the ISFG board will invite scientists with specific expertise and form a commission to discuss open issues and formulate recommendations that provide guidance to forensic geneticists .
While not binding , these recommendations are a first step to establishing standards for new genetic typing methods .
Topics have included best practices for paternity and relationship testing .
ISFG recommendations are a valuable tool for forensic geneticists and as such are highly cited by other scientists . Shortly after the implementation of polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) based short tandem repeat ( STR ) DNA testing the ISFG was instrumental in the standardization of allele designations , which was a key component in inter-laboratory data comparability and the creation of national DNA databases .
DNA commission topics also have included best practices for paternity and relationship testing now integrated into forensic genetics textbooks .
All published recommendations of the DNA and the Paternity Testing Commissions can be accessed openly on the ISFG website . The ISFG has language-based working groups for Chinese , English , French , German , Italian , Korean and Spanish-Portuguese members .
They meet regularly and typically work on topics of regional or national interest .
The English Speaking Working Group ( ESWG ) offers an annual exercise for paternity testing laboratories .
The Relationship Testing Workshop is open to all members of the ESWG and each year , blood samples , a questionnaire and a paper challenge are sent to the participating laboratories ( http : / / www . rtw-eswg . forensic . ku . dk ) . The Spanish and Portuguese Speaking Working Group of the ISFG ( GHEP-ISFG ) ) was founded in 1989 and has been actively supporting and coordinating the development of forensic DNA typing in Spain , Portugal and Latin America .
The GHEP focuses on quality and scientific methodology and has organised many collaborative exercises on a variety of topics and shared the results with the scientific community through several publications ( https : / / ghep-isfg . org / en / ) .
GHEP has also established a proficiency testing program , which as of December 2014 has been accredited by ENAC under the standard ISO / IEC 17043 : 2010 . The European DNA Profiling Group - EDNAP - was established in 1988 by scientists from European countries .
The initial purpose of EDNAP was to harmonize DNA technologies for criminal investigations so that DNA results could be exchanged across the borders in Europe .
In 1991 , the group was included among the working groups of the ISFG .
It consists of approximately 20 European laboratories .
and collaborates closely with the DNA Working Group of the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes – ENFSI ( http : / / www . enfsi . eu / ) . EDNAP organises collaborative exercises in order to explore the possibility of standardization of new forensic genetic methods .
The results of the exercises are published in peer-reviewed journals .
One valuable resource resulting from these activities is the &amp; quot ; EDNAP mitochondrial DNA Population Database &amp; quot ; , short EMPOP , which is being maintained by the Institute for Legal Medicine of the Innsbruck Medical University , Austria .
This database allows for the determination of the statistical weight of evidence for forensic mitochondrial DNA typing results ( http : / / empop . org ) . The general assembly of ISFG members has appointed a number of distinguished honorary members , among them Erik Essen-Möller , Alsbäck / Lysekil , Sweden ; Ruth Sanger , London , UK ; Otto Prokop , Berlin , Germany ; Konrad Hummel , Freiburg , Germany ; Sir Alec Jeffreys , Leicester , UK .

Rolling bed dryerRolling bed dryers are used for efficiently processing large amounts of material that need their respective moisture levels reduced .
Rolling bed dryers are most often used for drying wood chips and organic residues and are most often utilized in the biomass , waste / recycling , wood particle board , pellet , and biofuel industries . The versatility of the rolling bed dryer is based on its simple idea of product circulation .
The biomass processed through the rolling bed dryer can be not only efficiently dried but also has the option of being cleaned simultaneously .
This provides for efficiency and conservation in energy which results in lower production costs .
Biomass is being increasingly used as an alternative fuel source .
Providing for this demands innovative solutions . Large bulks of biomass is permanently circulated and mixed by highly effective paddles .
This basic idea combines the flow of large bulks of product good heat transfer with continuous movement of the product for even drying results .
The drying air is supplied through a perforated plate under the moving bulk of product .
Depending on the amount of ventilation . , it is possible to separate fine materials such as dust , fibers , and sand from the bulk material collecting this separately alongside the ongoing drying process . This simultaneous cleaning occurs through the use of the material against itself to remove , separate , and collect fine materials such as fibers , sand and dust from the drying bulk material .
Having this occur at the same time as the drying process saves not only time and energy , but also maintains better the caloric value of the residual biomass and reduces ash content . After the drying process is completed the dried output is suitable for direct firing and pelletizing / briquetting as well as for more demanding processes such as gasification or torrefaction of biomass .

By age 18 she was an accomplished rider , and has continued to ride for pleasure into her Diamond Jubilee year . In her role as monarch , Elizabeth has also ridden in a ceremonial role .
From her first appearance as princess in 1947 and throughout her reign as queen until 1986 , she attended the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony on horseback .
Initially , she rode a bay police horse named Tommy in 1947 .
When her father , George VI , was unwell , she rode in his place on his chestnut horse Winston , and she rode Winston after George VI &amp; apos ; s death .
Later she rode a chestnut horse named Imperial .
For eighteen consecutive years , from 1969 to 1986 , her horse was a black mare named Burmese .
Burmese was a gift from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
From 1987 onward , since Burmese retired , she has attended in a carriage . Elizabeth owns many thoroughbred horses for use in racing , having initially inherited the breeding and racing stock of her late father King George VI , in 1952 .
Up until the late 1960s she raced her own-bred stock as well as horses bred by the National Stud .
Her registered racing colours ( termed silks ) , as worn by the jockeys riding her race horses , are the same as those used by her father and great-grandfather , King Edward VII ; a purple and scarlet jacket with gold braiding , with black cap .

VPN blockingVPN blocking is a technique used to block the encrypted protocol tunneling communications methods used by virtual private network ( VPN ) systems .
Often used by large organizations such as national governments or corporations , it can act as a tool for computer security or Internet censorship by preventing the use of VPNs to bypass network firewall systems . Blocking VPN access can be done a few different ways .
Ports that are used by common VPN tunneling protocols , such as PPTP or L2TP , to establish their connections and transfer data can be closed by system administrators to prevent their use on certain networks .
Similarly , a website can prohibit access to its content by blocking access from IP addresses that are known to belong to popular VPN providers .
Some governments have been known to block all access to overseas IP addresses , since VPN use often entails connecting to remote hosts that do not operate under that government &amp; apos ; s jurisdiction . As organizations have ramped up efforts to block VPN access bypassing their firewalls , VPN providers have responded by utilizing more sophisticated techniques to make their connections less conspicuous , creating a networking arms race .
For instance , as the Chinese government began using deep packet inspection to identify VPN protocols , Golden Frog began scrambling OpenVPN packet metadata for its popular VyprVPN service in an attempt to avoid detection . Chinese internet users started reporting unstable connections in May 2011 while using VPNs to connect to overseas websites and services such as the Apple App Store .
Universities and businesses began issuing notices to stop using tools to circumvent the firewall . In late 2012 , companies providing VPN services claimed the Great Firewall of China became able to &amp; quot ; learn , discover and block &amp; quot ; the encrypted communications methods used by a number of different VPN systems . Deng Jiewei , a 26-year-old from Dongguan in Guangdong province , has been sentenced to nine months in jail for selling VPN via his own website in March 2017 . In 2017 , telecommunications carriers in China were instructed by the government to block individuals &amp; apos ; use of VPNs by February 2018 . The government of Iran began blocking access to non-government sanctioned VPNs in March 2013 , a few months prior to the 2013 elections , to &amp; quot ; prosecute users who are violating state laws &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; take offenders to national courts under supervision of judiciary service &amp; quot ; .
Use of VPNs approved by the government reportedly led to surveillance and inspection of private data . In July 2017 , the State Duma passed a bill requiring the Internet providers to block websites that offer VPNs , in order to prevent the spreading of &amp; quot ; extremist materials &amp; quot ; on the Internet . .
It &amp; apos ; s unclear how exactly how Russia plans to implement their new regulation ; though it seems like both the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) and ISPs will be tasked with identifying and cracking down on VPNs . Russian internet users have also reported a block on the ExpressVPN VPN service .
In November , 2017 BBC made it clear that Russia has not banned VPN usage entirely .
VPN usage is only banned when attempting to access sites already blocked by Roskomnadzor or Russia &amp; apos ; s governing body for telecommunications and mass media communications .
Using a VPN for business or personal reasons to access legal sites in Russia is permitted . The government of Syria activated Deep Packet inspection after the uprising in 2011 in order to block VPN connections .
The censorship targeted different VPN protocols like OpenVPN , L2TP and PPTP . The government of Egypt activated Deep Packet inspection after the Egyptian Revolution in 2011 in order to block VPN connections and to block access to Objection Media and newspaper sites .
The censorship targeted different VPN protocols like OpenVPN , L2TP and PPTP and some sites . In an attempt to stop unauthorized access from users outside the US , Hulu began blocking users accessing the site from IP addresses linked to VPN services in April 2014 .
In doing so , however , the company also restricted access from legitimate U . S . -based users using VPNs for security reasons .
VPN providers such as VikingVPN , NordVPN , Purevpn and TorGuard stated that they would seek ways to address this issue for their customers by speaking directly to Hulu about a resolution and rolling out more dedicated IP addresses , respectively . Netflix came under pressure from major film studios in September 2014 to block VPN access , as up to 200,000 Australian subscribers were using Netflix despite it not being available yet in Australia .
VPN access for Netflix has , like other streaming services , allowed users to view content more securely or while out of the country .
Netflix users have also used VPNs as a means of bypassing throttling efforts made by service providers such as Verizon .
It is also important to note that all VPNs might slow internet connection when trying to stream Netflix ; however , there are cases where using a VPN might improve your connection if your ISP has been throttling Netflix traffic . As of June , 2018 the Netflix VPN and proxy ban is still active .
The CEO of Netflix , Reed Hastings made a comment in 2016 about the VPN market as a whole ; “ It ’ s a very small but quite vocal minority .
It ’ s really inconsequential to us . ”

Muscat bleuMuscat bleu is a red Swiss wine and table grape variety that is a hybrid of Garnier 15-6 and Perle noire .
The grape was developed in Peissy in the Canton of Geneva by Swiss grape breeder Charles Garnier in the 1930s .
Today the grape is used as both a table grape and for winemaking , producing wines that Master of Wine Jancis Robinson describe as &amp; quot ; soft and grapey &amp; quot ; .
Outside Switzerland some plantings of Muscat bleu can also be found in Belgium . Muscat bleu is considered to be a &amp; quot ; complex hybrid &amp; quot ; , meaning that within its lineage are grape varieties belonging to several different species of the grapevine genus , &amp; quot ; Vitis &amp; quot ; .
Despite having the name &amp; quot ; Muscat &amp; quot ; , there are actually no Muscat grape varieties closely related to Muscat bleu .
The grape is result of a crossing of Garnier 15-6 and Perle noire , both varieties themselves being inter-specific crossings with complex lineages . Garnier 15-6 is a crossing of Villard noir , developed in Southwest France by Bertille Seyve and Victor Villard , and the &amp; quot ; Vitis vinifera &amp; quot ; grape Müller-Thurgau developed by Swiss grape breeder Hermann Müller .
Villard noir is a crossing of the Seibel grapes Chancellor and Les Subéreux which have &amp; quot ; Vitis labrusca &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Vitis riparia &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Vitis rupestris &amp; quot ; in their lineages .
Müller-Thurgau is a crossing of two &amp; quot ; vinifera &amp; quot ; varieties , Riesling and Madeleine Royale . Perle noire is a crossing of the &amp; quot ; Vitis vinifera &amp; quot ; Spanish table grape variety Teneron and Seyve-Villard 12-358 which , itself , is a complex hybrid from the Seibel grapes Les Subéreux and Seibel 6468 . Muscat bleu is an early ripening variety that buds midway through the budding period of the growing season .
The vine produces large , loose clusters of large size berries that give off a sweet &amp; quot ; grapey &amp; quot ; , muscat-like aroma that can attract wasps to the vineyard .
Muscat bleu has good resistance to fungal infections such as downy mildew but is susceptible to the viticultural hazards of coulure and millerandage . Today Muscat bleu is found in Switzerland and Belgium where it is used for both table grape and wine production .
In Switzerland , the grape is a popular planting among home gardeners but as of 2009 there were at least of Muscat bleu dedicated to commercial wine production . As a relatively recently created hybrid , Muscat bleu does not have many synonyms with only Aromato , Garnier 83 / 2 , Muscat bleu Garnier and Muskat bleu generally recognized .

Javier BáezEdnel Javier Báez ( born December 1 , 1992 ) is a Puerto Rican professional baseball infielder for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Born in Puerto Rico , Báez attended high school in Jacksonville , Florida .
The Cubs selected Báez with the ninth overall selection of the 2011 MLB Draft .
He made his MLB debut on August 5 , 2014 . He is the first player for the Cubs to steal home in a postseason game since Jimmy Slagle in 1907 .
In October 2016 , Báez was named the National League Championship Series co-MVP alongside left-handed starter Jon Lester as the Chicago Cubs clinched their 2016 National League pennant . Born and raised in Puerto Rico , Báez moved to Florida in 2005 along with his mother and siblings , two brothers and a sister .
The move was so that his sister , Noely , could get medical treatment for her spina bifida condition .
In Puerto Rico he and his two brothers , Gadiel and Rolando , became familiar with the sport through their father , Ángel Luis Báez who , before his death when Javier was ten , heavily influenced their life and was responsible for their interest in baseball .
The brothers would later immortalize this interest by getting tattoos of Major League Baseball &amp; apos ; s logo , which symbolized that &amp; quot ; baseball has been in &amp; # 91 ; their &amp; # 93 ; lives forever . &amp; quot ; As a middle school student , it took time for Báez to adapt because he was unable to fluently speak or understand English .
Báez eventually learned the language through trial and error in a process that lasted for three years , memorizing words before knowing their actual meaning .
Báez attended Arlington Country Day School ( ACD ) in Jacksonville , Florida .
His coach at ACD , Ron Dickerson , noted that initially scouts were not impressed by him , noting his talent , but not believing he could become a star .
Dickerson emphasized that Báez &amp; apos ; s work ethic was responsible for positioning him as a real prospect .
As a sophomore , he had a . 463 batting average with 38 hits , of which nine were doubles and 13 were home runs .
Making 82 plate appearances in 25 games , he also gathered 60 runs batted in ( RBIs ) .
By the time that his junior season was over , Báez was a highly rated Aflac All-American .
In his senior season , he recorded 64 hits in 83 at-bats to gather an average of . 771 , which included 20 doubles and 22 home runs .
In total , Báez recorded 52 RBIs in 30 games .
During his time at ACD , he never played a position steadily .
After working at second base , Báez was moved to shortstop once the team lost a player .

He committed to play college baseball at Jacksonville University . The Chicago Cubs , led by Jim Hendry , selected Báez in the first round , with the ninth overall selection , of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft .
He began his professional career by playing shortstop for the Arizona Cubs of the Rookie-level Arizona League , where he only played in three games , recording three hits , including two doubles , in 12 at-bats and two stolen bases .
Promoted to the Boise Hawks of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League , Báez recorded one single in six at bats across two games .
On September 29 , 2011 , he was selected third overall by the Leones de Ponce in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente &amp; apos ; s ( LBPRC ) rookie draft , but did not play due to the Cubs &amp; apos ; limitations . Before the 2012 season , MLB . com rated Báez as the 62nd best prospect in baseball .
He remained with the Cubs in extended spring training with other prospects , participating in 26 games and hitting 6 doubles , 3 triples , and 8 home runs , with 28 RBI , 11 stolen bases , and 23 strikeouts in 94 plate appearances .
He made his regular season debut with the Peoria Chiefs of the Class A Midwest League .
He was promoted to the Daytona Cubs of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League ( FSL ) .
&amp; quot ; Baseball America &amp; quot ; included Báez in two of its &amp; quot ; Best Tools &amp; quot ; lists , naming him the &amp; quot ; Most Exciting Player in the Midwest League &amp; quot ; and the &amp; quot ; Best Defensive Infielder &amp; quot ; in the Chicago Cubs system .

With a more patient approach at the plate , Báez began a hitting streak on May 16 , 2014 .
On May 26 , 2014 , Báez was named the PCL Player of the Week for the previous week . On May 22 , 2014 , the Cangrejeros de Santurce of the LBPRC signed Báez by exploiting a legal loophole that allowed players to be considered free agents unless properly signed within three years of being drafted .
However , the Leones de Ponce quickly reclaimed his local player rights , claiming that they had approached him with the intent of formalizing a contract but that the &amp; quot ; extreme fatigue &amp; quot ; clause of the Winter League Agreement had interfered . On August 5 , the Cubs promoted Báez to the major leagues .
In his debut that day , he hit his first career home run ; the game-winner in the 12th inning victory against the Colorado Rockies , becoming the first player since Miguel Cabrera in 2003 to hit an extra innings home run in his debut .

Prentice Co-operative Creamery CompanyThe Prentice Co-operative Creamery Company in Prentice , Wisconsin was central to the community &amp; apos ; s transition from lumber to agriculture .
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 . Prentice was founded on the lumber industry when the local sawmill opened in 1882 .
But the sawmill closed in the 1890s when the best timber ran out .
Without that big industry , people wondered how little communities left in the cut-over would survive . The United States Leather Company had run a tannery in Prentice starting in the late 1800s , using hemlock bark from the surrounding forests in its tanning process .
It was the only industry in town after the sawmill closed .
When the tannery burned in February 1906 , U . S .
Leather rebuilt it , with the core of the current creamery building as its hide house .
But then the tannery burned again after only a couple weeks of operation .
The brick hide house survived the fire . Meanwhile , more and more farmers had been settling the surrounding cut-over lands left by logging .
Around 1903 the private Prentice Creamery started buying milk and selling butter .
In 1915 , a farmers &amp; apos ; co-operative called the Prentice Co-operative Creamery Company was formed , and it converted the old hide house to a dairy plant .
It produced 500 pounds of butter in its first day of operation ; by July 1917 it produced over 9000 pounds in six days .
The local paper gushed : &amp; quot ; Everyone is urged to boost for the farmers creamery because it is a small industry which will help to do wonders to help develop the farming community , the prosperity of which causes the town to improve . &amp; quot ; The co-op closed in 1931 during the Great Depression , but was re-opened by R . J .
Peterson as the Price County Dairy .
In 1933 this was taken over by the Price County Co-operative Dairy Association , which shifted production to cheese .
In its first nine months it produced 100,632 pounds of butter and 153,832 pounds of cheese . The creamery closed in the 1940s , and the building was used by Heikkinen Machine Company , Prentice Wood Products , La Font Corporation , and the Prentek Corporation .
Red Earth ( Dee Dee Bridgewater album ) Red Earth is a 2007 studio album by Dee Dee Bridgewater .
It carries the subtitle &amp; quot ; A Malian Journey &amp; quot ; to celebrate and explore her African and Malian ancestry .
Nominated for Best Jazz Vocal Album at the 2008 Grammy Awards , it reached Number 16 on Billboard &amp; apos ; s Top Jazz Album chart . John L .
Walters of &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; stated &amp; quot ; After a few underwhelming &amp; quot ; crossover &amp; quot ; projects , US singer Dee Dee Bridgewater has made a cracking album that unites great jazz singing with the Malian griot tradition .
Red Earth is neither fusion nor compromise but a happy meeting of African musicianship and Afro-American romanticism .
Mostly recorded in Bamako , it includes several Malian songs : a sparkling version of Kasse Mady Diabaté &amp; apos ; s Bad Spirits ( Bani ) , featuring Toumani Diabaté , and a joyous duet with Ramata Diakité on the latter &amp; apos ; s Mama Don &amp; apos ; t Ever Go Away ( Mama Digna Sara Ye ) .
Bridgewater makes a point of incorporating music and performances by several fine women singers and writers : Oumou Sangare , Mamani Keita , Fatamata &amp; quot ; Mama &amp; quot ; Kouyaté ( on the bluesy title track ) and Tata Kouyaté on Bambo ( No More ) , her famous protest against forced marriage .
An amazing cast of Malian musicians make classics such as Afro Blue and Long Time Ago ( Wayne Shorter &amp; apos ; s Footprints with lyrics ) sound reborn , giving Nina Simone &amp; apos ; s Four Women new depth and power .
Wonderful . &amp; quot ; All compositions by Dee Dee Bridgewater , except as noted . All tracks recorded in Bamako ( Mali ) At Studio Bogolan except tracks 11 , 12 and 13 recorded in Paris at Davout studios .

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 . Constructed during the lumber boom of the 1800s , the dam would open during the spring and logs were transported down the river .
In 1992 , the dam underwent renovation with assistance from multiple sources , including the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest and the historical society of Price County , Wisconsin .
Lévy-Biche LB . 2The Levy Biche LB . 2 was a single seat French biplane fighter aircraft designed to be used from aircraft carriers .
With a watertight fuselage , jettisonable wheeled undercarriage and small under-wing floats , it could survive emergency sea touchdowns ; it could also be fitted with seaplane type floats . The LB . 2 was designed as a shipboard fighter .
It was a single bay sesquiplane , with outward leaning parallel pairs of interplane struts and wire cross bracing .
The wings were strictly rectangular in plan , the lower plane smaller in both span and chord .
The upper wing carried full span ailerons .
Its flat sided fuselage was watertight and its belly deep ; in emergency touchdowns at sea the undercarriage could be jettisoned with the aircraft stabilised with two small rectangular cross section , planing floats mounted on the lower wing underside below the interplane struts . The LB 2 was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 8Fe upright water-cooled V-8 engine .
The upper wing was high above the fuselage on cabane struts and had a rounded cut-out in the trailing edge over the pilot &amp; apos ; s open cockpit to enhance his view .
He had a short , faired headrest .
The fuselage tapered aft and had distinct narrow keel to enhance its water surface behaviour .
The braced tailplane was wide chord and triangular in plan , carrying split elevators ; the fin was also broad and triangular , with a deep , curved rudder that reached down to the bottom of the extreme keel , where there was a very small tailskid .
The jettisonable main fixed conventional undercarriage structure had two short V-struts , supporting a wire cross braced single axle and mainwheels .
Armament consisted of a pair of 7 . 7 mm ( 0 . 303 in ) Vickers machine guns . The first flight was in 1927 and by October that year it had also flown with seaplane style floats .
Soon after , Constructions Aéronautiques J Levy became bankrupt and production rights were purchased by Etablissements P .
Levasseur .
The latter built twenty production aircraft during 1928-9 , designated LB . 2 AMBC . 1 , which served on the experimental French aircraft carrier Béarn , commissioned in May 1927 , as well as from shore bases .
RaydaleRaydale is a dale on the south side of Wensleydale in North Yorkshire , England .
The northern part of the dale is the valley of the River Bain , which flows out of Semerwater , one of very few lakes in the Yorkshire Dales .
Above the lake the dale is drained by smaller becks , and is joined by two smaller dales , Cragdale on the east and Bardale on the west . There are 3 hamlets in the dale , Countersett , Marsett and Stalling Busk .
The village of Bainbridge lies at the mouth of the dale . The dale is a broad , flat-bottomed U-shaped valley , with a significant woodland cover around Semerwater and the other water courses .

Grover C .
HallGrover Cleveland Hall , Sr .
( January 11 , 1888 – 1941 ) was an American newspaper editor .
At the &amp; quot ; Montgomery Advertiser &amp; quot ; in Montgomery , Alabama , he garnered national attention and won a Pulitzer Prize during the 1920s for his editorials that criticized the Ku Klux Klan . Hall was born in Haleburg , Alabama , near the Georgia and Florida borders , and educated in the state &amp; apos ; s country schools .
Grover was ten in 1898 , when his older brother William Theodore Hall started newspaper work in Dothan , Alabama , also in the southeastern corner of the state .
W . T .
Hall was editor of the Dothan &amp; quot ; Eagle &amp; quot ; from 1905 to 1924 ( his death ) and Grover started work under him in 1905 .
There he was a printer &amp; apos ; s devil ; from 1907 to 1910 he worked in editorial positions at the &amp; quot ; Enterprise Ledger &amp; quot ; ( Enterprise , AL ) , &amp; quot ; Dothan Daily Siftings &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Selma Times &amp; quot ; , and at the &amp; quot ; Pensacola Journal &amp; quot ; , where he wrote editorials in 1910 .
That year he moved to be associate editor of the &amp; quot ; Montgomery Advertiser &amp; quot ; in the state capital , where he married in 1912 , became chief editor in 1926 , and was appointed probate judge in 1933 . Today the &amp; quot ; Montgomery Advertiser &amp; quot ; says that it &amp; quot ; waged war on the resurgent Ku Klux Klan &amp; quot ; during the 1920s .
Hall won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing in 1928 for that work .
The official citation specified &amp; quot ; his editorials against gangsterism , floggings and racial and religious intolerance . &amp; quot ; Hall endorsed Al Smith for U . S .
President in 1928 ( against Hoover ) .
He was a friend of H . L .
Mencken , editor of &amp; quot ; The Baltimore Sun &amp; quot ; , and they exchanged many letters , some of which &amp; quot ; inspired Hall to think critically about the South &amp; quot ; .
Mencken did not support democracy but theirs was &amp; quot ; a remarkable coincidence of views &amp; quot ; on less political matters , according to the Hall family biographer ( quoted in the review ) . Late in the 1930s , Hall argued for release of the black Scottsboro Boys who were commonly defended only in the North . On December 4 , 1938 , the &amp; quot ; Advertiser &amp; quot ; published Hall &amp; apos ; s editorial &amp; quot ; The Egregious Gentile Called to Account &amp; quot ; .
It carried the subtitle : &amp; quot ; Clinical notes on his lack of gallantry and sportsmanship , his bad mental habits , his tactlessness , his lack of imagination , his poor discernment , his faults as citizen and neighbor , his gullibility and arrogance . &amp; quot ; Hall observed that &amp; quot ; 1,000,001 articles and books &amp; quot ; have defended the Jew .
&amp; quot ; Fortunately he does not stand in need of defense .
But I can think of 100 reasons why his Gentile brother , usually ignored by critics , invites and deserves arraignment before the bar of his own conscience . . . .
The earth swarms with men who think they are experts on the Jew .
Nobody attempts a critical estimate of the Gentile as a Gentile . . . .
I , for one , marvel at this escape of the Gentile from accountability and justice . &amp; quot ; He concluded that in order to save &amp; quot ; the lovely pillars of civilization we shall have to purge ourselves .
That striding Colossus known as the Nordic Gentile must be born again . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; The Egregious Gentile &amp; quot ; was published in the U . S .
Congressional Record on January 17 , 1939 .
It was issued by the New York City League for Industrial Democracy as pages 27 – 40 of a 40-page pamphlet , with a longer article by the editor of &amp; quot ; The New Republic &amp; quot ; . The pamphlet opened with a two-page dedication to the recently deceased Baruch Charney Vladeck and was sold for 15 cents . Hall married Claudia English in 1912 and they had one son .
His wife suffered an emotional breakdown in 1929 and Hall died of a bleeding ulcer in 1941 ( from a scholarly review of the family biography , &amp; quot ; An Alabama Newspaper Tradition &amp; quot ; ) . Grover Cleveland Hall , Jr .
( February 10 , 1915 – September 24 , 1971 ) was educated in the Montgomery public schools and worked seven years in &amp; quot ; Advertiser &amp; quot ; reporting and writing positions before World War II military service .
In the United States Army Air Corps from 1942 to 1945 , he contributed some articles to the &amp; quot ; Advertiser &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Alabama Journal &amp; quot ; from England .
He was a &amp; quot ; Montgomery Advertiser &amp; quot ; editor after the war , and editor-in-chief from 1956 to 1971 .
Or from 1948 until fired in 1966 .
He also authored the book &amp; quot ; 1000 Destroyed &amp; quot ; about the 4th Fighter Group of the US Army Air Corps .
Hall allied with George C .
Wallace in 1958 and was preparing to be director of publications for the Wallace organization when he died in 1971 . Library of Congress and WorldCat records nominally for the son ( 1915 – 1971 ) actually pertain to both Grover C .
Halls and the family .
Sebastiano VassalliSebastiano Vassalli ( 24 October 1941 – 26 July 2015 ) was an Italian author .
He wrote the 2007 novel &amp; quot ; The Italian ( L &amp; apos ; italiano ) &amp; quot ; . Vassalli was born in Genoa , Italy in 1941 .
His mother are from Tuscany and father were from Lombardy .
At a very young age , he was abandoned to relatives in Novara for some flour and oil .
He went on to complete his Bachelor of arts degree in Milan .
Soon after , Vassalli partnered with Casare Musatti and wrote a book on &amp; quot ; Psychoanalysis and Contemporary Art &amp; quot ; which ultimately began his career as a notable author . Vassalli devoted himself to teaching and researching artistic Neoavanguardia and was also involved with the group 63 .
He was a very dedicated man especially when it came to writing .
He wrote for &amp; quot ; La Repubblica &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; La Stampa &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Corriere della Sera &amp; quot ; . Vassalli &amp; apos ; s works are established based on historical research relating to the evolution of religion , politics , and gender differences .
His novels are normally set in a certain historical context ( Italy in the sixties , the middle ages , and times of counter-fascism ) .
He devotes his works around realistic representations of characters . Vassalli &amp; apos ; s works are known for their ability to represent the extremely simple yet effective nature of the characters of the novels in a sort of fictional manner .
This aspect , together with historical accuracy gives Vassalli ’ s works valuable qualities in terms of teaching them . • &amp; quot ; Italian Literature : Fiction at the Turn of the 21st Century . &amp; quot ; Encyclopædia Britannica Online .

Cambodian genocide denialCambodian genocide denial was the belief expressed by many Western academics that claims of atrocities by the Khmer Rouge government ( 1975-1979 ) in Cambodia were much exaggerated .
Many scholars of Cambodia and intellectuals , opposed to the U . S .
involvement in the Vietnam War , denied or minimized the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge , characterizing contrary information as &amp; quot ; tales told by refugees &amp; quot ; and U . S .
propaganda .
They viewed the assumption of power by the communist Khmer Rouge as a positive development for the people of Cambodia who had been severely impacted by the Vietnam War and the Cambodian Civil War . On the other side of the argument , anti-Communists in the United States and elsewhere saw in the rule of the Khmer Rouge vindication of their belief that the victory of communist governments in South-East Asia would lead to a &amp; quot ; bloodbath &amp; quot ; . Scholar Donald W .
Beachler , writing of the controversy about the range and extent of Khmer Rouge atrocities , concluded that &amp; quot ; much of the posturing by academics , publicists , and politicians seems to have been motivated largely by political purposes &amp; quot ; rather than concern for the Cambodian people . With conclusive evidence ( including the discovery of over 20,000 mass graves ) of a large number of deaths — estimated at between one and three million — of Cambodians caused by the Khmer Rouge , denials , deniers , and apologists largely disappeared , although disagreements concerning the actual number of Khmer Rouge victims have continued .
Against the background of the Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia ( 1978-1979 ) , the United States practiced what the Washington Post called &amp; quot ; hold-your-nose diplomacy &amp; quot ; , recognizing the Khmer Rouge as the legitimate government of Cambodia while abhoring the &amp; quot ; record of genocide &amp; quot ; of the Khmer Rouge .
The U . S .
policy was in solidarity with China , Thailand , and other South East Asian countries who opposed the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia . The Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh , the capital of Cambodia , on April 17 , 1975 and immediately ordered all the residents to evacuate the city .
&amp; quot ; Between two and three million residents of Phnom Penh , Battambang , and other big towns were forced by the communists to walk into the countryside . . .
without organized provision for food , water , shelter , physical security or medical care . &amp; quot ; The evacuation probably resulted in at least 100,000 deaths .
The dispossessed urban dwellers were assigned to re-education camps or &amp; quot ; New Settlements . &amp; quot ; Former government employees and soldiers were executed .
Soon , according to journalists , Cambodia resembled &amp; quot ; a giant prison camp with the urban supporters of the former regime being worked to death on thin gruel and hard labor . &amp; quot ; The Khmer Rouge guarded the border with Thailand and only a few thousand refugees were able to make their way to Thailand and safety .
As virtually no Westerners were allowed to visit Cambodia , those refugees plus the official news outlets of the Khmer Rouge were the principal sources of information about conditions in Cambodia for the next four years . Beachler has described the late 1970s debate about the character of the Khmer Rouge .
&amp; quot ; Many of those who had been opponents of U . S .
military actions in Vietnam and Cambodia feared that the tales of murder and deprivation under the Khmer Rouge regime would validate the claims of those who had supported U . S .
government actions aimed at halting the spread of communism .
Conservatives pointed to the actions of the Khmer Rouge as proof of the inherent evils of communism and evidence that the U . S .
had been right to fight its long war against communists in Southeast Asia . . .
&amp; quot ; Despite the eye-witness accounts by journalists prior to their expulsion during the first few days of Khmer Rouge rule , and the later testimony of refugees ; many academics in the United States , United Kingdom , France , Australia and other countries portrayed the Khmer Rouge favorably or at least were skeptical about the stories of Khmer Rouge atrocities .
None of them , however , were allowed to visit Cambodia under Khmer Rouge rule and few actually talked to the refugees whose stories they believed to be exaggerated or false . Some Western scholars believed that the Khmer Rouge would free Cambodia from colonialism , capitalism , and the ravages of American bombing and invasion during the Vietnam War .
Cambodian scholar Sophal Ear has titled the pro-Khmer Rouge academics as the &amp; quot ; Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia &amp; quot ; ( STAV ) .
The STAV , which he said included among its adherents almost all Cambodian scholars in the Western world , &amp; quot ; hoped for , more than anything , a socialist success story with all the romantic ingredients of peasants , fighting imperialism , and revolution . &amp; quot ; Author William Shawcross was another critic of the STAV academics .
Shawcross &amp; apos ; s views were endorsed and summarized by human rights activist David Hawk : the West was indifferent to the atrocities taking place in Cambodia due to &amp; quot ; the influence of anti-war academics on the American left who obfuscated Khmer Rouge behavior , denigrated the post-1975 refugee reports , and denounced the journalists who got those stories . &amp; quot ; The controversy concerning the Khmer Rouge intensified in February 1977 with the publication of excerpts from a book by John Barron and Anthony Paul in &amp; quot ; Reader &amp; apos ; s Digest &amp; quot ; magazine .
Based on extensive interviews with Cambodian refugees in Thailand , Barron and Paul estimated that , out of a total population of about 7 million people , 1 . 2 million Cambodians had died of starvation , over-work , or execution during less than two years of Khmer Rouge rule .
Published about the same time was François Ponchaud &amp; apos ; s book , &amp; quot ; Cambodia : Year Zero . &amp; quot ; Ponchaud , a French priest , had lived in Cambodia and spoke Khmer .
He also painted a picture of mass deaths caused by the Khmer Rouge .
French scholar , Jean Lacouture , formerly a sympathizer of the Khmer Rouge , reviewed Ponchaud &amp; apos ; s book favorably in &amp; quot ; The New York Review of Books &amp; quot ; on March 31 , 1977 . On May 3 , 1977 , Congressman Stephen Solarz led a hearing on Cambodia in the United States House of Representatives .
The witnesses were Barron and three academics who specialized in Cambodia : David P .
Chandler , who would become perhaps the most prominent American scholar of Cambodia , Peter Poole , and Gareth Porter .
Chandler believed that &amp; quot ; bloodbath &amp; quot ; was an accurate description of the situation and by no means an exaggeration .
Porter stated that the tales of Khmer Rouge atrocities were much exaggerated .
Porter was the most outspoken of the academics .
He had co-authored ( with George Hildebrand ) &amp; quot ; Cambodia : Starvation and Revolution &amp; quot ; , a highly positive book about the Khmer Rouge .
Porter characterized the accounts of a million or more dead Cambodians as wildly exaggerated .
He said , &amp; quot ; I cannot accept the premise . . .
that 1 million people have been murdered systematically or that the Government of Cambodia is systematically slaughtering its people . &amp; quot ; He described the stories by refugees of Khmer Rouge atrocities collected by Barron and others as second-hand and hearsay .
Asked for his sources , Porter cited the works of another adherent of the STAV , Ben Kiernan , an editor for a pro-Khmer Rouge publication in Australia .
Porter never mentioned having spoken to any Cambodian refugees to evaluate their stories personally . Solarz , who had visited Cambodian refugee camps and listened to refugees &amp; apos ; stories of Khmer Rouge atrocities , characterized justifications and explanations during the hearing about the Khmer Rouge as &amp; quot ; cowardly and contemptible &amp; quot ; and compared them to the justifications of the murder of Jews by Adolf Hitler during World War II . Academics Noam Chomsky and Edward S .
Herman were among those who examined the conflicting reports of the situation in Cambodia in 1977 .
On June 6 , 1977 , Chomsky and Herman published an article in &amp; quot ; The Nation &amp; quot ; which contrasted the views expressed in books by Barron and Paul , Ponchaud , and Porter and Hildebrand , and in articles and accounts by Butterfield , Bragg , Kahin , Cazaux , Shanberg , Tolgraven and others .
Their conclusion was : &amp; quot ; We do not pretend to know where the truth lies amidst these sharply conflicting assessments ; rather , we again want to emphasize some crucial points .
What filters through to the American public is a seriously distorted version of the evidence available , emphasizing alleged Khmer Rouge atrocities and downplaying or ignoring the crucial U . S .
role , direct and indirect , in the torment that Cambodia has suffered . &amp; quot ; Chomsky and Herman noted the conflicting information in the various accounts , and suggested that after the &amp; quot ; failure of the American effort to subdue South Vietnam and to crush the mass movements elsewhere in Indochina &amp; quot ; that there was now &amp; quot ; a campaign to reconstruct the history of these years so as to place the role of the United States in a more favorable light &amp; quot ; .
This rewriting of history by the establishment press was served well by &amp; quot ; tales of Communist atrocities , which not only prove the evils of communism but undermine the credibility of those who opposed the war and might interfere with future crusades for freedom . &amp; quot ; They wrote that the refugee stories of Khmer Rouge atrocities should be treated with great &amp; quot ; care and caution &amp; quot ; because &amp; quot ; refugees are frightened and defenseless , at the mercy of alien forces .
They naturally tend to report what they believe their interlocuters wish to hear . &amp; quot ; In support of their assertion , Chomsky and Herman criticized Barron and Paul &amp; apos ; s book &amp; quot ; Murder of a Gentle Land &amp; quot ; for ignoring the U . S .
government &amp; apos ; s role in creating the situation , saying , &amp; quot ; When they speak of &amp; apos ; the murder of a gentle land , &amp; apos ; they are not referring to B-52 attacks on villages or the systematic bombing and murderous ground sweeps by American troops or forces organized and supplied by the United States , in a land that had been largely removed from the conflict prior to the American attack &amp; quot ; .
They give several examples to show that Barron and Paul &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; scholarship collapses under the barest scrutiny , &amp; quot ; and they conclude that , &amp; quot ; It is a fair generalization that the larger the number of deaths attributed to the Khmer Rouge , and the more the U . S .
role is set aside , the larger the audience that will be reached .
The Barron-Paul volume is a third-rate propaganda tract , but its exclusive focus on Communist terror assures it a huge audience . &amp; quot ; Chomsky and Herman had both praise and criticism for Ponchaud &amp; apos ; s book &amp; quot ; Year Zero &amp; quot ; , writing that it was &amp; quot ; serious and worth reading &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; the serious reader will find much to make him somewhat wary . &amp; quot ; In the introduction to the American edition of his book , Ponchaud responded to a personal letter from Chomsky , saying , &amp; quot ; He &amp; # 91 ; Chomsky &amp; # 93 ; wrote me a letter on October 19 , 1977 in which he drew my attention to the way it &amp; # 91 ; &amp; quot ; Year Zero &amp; quot ; &amp; # 93 ; was being misused by anti-revolutionary propagandists .
He has made it my duty to &amp; apos ; stem the flood of lies &amp; apos ; about Cambodia -- particularly , according to him , those propagated by Anthony Paul and John Barron in &amp; quot ; Murder of a Gentle Land . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; A different response appeared in the British introduction to Ponchaud &amp; apos ; s book .
&amp; quot ; Even before this book was translated it was sharply criticized by Mr Noam Chomsky &amp; # 91 ; reference to correspondence with Silvers and the review cited in note 100 &amp; # 93 ; and Mr Gareth Porter &amp; # 91 ; reference to &amp; quot ; May Hearings &amp; quot ; &amp; # 93 ; .
These two &amp; apos ; experts &amp; apos ; on Asia claim that I am mistakenly trying to convince people that Cambodia was drowned in a sea of blood after the departure of the last American diplomats .
They say there have been no massacres , and they lay the blame for the tragedy of the Khmer people on the American bombings .
They accuse me of being insufficiently critical in my approach to the refugee &amp; apos ; s accounts .
For them , refugees are not a valid source . . .
&amp; quot ; After an investigation of this kind , it is surprising to see that &amp; apos ; experts &amp; apos ; who have spoken to few if any refugees should reject their very significant place in any study of modern Cambodia .
These experts would rather base their arguments on reasoning : if something seems impossible to their personal logic , then it doesn &amp; apos ; t exist .
Their only sources for evaluation are deliberately chosen official statements .
Where is that critical approach which they accuse others of not having ? &amp; quot ; Cambodia scholar Bruce Sharp criticized Chomsky and Herman &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Nation &amp; quot ; article , as well as their subsequent work &amp; quot ; After the Cataclysm ( 1979 ) &amp; quot ; , saying that while Chomsky and Herman added disclaimers about knowing the truth of the matter , and about the nature of the regimes in Indochina , they nevertheless expressed a set of views by their comments and their use of various sources .
For instance , Chomsky portrayed Porter and Hildebrand &amp; apos ; s book as &amp; quot ; a carefully documented study of the destructive American impact on Cambodia and the success of the Cambodian revolutionaries in overcoming it , giving a very favorable picture of their programs and policies , based on a wide range of sources . &amp; quot ; Sharp , however , found that 33 out of 50 citations in one chapter of Porter and Hildebrand &amp; apos ; s book derived from the Khmer Rouge government and six from China , the Khmer Rouge &amp; apos ; s principal supporter . Veteran Cambodia correspondent Nate Thayer said of Chomsky and Herman &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Nation &amp; quot ; article that they &amp; quot ; denied the credibility of information leaking out of Cambodia of a bloodbath underway and viciously attacked the authors of reportage suggesting many were suffering under the Khmer Rouge . &amp; quot ; Journalist Andrew Anthony in the London &amp; quot ; Observer &amp; quot ; , said later that the Porter and Hildebrand &amp; apos ; s book &amp; quot ; cravenly rehashed the Khmer Rouge &amp; apos ; s most outlandish lies to produce a picture of a kind of radical bucolic idyll . &amp; quot ; Chomsky , he said , questioned &amp; quot ; refugee testimony &amp; quot ; believing that &amp; quot ; their stories were exaggerations or fabrications , designed for a western media involved in a &amp; apos ; vast and unprecedented propaganda campaign &amp; apos ; against the Khmer Rouge government , &amp; apos ; including systematic distortion of the truth . &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; Beachler cited reports that Chomsky &amp; apos ; s attempts to counter charges of Khmer Rouge atrocities also consisted of writing letters to editors and publications .
He said : &amp; quot ; Examining materials in the Documentation Center of Cambodia archives , American commentator Peter Maguire found that Chomsky wrote to publishers such as Robert Silver of the New York Review of Books to urge discounting atrocity stories .
Maguire reports that some of these letters were as long as twenty pages , and that they were even sharper in tone than Chomsky ’ s published words . &amp; quot ; Journalist Fred Barnes also mentioned that Chomsky had written &amp; quot ; a letter or two &amp; quot ; to the New York Review of Books .
Barnes discussed the Khmer Rouge with Chomsky and &amp; quot ; the thrust of what he &amp; # 91 ; Chomsky &amp; # 93 ; said was that there was no evidence of mass murder &amp; quot ; in Cambodia .
Chomsky , according to Barnes , believed that &amp; quot ; tales of holocaust in Cambodia were so much propaganda . &amp; quot ; Journalist Christopher Hitchens defended Chomsky and Herman .
They &amp; quot ; were engaged in the admittedly touchy business of distinguishing evidence from interpretations . &amp; quot ; Chomsky and Herman have continued to argue that their analysis of the situation in Cambodia was reasonable based on the information available to them at the time , and a legitimate critique of the disparities in reporting atrocities committed by communist regimes relative to the atrocities committed by the U . S .
and its allies .
Nonetheless , in 1993 , Chomsky acknowledged the massive scale of the Cambodian genocide in the documentary film &amp; quot ; Manufacturing Consent &amp; quot ; .
He said , &amp; quot ; I mean the great act of genocide in the modern period is Pol Pot , 1975 through 1978 - that atrocity - I think it would be hard to find any example of a comparable outrage and outpouring of fury . &amp; quot ; Malcolm Caldwell was a British academic who wrote extensively about Cambodia , including , a few months before his death , an article in &amp; quot ; The Guardian &amp; quot ; denying reports of Khmer Rouge genocide .
Caldwell was a member of the first delegation of three Western writers , two Americans , Elizabeth Becker and Richard Dudman , and Caldwell , to be invited to visit Cambodia in December 1978 — nearly four years after the Khmer Rouge had taken power .
The invitation was apparently an effort by Pol Pot , leader of the Khmer Rouge , to improve the image of the Khmer Rouge in the West , now questioned by some of its former academic sympathizers .
On December 22 , Caldwell had a private meeting with Pol Pot and returned &amp; quot ; euphoric &amp; quot ; to the guest house in Phnom Penh where the three members of the delegation were staying .
During the night Becker awoke to the sound of gunfire and saw a Cambodian man with a gun in the guest house outside her room .
Later that night she and Dudman were allowed by guards to venture out of their rooms and they discovered Caldwell &amp; apos ; s body .
He had been shot .
The body of a Cambodian man was also in his room . The murder of Caldwell has never been fully explained .
Four of the Cambodian guards were arrested and two &amp; quot ; confessed &amp; quot ; under torture .
They said , &amp; quot ; We were attacking to ruin the Khmer Rouge Party &amp; apos ; s policy , to prevent the Party from gathering friends in the world . . .
it would be enough to attack the English guest , because the English guest had written in support of our Party . . .
Therefore , we must absolutely succeed in attacking this English guest , in order that the American guests would write about it . &amp; quot ; Whatever the motive behind Caldwell &amp; apos ; s murder , it seems highly unlikely that it could have occurred in tightly-controlled Cambodia without the involvement of high-level Khmer Rouge officials . The impact of Caldwell &amp; apos ; s visit to Cambodia and his murder was muted by the invasion of Cambodia three days later on December 25 , 1978 , which soon ended the rule of the Khmer Rouge .
Support for the Khmer Rouge in the Western academic community of Cambodian scholars quietly faded away .
Peter Rodman , an American foreign policy expert and public official , stated that &amp; quot ; When Hanoi &amp; # 91 ; Vietnam &amp; # 93 ; turned publicly against Phnom Penh , it suddenly became respectable for many on the Left to &amp; apos ; discover &amp; apos ; the murderous qualities of the Khmer Rouge — qualities that had been obvious to unbiased observers for years . &amp; quot ; With the takeover of Cambodia by Vietnam in 1979 and the discovery of incontestable evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities , including mass graves , the &amp; quot ; tales told by refugees &amp; quot ; , which had been doubted by many Western academics , proved to be entirely accurate .
Some former enthusiasts for the Khmer Rouge recanted their previous views , others diverted their interest to other issues , and a few continued to defend the Khmer Rouge . In a caustic exchange with William Shawcross in &amp; quot ; The New York Review of Books &amp; quot ; on July 20 , 1978 , Gareth Porter wrote that , &amp; quot ; It is true , as Shawcross notes from my May 1977 Congressional testimony , that I have changed my view on a number of aspects of the Cambodian situation .
I have no interest in defending everything the Khmer government does , and I believe that the policy of self-reliance has been carried so far that it has imposed unnecessary costs on the population of Cambodia .
Shawcross , however , clearly does have an interest in rejecting our conclusions .
It is time , I suggest , for him to examine it carefully , because it does not make for intellectual honesty . &amp; quot ; Shawcross responded , &amp; quot ; I was glad to acknowledge in my article that Mr .
Porter had changed his views on the Khmer Rouge and it is a tribute to his own integrity that he now agrees that the Khmer Rouge have imposed &amp; apos ; unnecessary costs &amp; apos ; on the Cambodian people .
He should , however , be a little more careful before he accuses others of deliberately falsifying evidence and of intellectual dishonesty . &amp; quot ; In 2010 , Porter said he had been waiting many years for someone to ask him about his earlier views of the Khmer Rouge .
He described how the climate of distrust of the government generated during the Vietnam war carried over to Cambodia .
&amp; quot ; I uncovered a series of instances when government officials were propagandizing &amp; # 91 ; about the Vietnam war &amp; # 93 ; .
They were lying , &amp; quot ; he explained .
&amp; quot ; I &amp; apos ; ve been well aware for many years that I was guilty of intellectual arrogance .
I was right about the bloodbath in Vietnam , so I assumed I would be right about Cambodia . &amp; quot ; Australian Ben Kiernan recanted after interviewing 500 Cambodian refugees in 1979 .
He admitted that he had been &amp; quot ; late in recognizing the extent of the tragedy in Cambodia . . .
and &amp; quot ; wrong about . . .
the brutal authoritarian trend within the revolutionary movement after 1973 . &amp; quot ; In the opinion of Donald W .
Beachler , the genocide deniers and doubters among academics may have been motivated more by politics than a search for the truth , but conservatives who &amp; quot ; embraced the reports &amp; quot ; of Khmer Rouge atrocities had no less &amp; quot ; cynicism or naiveté &amp; quot ; in later downplaying reports of atrocities by anti-communists in Central America .
He noted that the supportive attitude towards the Khmer Rouge had also been expressed by the U . S .
government and politicians for a dozen years after the regime was toppled in January 1979 , as part of the denigration against the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia in the 1980s .
In fact , the U . S .
was one of the countries that voted for the retainment of the Democratic Kampuchea &amp; apos ; s seat at the United Nations until 1991 .
Bruce Sharp , who points our many errors of Chomsky &amp; apos ; s analysis , also says that &amp; quot ; While Chomsky &amp; apos ; s comments on Cambodia are misleading and inaccurate , one important point must be borne in mind : The actions of the United States were largely responsible for the growth of the Khmer Rouge . &amp; quot ; Certain authors have continued to downplay Khmer Rouge atrocities in recent years .
Richard Dudman , who accompanied Caldwell to Cambodia , challenged the &amp; quot ; conventional wisdom that Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge are irrational fanatics who practiced deliberate genocide &amp; # 91 ; and &amp; # 93 ; slaughtered more than one million Cambodians &amp; quot ; in a 1990 &amp; quot ; New York Times &amp; quot ; editorial , arguing that &amp; quot ; The evidence for these fixed beliefs consists mainly of poignant though statistically inconclusive anecdotes from accounts of mass executions in a few villages .
It comes mostly from those with an interest in blackening the name of the Khmer Rouge : From Cambodian refugees , largely the middle- and upper-class victims of the Pol Pot revolution , and from the Vietnamese &amp; quot ; .
In 2012 , journalist Israel Shamir wrote an article titled &amp; quot ; Pol Pot Revisted &amp; quot ; for the American left-wing newsletter &amp; quot ; CounterPunch &amp; quot ; in which he argued : &amp; quot ; New Cambodia ( or Kampuchea , as it was called ) under Pol Pot and his comrades was a nightmare for the privileged , for the wealthy and for their retainers ; but poor people had enough food and were taught to read and write .
As for the mass killings , these are just horror stories , averred my Cambodian interlocutors .
Surely the victorious peasants shot marauders and spies , but many more died of American-planted mines and during the subsequent Vietnamese takeover , they said . . .
Noam Chomsky assessed that the death toll in Cambodia may have been inflated &amp; apos ; by a factor of a thousand &amp; apos ; . . . To me , this recalls other CIA-sponsored stories of Red atrocities , be it Stalin &amp; apos ; s Terror or the Ukrainian Holodomor . . .
&amp; # 91 ; The Vietnamese &amp; # 93 ; supported the black legend of genocide to justify their own bloody intervention . &amp; quot ; In 2013 , the Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen passed legislation which makes illegal the denial of the Cambodian genocide and other war crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge .
The legislation was passed after comments by a member of the opposition , Kem Sokha , who is the deputy president of the Cambodian National Rescue Party .
Sokha had stated that exhibits at Tuol Sleng were fabricated and that the artifacts had been faked by the Vietnamese following their invasion in 1979 .
Sokha &amp; apos ; s party have claimed that the comments have been taken out of context . Estimates of the number of Cambodians who died during the four years of Khmer Rouge rule have been controversial and range from less than one million to more than three million .
Kiernan , head of the Cambodian Genocide Project at Yale University , estimated that the Khmer Rouge were responsible for 1 . 5 million deaths and later raised that estimate to 1 . 7 million , more than 20 percent of the population .
His deputy , Craig Etcheson undertook the most complete survey of mass graves and evidence of executions in Cambodia and concluded in 1999 that the KR may have executed as many as 1 . 5 million people and as many as another 1 . 5 million may have died of starvation and overwork .
Kiernan criticized Etcheson for &amp; quot ; sloppiness , exaggerating a horrific death toll &amp; quot ; , and &amp; quot ; ethnic auctioneering &amp; quot ; .
Etcheson &amp; apos ; s report was removed from the web site of the Cambodian Genocide Project .
Leo Linbeck IIILeo Linbeck III is an American businessman who is involved in a variety of political and education reform efforts .
He serves as president and chief executive officer of Aquinas Companies , LLC and as executive chairman of the Linbeck Group . At the University of Notre Dame , Linbeck received a bachelor of arts from the Program of Liberal Studies ( Great Books ) and a bachelor of science in civil engineering .
He went on to receive a master of science in structural engineering from the University of Texas at Austin , and a Masters of Business Administration from the Stanford Graduate School of Business , where he was valedictorian .
At Stanford , Linbeck was also chair of the Academic Committee and founder of the Global Management Program . Early in his career , Linbeck was co-founder of the Jafy Corporation , a software development firm .
He also worked for Nishimatsu Kensetsu Kaisha in Tokyo and Osaka . Linbeck serves as CEO of Aquinas Companies , LLC .
After Linbeck joined the leadership team at the company , its annual revenues grew from $ 40 million to more than $ 500 million .
Aquinas Companies has three principal business lines : construction management ( Linbeck Group ) , real estate development ( Essex Commercial Properties ) , and early stage biotechnology development Fannin Innovation Studio ( formerly AlphaDev ) .
The Greater Houston Community Foundation owns 30 % of Aquinas Companies , LLC . Linbeck was a founder of the Collaborative Process Institute and the Lean Construction Institute .
Linbeck is also the founder of Fannin Innovation Studio , a life sciences business development studio in Houston , Texas , where he is active as a design engineer and business adviser for various life science startups . Linbeck is a lecturer at Stanford &amp; apos ; s Graduate School of Business .
He is a former adjunct business professor at Rice University &amp; apos ; s Jones Graduate School of Business . Linbeck serves as an advisor to the Knowledge is Power Program , a network of free open-enrollment college-preparatory schools in under-resourced communities throughout the United States .
In 2005 , Linbeck developed a strategic growth plan to open forty-two KIPP schools in Houston before 2017 .
In 2008 , Linbeck helped develop a credit support program with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that helped KIPP raise $ 65 million , a charter school record . Linbeck helped to create the Rice Education Entrepreneurship Program ( REEP ) , a business school program for developing school leaders . Linbeck , a self-described &amp; quot ; conservative communitarian , &amp; quot ; is the former vice-chairman of the Healthcare Compact Alliance , a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organization with a stated mission of &amp; quot ; providing tools that enable citizens to exert greater control over their government &amp; quot ; and offering Americans &amp; quot ; more influence over decisions that govern health care &amp; quot ; .
The Health Care Compact would transfer the money the federal government spends on health care to states , and give them the ability to suspend federal health care regulations .
Linbeck says : &amp; quot ; The focus of this group is governance reform — our ultimate goal is to restore self-governance .
It ’ s not nullification , it &amp; apos ; s not secession .
What it ’ s an attempt to do is to organize the states in a way that ’ s constitutional , to use an interstate compact to devolve power over health care away from a centralized federal government .
I can ’ t stand monopolies .
And what has happened in health care is an accumulation of power and control and influence in Washington D . C . , so federal politicians , big corporations , lobbyists and unions get together and cut a deal .
This is bad governance , and it has created a system that is unsustainable . &amp; quot ; Linbeck III is president of The Health Care Compact Alliance Texas nonprofit and vice chairman of its national organization .
According to the Texas tribune , the Alliance was able to raise $ 300,000 so far from different people .
It finances a lobby team and public activity .
Former Republican state Senator Kyle Janek and Texas business lobbyist Mike Toomey .
The financiers are composed of private citizens , small business owners and some political entrepreneurs support the concept of self-governance .
The Health Care Compact transfers funds the federal government allocates for health care to state governments giving them the capability to hold national healthcare policies . Linbeck is the chairman of the Competitive Governance Institute and Competitive Governance Action .
According to the group &amp; apos ; s mission statement , Competitive Governance Action &amp; quot ; exists to challenge the increasing domination of decision-making in Washington that disenfranchises ordinary citizens , protects incumbents from challenges to their power and position , and allows career politicians to avoid accountability for their actions . &amp; quot ; The group &amp; apos ; s efforts include a &amp; quot ; Primary Pledge &amp; quot ; to encourage citizens to vote in primary elections , support for interstate compacts , including the Health Care Compact , and organization of a coalition to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution . Linbeck is the co-founder and top donor of the Campaign for Primary Accountability ( CPA ) , a Super PAC with a stated goal of bringing &amp; quot ; true competition to our electoral process , to give voters real information about their choices , and to restore fair , not fixed , elections . &amp; quot ; CPA was featured in a front-page story in the &amp; quot ; Washington Post &amp; quot ; on March 8 , 2012 .
The story quotes Linbeck as saying , &amp; quot ; We ’ re trying to make the electoral system competitive , so that Congress will become more accountable to the voters .
It ’ s not about policy , it ’ s about governance .
We ’ re not interested in shifting power between Republicans and Democrats .
We ’ re interested in shifting power between Congress and the people . &amp; quot ; According to a &amp; quot ; Mother Jones &amp; quot ; article published in March 2012 , &amp; quot ; the group &amp; apos ; s aim is to use the power of the purse to do what political parties and state redistricting panels won &amp; apos ; t — make congressional races competitive again .
CFPA , which has raised $ 1 . 8 million to date , is targeting at least 10 Republican and Democratic incumbents in half a dozen states , with plans to increase that number over the next few months . &amp; quot ; The organization attracted national attention after the March 6 , 2012 , congressional primary in Ohio &amp; apos ; s 2nd District when it played a role in defeating incumbent Jean Schmidt .
CPA attracted renewed attention when it played a role in incumbent Donald A .
Manzullo &amp; apos ; s defeat in the March 20 , 2012 , congressional primary in Illinois &amp; apos ; 16th District . According to the &amp; quot ; Dallas Morning News &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Most so-called Super PACs created in the wake of the Supreme Court ’ s Citizens United decision push specific candidates , values or policy positions .
But a Texas-based group , the Campaign for Primary Accountability , has a far more unique goal : make life more difficult for more congressional incumbents .
CPA is targeting incumbents for primary defeat across the nation , using a bankroll that has grown to about $ 1 . 8 million to fund challengers to Republicans and Democrats the Super PAC believes has lost touch with the people of their districts . &amp; quot ; In January 2013 , Linbeck wrote an opinion editorial in &amp; quot ; Politico &amp; quot ; stating that CPA would continue to be active in the 2014 congressional elections . Linbeck sits on the boards of the Texas Families First Coalition , Families Empowered , the Free Enterprise Institute , the Greater Houston Community Foundation , Seton Education Partners , Pathways for Little Feet , the Holocaust Museum Houston , and the Methodist Hospital Research Institute .
He is a member of the University of Texas Civil , Architectural and Environmental Engineering Department External Advisory Committee .
Linbeck serves on the advisory board of the University of Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture and the Positive Coaching Alliance . Linbeck was a Henry Ford II Scholar at Stanford , where he also won the Arbuckle Award .
He is a two-time winner of the Alumni Teaching Award at Rice University &amp; apos ; s Jones Business School .
Linbeck was inducted into the Academy of Distinguished Alumni in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Texas .

Feelings ( Johnny Mathis album ) Feelings is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released on October 20 , 1975 , by Columbia Records and strayed slightly from the practice of covering hits by other artists to include two new songs , both of which were written by Jerry Fuller : &amp; quot ; Hurry Mother Nature &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; That &amp; apos ; s All She Wrote &amp; quot ; , which Ray Price took to number 34 on the Country chart the following spring . The album made its first appearance on &amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; magazine &amp; apos ; s Top LP &amp; apos ; s &amp; amp ; Tapes chart in the issue dated November 8 , 1975 , and remained there for 21 weeks , peaking at number 97 .
On February 1 , 1976 , the British Phonographic Industry awarded the album with Silver certification for sales of 60,000 units .
It received Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America on December 30 , 1980 . The first single from the album , &amp; quot ; Stardust &amp; quot ; , entered &amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; &amp; apos ; s list of the 50 most popular Easy Listening songs in the US in the issue of the magazine dated November 29 , 1975 , and peaked at number four over the course of 12 weeks .
&amp; quot ; One Day in Your Life &amp; quot ; was released as the follow-up and entered that same chart in the March 13 , 1976 , issue , eventually getting as high as number 36 during its five weeks there . &amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; liked what they heard .
&amp; quot ; Covering other people &amp; apos ; s hits can be dangerous , but not for Mathis , who is in the right mood , tempo and vocal range this time around . &amp; quot ; AllMusic &amp; apos ; s Ed Hogan wrote a brief but positive review .
&amp; quot ; Produced by Jack Gold with great arrangements by Gene Page , &amp; quot ; Feelings &amp; quot ; is one of Johnny Mathis &amp; apos ; s best &amp; apos ; 70s era albums . &amp; quot ; This album &amp; apos ; s CD release as part of the 2017 box set &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; included two bonus tracks that were previously unavailable : From the liner notes for &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; : The histories of some of the selections that Mathis made for this album are quite varied .
Michael Jackson recorded &amp; quot ; One Day in Your Life &amp; quot ; before this album was released in 1975 , but his recording was not available as a single until 1981 .
&amp; quot ; Stardust &amp; quot ; reached the charts 15 times through various recordings between 1930 and 1943 . Jack Jones had a number 25 Easy Listening hit with &amp; quot ; What I Did for Love &amp; quot ; , which originated in the 1975 Broadway musical &amp; quot ; A Chorus Line &amp; quot ; .
Melissa Manchester &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Midnight Blue &amp; quot ; spent two weeks at number one on the Easy Listening chart in addition to reaching number six on the &amp; quot ; Billboard &amp; quot ; Hot 100 .
And &amp; quot ; The Greatest Gift &amp; quot ; was performed by an unnamed chorus for the soundtrack of the 1975 film &amp; quot ; The Return of the Pink Panther &amp; quot ; .
Albert Hammond &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; 99 Miles From L . A . &amp; quot ; is another number one Easy Listening hit that Mathis covers here , although the song only managed a number 91 showing on the pop chart .
&amp; quot ; Feelings &amp; quot ; by Morris Albert fared much better on the Hot 100 , making it to number six , in addition to peaking at number two Easy Listening and number four UK and receiving Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America .
And &amp; quot ; Solitaire &amp; quot ; had its best chart performance in the US as a number one Easy Listening hit for The Carpenters that also got as high as number 17 pop , but their number 32 performance with the song on the UK singles chart in 1975 fell far short of the number four position that Andy Williams attained with his version on that same chart two years earlier .

Zamorano EightyThe Zamorano Eighty is a list of books intended to represent the most significant early volumes published on the history of California .
It was compiled in 1945 by members of the Zamorano Club , a Los Angeles-based group of bibliophiles .
Collecting first editions of every volume on the list has become the goal of a number of book collectors , though to date only four people have completed the task . The Zamorano Club was founded in 1928 and named for Agustín Vicente Zamorano , the first printer in California .
A series of committees of Club members , including former American Smelting and Refining Company executive Henry Raup Wagner and bibliographer Robert Cowan , assembled a list of a hundred books , eventually whittled down to eighty .
During this process , Cowan died , and his &amp; quot ; Bibliography of the History of California and the Pacific West &amp; quot ; was added to the list as a tribute . The list contains significant works by a number of well-known authors like Mark Twain , John Muir , Bret Harte , and Robert Louis Stevenson , as well as obscure texts concerning geographical exploration and legal matters .
Some of the works exist in very few , highly sought after copies , while others were quite common and not particularly valuable , until interest in the list caused their prices to rise .
Book dealers often refer to items for sale using their &amp; quot ; Zamorano number &amp; quot ; or have special sections dedicated to items on the list . Thomas Streeter was the first collector to assemble a complete collection of first editions of every item on the list .
His collection was auctioned between 1966 and 1969 .
Businessman Frederick William Beinecke was the second .
Retired investment counselor Henry H .
Clifford completed his collection in 1988 and his collection was auctioned in 1995 .
The fourth was architect Daniel Volkmann , who completed his collection in 1994 , and it was auctioned in 2003 .
Many other collectors have pursued this goal , including notorious bibliomane and book thief Stephen Blumberg . Only one institution , the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University , possesses a complete collection of the Zamorano 80 , donated by Frederick W .
Beinecke .
Both the Bancroft Library at the University of California , Berkeley and the Huntington Library in San Marino , California possess all but one of the volumes . The rarest book on the list is number 64 , the dime novel &amp; quot ; The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta &amp; quot ; by John Rollin Ridge writing as &amp; quot ; Yellow Bird &amp; quot ; .
Only two first-edition copies are known to exist , each used twice to complete the list .
It may be on the list only because Wagner owned a copy , which he sold to Streeter .
When Streeter &amp; apos ; s collection was being periodically auctioned , the auction of this copy was moved up over a year so the elderly Beinecke would be able to complete his Zamorano collection .
This copy is now in the Beinecke Library with the rest of Beinecke &amp; apos ; s Zamorano books .
Clifford purchased the second copy from a collector in Maine , which in turn was purchased by Volkmann at the auction of Clifford &amp; apos ; s collection .
The book has been described with terms like &amp; quot ; Holy Grail &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; rara avis &amp; quot ; and is highly desired by collectors .
Blumberg wanted it so much he and his accomplices planned and researched a potential burglary of Clifford &amp; apos ; s house when that collector owned the book .
The works on the list are numbered in alphabetical order by author ( or title , in the case of numbers 14 , 35 , and 62 ) and were not intended to be any sort of ranking of literary or financial value .
National Centre for Foreign Animal DiseaseThe National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease ( NCFAD ) , located in the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health in Winnipeg , Manitoba , is part of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ’ s National Centres for Animal Disease .
NCFAD is co-located with the Public Health Agency of Canada ’ s National Microbiology Laboratory . NCFAD provides state-of-the-art scientific expertise and technologies for the prevention , detection , control and reporting of foreign animal diseases ( FAD ) and emerging animal diseases .
The lab has diagnostic capabilities for a large number of FADs including , but not limited to : avian influenza , foot-and-mouth disease , classical swine fever , and Nipah and Hendra virus infections . The NCFAD has received designations by the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) e as a reference laboratory for both highly pathogenic avian influenza and for classical swine fever , in recognition of excellence in diagnostic competency , test method development , validation , research , collaboration and training .
The NCFAD is also accredited to the international quality standard , ISO / IEC 17025 for both diagnostics and research .
ISO accreditation means that an international level of standardization has been met ; this ensures state-of-the-art technology , worldwide compatibility and competence in diagnostic and research activities . The mandate of the NCFAD is to provide scientific and laboratory services for the rapid and accurate identification and reporting of foreign animal diseases .
The lab has five main functions : Testing services ; technology development and research ; training ; scientific advice ; and international consultation . NCFAD staff are experts in tests to detect FAD agents , and they perform many of these tests on a routine basis to meet requirements for import , export , and domestic disease control - including surveillance , the provision of confirmatory testing of suspect material , and reference laboratory services .
NCFAD scientists also undertake research to develop better testing technologies for FADs .
Staff also serve on international committees ; maintain international linkages and collaborations with FAD experts in other countries ; and provide training to veterinarians , graduate students , and technologists . One of the methods for providing this training is through a specialized annual course that focuses on FAD recognition , diagnosis and pathogenesis ( the origins and development of disease and the mechanisms that cause disease ) .
It is the only facility in Canada that is equipped to present this course .
Participants include CFIA field veterinarians , veterinary pathologists from Canada ’ s teaching colleges , and veterinary diagnosticians from provincial laboratories . NCFAD is organized into several Sections and Units : Classical Swine Fever / Avian Influenza – This Section provides diagnostic testing services , technology development , research , training , and scientific consultation services .
Diseases of primary concern are : classical swine fever , African swine fever , Newcastle disease , and notifiable avian influenza .
This Section has expertise in the detection , isolation , identification , sequencing and characterization of viruses using conventional and molecular techniques .
In addition to OIE Reference Laboratory status for classical swine fever and avian influenza , this Section is also the National Reference Laboratory and as such aides coordination of the network of provincial / university diagnostic animal health laboratories across Canada . Vesicular Diseases – This Section provides testing services , technology development and research , training , and scientific consultation services for vesicular diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease , swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis .
This Section is also involved in the study of host responses , disease transmission and pathogenesis of vesicular diseases .
Both in vivo and in vitro work is carried out under strict containment conditions . Serology / Immunology – This Section conducts both scheduled and special tests for the detection of antibodies to foreign animal disease agents in addition to assay development , validation , training and scientific consultation services .
The bulk of scheduled tests ( avian influenza , Newcastle disease , bluetongue , pseudorabies , vesicular stomatitis and epizootic hemorrhagic disease ) involve the use of validated test methods on traditional farm animal species and the qualification of these animals or their products for movement into , out of , or within Canada and in support of national sero-surveys required by Canada ’ s trading partners and the OIE to maintain the country ’ s disease-free status .
The Section provides this service for NCFAD as well as for the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network ( CAHSN ) . Zoonotics / Emerging Diseases ( Special Pathogens ) – This is the Containment Level 4 ( CL4 ) Section of NCFAD .
CL4 is where scientists can work safely with the most serious viruses .
The Section provides expertise in the area of special pathogens , particularly the CL4 agents and zoonotic containment level 3 agents of veterinary importance such as Nipah virus , Hendra virus , Ebola virus and Rift Valley fever virus .
The Section maintains a state of readiness for emergencies or outbreak situations through research , technical development , training and scientific consultation .
Protected by positive pressure suits , bench work with infectious agents is conducted in a highly specialized CFIA containment level 4 laboratory .
Attached directly to this laboratory is a containment cubicle that allows work with large animals under the CL4 conditions .
The staff members receive extensive training prior to work in CL4 and CL3 zoonotic . Reagent Development - The Reagent Development Section has expertise in the characterization and production of reagents used in diagnostic testing and research to ensure efficient and reliable supply of high quality reagents and cells for use in diagnostic testing and research .
The mandate for the reagent development unit is to provide three core services to NCFAD .
These services involve the production and characterization of : 1 ) monoclonal antibodies 2 ) recombinant proteins and 3 ) mammalian , avian and insect cells .
Each of the services is provided by research and technical staff who specialize in up-to-date technologies relating to the efficient productions of quality reagents . Pathology – The Pathology Section at the NCFAD delivers diagnostic services by conducting histopathological , electron microscopical and immunohistochemical tests for the diagnosis of a broad range of infectious animal diseases foreign to Canada .
The unit also investigates the pathogenesis of foreign animal and emerging diseases , for example : avian influenza , Nipah virus infection , Rift Valley fever , capripox , lumpy skin disease , glanders , and classical swine fever . Animal Care – The Animal Care Unit collaborates in diagnostic and research activities involving the use of animals .
This unit is involved in assays for the determination of pathogenicity indices for avian viruses , the production of serum standards for diagnostic test methods , and research projects on disease pathogenesis .
NCFAD primarily works with farm animals such as pigs , chickens and cattle in order to carry out its mandate .
The Animal Care Unit consists of a veterinarian and laboratory animal technologists .
This unit is devoted to the best possible care for the animals and ensures that all animal use meets or exceeds the guidelines established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care ( CCAC ) . In the 1980s , Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada identified both the need for new laboratories including high-containment space ( Containment Level 3 and 4 ) .
Around the same time , Health Canada was also considering the need to replace outdated laboratories and add Containment Level 4 .
Numerous benefits were identified for housing both laboratories in one building and Winnipeg was chosen as the site ; an announcement was made in October 1987 . After some debate , the spot chosen for the site was a city works yard near to the Health Sciences Centre ( a major teaching hospital ) , the University of Manitoba ’ s medical school , and other life science organizations .
Construction of the facility that came to be named the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health ( often referred to locally as “ the Virology Lab ” ) began with an official groundbreaking in December 1992 .
The design team , headed by the Winnipeg-based Smith Carter Architects and Engineers Inc . , visited 30 laboratories to seek best practices in containment and design .
Construction finished toward the end of 1997 with the first programs beginning in the spring of 1998 and all laboratories coming on line after that .
The official opening took place in 1999 . By the time the animal health programs began moving into the new facility , they had become part of the new Canadian Food Inspection Agency .
The agency was created in April 1997 by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act for the purpose of combining and integrating the related inspection services of three separate federal government departments : Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada , Fisheries and Oceans Canada , and Health Canada .
The establishment of the CFIA consolidated the delivery of all federal food safety , animal health , and plant health regulatory programs . In addition to operating a Containment Level ( CL ) 2 laboratory as well as extensive CL3 laboratories , NCFAD also operates a Containment Level 4 laboratory , which provides the capability to work safely with the most serious viruses .
A Level 4 laboratory is designed for agents that usually produce very serious and untreatable diseases , which can be spread easily through airborne or casual contact .
All animal diseases classed as Level 4 are zoonotic , meaning that they can transfer to humans .
Staff wear pressurized biosafety suits which are disinfected after each session .
All air and waste are sterilized on exit . NCFAD maintains a staff of approximately 65 people ; primarily scientists and laboratory technicians . www . inspection . gc . ca

Peters FashionsPeters Fashions , also known as Peters Of Huddersfield , is a family run department store in the market town of Huddersfield , West Yorkshire , England . The business has its origins in the department store Kayes , founded in 1863 .
Ernest Whittle was joint managing director of Kayes until his death in 1976 , when his sons Alan and Peter took over .
In April 1982 , Kayes , citing the recession and issues with town centre parking , announced their King Street store would close in July with a loss of 100 jobs .
Peter Whittle who had worked at Kayes since 1948 used his share of the business to launch a store bearing his name ; Peters . The store ran successfully for many years and remained a family business .
Peter retired from the day-to-day running of the company and became company Chairman in 1991 .
His son David and daughter-in-law Caroline took over the running of the company upon his retirement .
In 2001 Wolverhampton-based James Beattie opened a department store in the Kingsgate Centre and this , coupled with losses from the cookshop and cashflow difficulties relating to difficult market conditions saw Peters placed in the hands of administrators , Kroll , in February 2006 after revealing losses of £ 312,000 on a gross turnover of £ 3m . The Whittle family left the business and the administrators decided that the business was able to be saved and ran it as a going concern .
Later in 2006 the Whittles with backing from one of their concession partners , Stephen Buck , were able to bring the store out of administration and resuming trading . The BBC made a television documentary series of three programmes , entitled &amp; apos ; The Department Store &amp; apos ; .
Produced by Richard Macer , it was about independent department stores and how they are surviving in the modern world in the face of stiff competition from chain stores .
The second programme in the series , on Peters , was shown on BBC Four on 24 November 2008 and followed David and Caroline Whittle for six months as they attempted to turn around the stores fortunes . In September 2010 , the Whittle family were able to regain control of the store , although this move was not widely broadcast at the time given the stores recent history and the couple &amp; apos ; s regret at having had to make people redundant in the past .
The next generation of the family , Jonathan and Joseph Whittle have already been working for the firm and both are studying for business qualifications . The company has now re-launched and undergone a full re-brand including website and social media overhauls and is trading in fashion and accessories alongside operating a coffee shop .

Divertimento in G major ( Haydn ) The Divertimento in G major , Hob .
XVI / 8 , L .
1 , was written in 1766 by Joseph Haydn . The keyboard divertimento resembles the sonata , but its purpose was more for entertainment .
Haydn ’ s divertimentos tend to have three movements in a quick-slow-quick form , but the 18th century divertimento can have up to nine movements .
The opening and closing allegro movements are usually in sonata form and are characteristically galant .
Georg Feder groups this divertimento with nine others , calling them , “ Nine small early sonatas . ” Feder believes Haydn wrote them for his students or amateurs , as they are not technically challenging . In a letter from Haydn to the Prince Nikolaus Esterházy on December 6 , 1766 , Haydn references six new divertimenti that he had composed .
This divertimento , seeing as it is classified by Landon as Divertimento No .
1 , might be among the divertimenti that he is referencing : The work has four movements : The piece is scored for harpsichord .
The first movement is an abbreviated sonata form in 2 / 4 time , and is 44 measures long .
It follows the pattern of modulation from tonic to dominant in the first section , with a ten bar central section before the recapitulation of the original material in G major .
The movement is lively and has a two-voice texture .
It presents rhythmic challenges such as triplets surrounded by duplets and off-beat patterns , and also features contrapuntal lines and sixteenth note triplets . The second movement is a minuet without the trio , in standard 3 / 4 time , and is a brief 16 measures in length .
It has rhythmic complexity ; in the first four measures half notes , quarter notes , eighth notes , eighth note triplets and sixteenth notes are all encountered . The third movement is a short , 9 measure andante in common time , where the first half of the piece is composed of four bars which are repeated once , and the second half comprises five bars which are also repeated .
It is melodic and well balanced and also features contrapuntal lines . The allegro finale is in 3 / 8 time and is 24 measures long .
It is also composed of two halves , which are both repeated once .
It is described as a fast and jocund movement , and is a good study in finger independence and facility .
It features broken interval figuration , octaves , and both sustained and moving notes .

Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus , SyracuseThe Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus is a Catholic parish church and minor basilica in Syracuse , New York .
It is located at 927 Park Avenue in the Westside neighborhood .
The building was designated a minor basilica by Pope John Paul II on August 27 , 1998 and dedicated on October 3 , 1999 . The church was founded in 1892 as Sacred Heart Parish in the Westside , a neighborhood with a large Polish population , after the Polish community petitioned Syracuse &amp; apos ; s bishop for a parish of its own .
The original church was located across the street from the current structure .
The first Mass in the new parish church was said on August 30 , 1892 , with the formal dedication taking place nearly a year later on June 11 , 1893 . The congregation outgrew the first church within a decade , and a decision was made to construct a new church .
The foundations were built by parishioners in order to save money , and the cornerstone was laid in 1907 .
Work was completed in three years and the church was completed and dedicated on June 5 , 1910 by the Polish-born auxiliary bishop of Chicago Paul Peter Rhode . Following the construction of the new church building , the old church building was converted into a parochial school .
That structure burned in a fire in 1916 and was replaced by a larger brick school .
The new building expanded again in 1926 , to accommodate the continued growth of the parish , and further community buildings were added up to the 1940s .
Sacred Heart High School closed in June 1975 .
A decision was made to close the parish school in 2002 because of declining enrollment . In July of 2017 , the Basilica celebrated 125 years as a parish church .
The Basilica is currently in the middle of a project to install a new pipe organ .
The new organ is a 1927 Skinner Organ , Opus 669 .
The Skinner organ was originally built and installed at the First Church of Christ - Scientist on Genesee St .
in downtown Syracuse , which closed in 2003 .
The Skinner organ is replacing a smaller Moller organ , that had been built and installed in the Basilica in 1910 .
The Moller organ had fallen into disrepair , and needed to be replaced . The cruciform building was designed by Syracuse architects Merrick and Randall , and built in stone with a marble veneer in Gothic Revival style .
With a capacity of 1,200 , it is long and across at its widest point .
Its two spires are high . The church features a series of fine stained glass windows from Munich , the Henry Keck Stained Glass Studio in Syracuse and from St Louis .
One stained glass window depicts Polish saint Maximilian Kolbe , who died at Auschwitz .
It contains a 1910 Möller organ .
That organ is being replaced during the spring of 2018 .
The original asphalt-shingled roof was replaced in 2009 with slate and copper , in order to ensure longevity . Pope John Paul II issued a Papal bull to elevate Sacred Heart to a minor basilica in 1998 .
The formal dedication took place on October 3 , 1999 , with Syracuse Bishop James Moynihan reading the Papal bull and Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Costello acting as Celebrant .

Not to be left out , Scooby and Shaggy decide to show Pimiento a juggling act , which they are betting will take the contest by storm .
However , after Pimiento states his belief that ‘ juggling stinks , &amp; apos ; throughout the film , the two continually approach Pimiento and show him numerous terrible impromptu acts . Not long after checking in for the talent show , the Phantom appears in the opera house and Fred , Daphne and Velma attempt to catch him using the surveillance cameras , but are unsuccessful due to the Phantom ’ s ability to seemingly appear in multiple places at once .
While being chased briefly by the Phantom , Shaggy and Scooby notice the Phantom had a strange lemon scent and afterwards , the gang split up to search for clues .
Fred and Daphne meet the owner of the opera house , Mel Richmond .
They learn from Richmond that a Phantom once terrorized the opera house thirty-five years ago when it was a disco . The dress rehearsal commences the next day .
Fred and Daphne meet Emma ’ s parents , who are hoping to get the prize money to save their home from bankruptcy .
During the dress rehearsal , the Phantom sabotages most of the finalists ’ acts , leaving Christine , Emma , and Fred and Daphne as the only contestants left .
Due to these attacks , Fred and Daphne decide to use themselves as bait to lure the Phantom out .
The gang manage to track down a Phantom , only to find it is the original Phantom from the 70 ’ s , a man named Steve Trilby .
Steve admits to the gang that he vandalized the opera house during the 70 ’ s , due to his hatred over disco music , but that now he only goes into the opera house to get food .
The gang return to the stage to find the Phantom setting fire to the opera house .
With the help of Steve , they catch the Phantom , who is revealed to be Mel Richmond .
However , the gang learn that Richmond isn &amp; apos ; t the Phantom they are after when they hear the Phantom threatening to destroy the place unless Christine wins . Later that night , using Emma as bait , the gang manage to capture the Phantom , who turns out to be Christine ’ s father , Lance .
Afterwards , however , Shaggy and Scooby find out that Ottoman is also the Phantom , when they see him putting on lemon-scented hand sanitizer .
They rush to Ottoman ’ s office and find a magazine about the Soap Diamond , which is on display at a mineralogical center nearby .
They quickly realize Ottoman ordered all the police to patrol the opera house so that the mineralogical center would be unguarded .
They rush to the mineralogical center and find Ottoman running out of the building .
Ottoman trips and drops the Soap Diamond , which Scooby catches .
Ottoman pursues the gang toward a drawbridge , where Fred tricks him into jumping into a barge filled with garbage , by replacing the diamond with a dog bone .
Ottoman is arrested and the gang goes back to the opera house , after being informed that Fred and Daphne are doing a tie-breaking performance against Emma . The gang arrives back in time for Fred and Daphne to do their tie-breaker performance .
The performance takes them in the lead of the voting chart , however , when they realize what it would mean if Emma lost , they decide to tell some of Shaggy and Scooby ’ s cheesy jokes , which enables them to lose enough votes , allowing Emma to win .
At the end of the show , Velma plays the footage which shows Pimiento putting on the Phantom costume .
Pimiento admits that he used the Phantom to boost the show ’ s ratings .
After Pimento is taken away , Steve wraps up the show . &amp; quot ; DVD Verdict &amp; quot ; offered that the plot was an unoriginal &amp; quot ; rip-off of the classic &amp; quot ; The Phantom of the Opera &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; mixed with &amp; quot ; overtones of &amp; quot ; American Idol &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; as well as other &amp; quot ; reality based music shows &amp; quot ; .
They also offered that while Blu-ray quality gives the film a ghoulish quality , it would be scary to only the youngest viewers .
They noted Frank Welker as the voice of Fred , being the only holdover from the original series , and Matthew Lillard &amp; apos ; s return as the voice of Shaggy .
They also offered that Mindy Cohn &amp; quot ; fits in well as nerdy Velma &amp; quot ; and that Vivica A .
Fox , Peter MacNicol , and Wayne Brady in supporting roles &amp; quot ; make the film slightly more interesting for adults who want to play the &amp; apos ; is that so-and-so &amp; apos ; s voice ? &amp; apos ; game . &amp; quot ; They concluded that for children , the film &amp; quot ; will probably be a lot of fun and somewhat thrilling &amp; quot ; , due to the car and foot chases and its various adventures , but that &amp; quot ; adults will find it to be a bit tedious , but if that surprises you , clearly you haven &amp; apos ; t spent much time around children &amp; apos ; s entertainment . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Scooby-Doo ! WrestleMania Mystery &amp; quot ; was released on March 25 , 2014 .
Prediction and Research Moored Array in the AtlanticThe Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Atlantic , also known as PIRATA , is a system of moored observation buoys in the tropical Atlantic Ocean which collect meteorological and oceanographic data .
The data collected by the PIRATA array helps scientists to better understand climatic events in the Tropical Atlantic and to improve weather forecasting and climate research worldwide .
Climatic and oceanic events in the tropical Atlantic , such as the Tropical Atlantic SST Dipole affect rainfall and climate in both West Africa and Northeast Brazil .
The northern tropical Atlantic is also a major formation area for hurricanes affecting the West Indies and the United States .
Alongside the RAMA array in the Indian Ocean and the TAO / TRITON network in the Pacific Ocean , PIRATA forms part of the worldwide system of tropical ocean observing buoys . The project is a tripartite cooperation between Brazil , France and the United States .
The principal agencies involved are NOAA in the United States , IRD and Météo-France of France plus INPE and DHN from Brazil . The PIRATA buoy network consists of seventeen Autonomous Temperature Line Acquesition System , or ATLAS , buoys .
Twelve buoys were originally deployed in 1997 .
Two of these buoys were decommissioned in 1999 because of vandalism by fishing craft .
Three extensions of the original network have been added .
Three buoys were deployed off the coast of Brazil in 2005 and four more in 2006 / 2007 to extend coverage to the north and the north-east .
As a demonstration exercise one buoy was deployed to the south-east of the region , off the coast of Africa , between June 2006 and June 2007 . In addition to the ATLAS buoys , PIRATA has three island based meteorological stations , one at Fernando de Noronha , another on the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago and one on São Tomé .
A tidal gauge is also maintained at São Tomé .
Dedicated hydrographic cruises and annual buoy maintenance voyages are also undertaken under the auspices of the PIRATA project . Each ATLAS buoy measuresIn addition one buoy has an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler fitted alongside to measure water current velocities and four buoys are equipped to measure net heat flux . Daily mean observations from the ATLAS buoys are received in near real time via both the Argos System and Brazilian satellites .
The data is processed by the TAO Project Office of NOAA and also placed on the Global Telecommunications System for real time distribution to weather centres and other users .
High frequency measurements are stored on the buoys and retrieved during maintenance operations .
The array provides 4,000 to 4,500 unique hourly values per month .

Pinchas GoldharPinchas Goldhar ( 14 June 1901 – 25 January 1947 ) was a Polish and then Australian writer and translator , who wrote mainly in the Yiddish language . Pinchas Goldhar was born in Lodz , Poland , then part of Russia , on 14 June 1901 , the oldest of four siblings of Jacob Goldhar ( 1878 - 1945 ) , a dyer , and Rachel Goldhar ( née Hirshkowitz ) .
Pinchas had a Jewish high school and university education . By 1922 Goldhar was working for the daily Lodz Yiddish newspaper &amp; quot ; Lodzer Tageblatt &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; The Lodz Daily &amp; quot ; ) .
Around this time Yiddish literature was experiencing somewhat of a renaissance in Poland , and Goldhar quickly became a Yiddish writer of note .
He translated many German and French novels into Yiddish .
One of the stories he translated was The Weavers by the German writer Gerhart Hauptmann .
After Goldhar translated this story it became a favorite of the Yiddish stage . In Poland anti-Semitism was increasing , and to escape it , Jacob Goldhar , now a widower , took his four children to Australia in 1926 .
By 1928 the family was settled in Melbourne , Victoria , and Jacob Goldhar started a small dyeing business , in which Pinchas initially joined . On 16 June 1931 , Goldhar became inaugural editor for about three years of the first Yiddish newspaper in Australia .
The name of the paper was &amp; quot ; Australier Leben &amp; quot ; ( &amp; quot ; Australian Life &amp; quot ; ) and was produced at the time by printer and stationer David Altshul until 1933 , when the newspaper was sold to Leslie Rubinstein .
In 1937 Goldhar contributed to the first Yiddish book published in Australia , the &amp; quot ; Australian Jewish Almanac &amp; quot ; .
In 1939 he contributed to the second published book &amp; quot ; Stories from Australia &amp; quot ; .
These books attracted worldwide reviews and even caught the attention of Bashevis Singer , a favorable noted critique .
Some of the stories that were written have been translated into modern day English . In 1934 , Goldhar married Ida Shlezynger and they had three children .
He died of a coronary thrombosis on 25 January 1947 . Throughout his life Goldhar translated many stories including those of Henry Lawson , Susannah Pritchard , Frank Dalby Davison , Alan Marshall and Vance Palmer .
He was very interested in the quality at which the Australian literature was written .
His essay about Australian literature was later translated by Nita Bluthal and Stephen Murray-Smith and published in the Melbourne University Magazine in 1947 .
Also throughout his life he built a circle of friends , both Jewish and non-Jewish .
Arpeggio of Blue SteelDue to global warming and rising sea levels in the early 21st century , much of Earth &amp; apos ; s landmass has been lost .
In 2039 , fleets of powerful sentient warships , armed with advanced technology and possibly &amp; apos ; alien &amp; apos ; weaponry , mysteriously appear and devastate the world &amp; apos ; s naval forces .
These ships , collectively called as &amp; apos ; The Fleet of Fog &amp; apos ; , impose a worldwide naval and aerial blockade , preventing humanity from both traveling the oceans and to other nations .
During the blockade , the Fleet of Fog created Mental Models , humanoid avatars containing a ship &amp; apos ; s Union core , as a means to develop self cultivation and to overcome their lack of creative thinking of tactics that humans possessed , which at the same time made the Mental Models develop their own unique personality . In 2056 , 17 years after the blockade began , Gunzō Chihaya , a former student of the Japanese National Marine Academy , is the captain of a small group of privateers called the &amp; apos ; Blue Steel &amp; apos ; .
The Blue Steel are infamous for possessing a Fog submarine , the I-401 , along with its Mental Model Iona , who defected to the human side .
Due to I-401 &amp; apos ; s technology and Gunzō &amp; apos ; s tactical skills , the Blue Steel have not only survived several encounters with the Fleet of Fog but managed to sink one of their most powerful warships . Gunzō and his crew are hired by a faction of the Japanese government to deliver the prototype of the vibration warhead , a powerful weapon that may finally allow mankind to fight back against the Fog , to the United States .
The United States is the only country with the resources and capability to mass-produce the weapon system .
However , the Blue Steel will face obstacles on their journey not only from the Fleet of Fog and their human allies , but from other governments and factions with their own agendas .
Along the way they will also gain allies of their own from both sides , increasing their chances against seemingly overwhelming odds . As a result of the blockade by the Fleet of Fog , both the Japanese government and Self-Defense Forces were reorganized .
The country was decentralized into three districts ( Northern Japan , Hokkaido , Central Japan , Honshu and Southern Japan , Kyushu ) with each district led by a prime minister who deal with their own local affairs while making important decisions together for the entire nation .
The JSDF became an actual military force with an Army , Navy and Air Force .
The remnants of United States Forces Japan that were left stranded after the Fleet of Fog blockade were absorbed into the Japanese Military where many American servicemen ended up marrying Japanese nationals and starting families . This is the Fleet of Fog stationed in the Japanese territorial waters .
They formed a blockade around Japan to prevent any human vessels and aircraft from fleeing to the open sea .
There are 2 patrol fleets maintaining the blockade , the First and the Second Oriental Fleet .
But when they found out that I-401 sinks Hyūga , the flagship of the Second Oriental Fleet , they are forced to reorganize , leaving a hole in the blockade .
After they reorganize , Kongō is the new flagship of the Second Fleet while Nagato is the new flagship of the First Fleet . The manga began serialization in September 30 , 2009 in Shōnen Gahōsha &amp; apos ; s Young King OURs magazine .

William Henry Furness IIIWilliam Henry Furness III ( August 10 , 1866 – August 11 , 1920 ) was an American physician , ethnographer and author from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
He was among the first to study and photograph the Kayan people of Borneo and the Wa &amp; apos ; ab people on the island of Yap . He was the grandson and namesake of Unitarian theologian William Henry Furness , and the son of Shakespearean scholar Horace Howard Furness .
He attended St .
Paul &amp; apos ; s School ( Class of 1883 ) , Harvard University ( Class of 1888 ) , and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in 1891 .
He was one of the medical students portrayed in the Thomas Eakins painting &amp; quot ; The Agnew Clinic &amp; quot ; . Furness made four expeditions to Southeast Asia and Oceania between 1895 and 1901 , accompanied by Hiram M .
Hiller , Jr .
and Alfred C .
Harrison , Jr .
The trio collected ethnographic , archaeological , and skeletal material , and Furness and Harrison took photographs .
These artifacts were among the founding collections of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology .
Zoological specimens – mostly fish and birds – were donated to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia .
Duplicate objects were donated to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University . He returned to the South Pacific in 1903 , and spent two months among the Wa &amp; apos ; ab people on the island of Uap ( Yap ) .
He wrote about their use of rai stones – doughnut-shaped limestone discs – as money .
As a coral island , Uap had no natural stone , and most of the rai came from Palau , an island some 280 miles ( 450 k ) away .
A rai with a diameter of about 1 foot ( 30 . 5 cm ) was enough to purchase a full-grown pig , but some had diameters as large as 12 feet ( 3 . 66 m ) . Rai was a currency that represented genuine labor – it had to be mined and carved on Palau , transported hundreds of miles by outrigger canoe or raft , and on Uap a team of twenty men was required to move the largest ones about .
Utilizing a phonograph , Furness recorded Wa &amp; apos ; ab speech and native songs , and published the first Uapese-to-English / English-to-Uapese dictionary . Furness served as curator of the University of Pennsylvania Museum &amp; apos ; s general ethnology section , 1903-05 .
At home in Wallingford , Pennsylvania , he raised chimpanzees and orangutans , and experimented with teaching them rudimentary human speech : &amp; quot ; If these animals have a language it is restricted to a very few sounds of a general emotional signification .
Articulate speech they have none and communication with one another is accomplished by vocal sounds to no greater extent than it is by dogs , with a growl , a whine , or a bark .
They are , however , capable to a surprising degree of acquiring an understanding of human speech . &amp; quot ; Furness was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society ( 1897 ) , a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society ( 1898 ) , and a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland ( 1902 ) . An 1894 article in &amp; quot ; The Oregonian &amp; quot ; described Furness as &amp; quot ; the most artistically tattooed man in the world . &amp; quot ; It reported that during a long trip to Japan , he had been heavily tattooed : &amp; quot ; &amp; # 91 ; A &amp; # 93 ; splendid representation of the Goddess of Love covers his chest , and the God of Thunder illuminates his back .
Snakes and birds by the dozen mark his arms and thighs .
A pagoda is designed on one shoulder and a fearful and wonderful collection of geometrical designs covers the other shoulder .
A Chinese boat is tattooed on one leg , and a dragon looks from the other . &amp; quot ; His expeditions were underwritten by his father – his late mother had been heiress to an iron-making fortune and his father was a successful author .
He never married , and lived at &amp; quot ; Lindenshade , &amp; quot ; his parents &amp; apos ; house in Wallingford .
He provided some of the illustrations for the book &amp; quot ; String Figures and How to Make Them &amp; quot ; ( 1906 ) , by his sister , ethnologist Caroline Furness Jayne .
Following the deaths of Caroline in 1909 and her husband Horace Jayne in 1913 , their teenage children – Kate Furness Jayne and Horace H .
F .
Jayne – lived with him at &amp; quot ; Lindenshade . &amp; quot ; During World War I , he served as a captain in the U . S .
Army Medical Corps and organized distribution of medical supplies .
He donated the land for the Helen Kate Furness Free Library in Wallingford , named for his mother .
He began collecting and editing his father &amp; apos ; s letters , but ill health forced him to abandon the project .
It was completed by his nephew Horace .

Squish ( piston engine ) Squish is an effect in internal combustion engines which creates sudden turbulence of the fuel / air mixture as the piston approaches top dead centre ( TDC ) . In an engine designed to use the squish effect , at top dead centre the piston crown comes very close , ( typically less than 1 mm ) , to the cylinder head .
The gases are suddenly &amp; quot ; squished &amp; quot ; out within the combustion chamber , creating turbulence which promotes thorough fuel / air mixing , a factor beneficial to efficient combustion .
Squish effect may be found in side-valve , OHV and OHC engines , including engines with a Heron cylinder head .
JianchangosaurusJianchangosaurus is a genus of therizinosaurian dinosaur that lived approximately 126 million years ago during the early part of the Cretaceous Period from the Yixian Formation in what is now China .
The nearly complete juvenile specimen was missing only the distal tail .
&amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; was a small , lightly built , bipedal , ground-dwelling herbivore , that could grow up to an estimated long and was high at the hips . The genus name &amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; , means &amp; quot ; Jianchang lizard &amp; quot ; , and is derived from &amp; quot ; Jianchang &amp; quot ; , the name of the county of Liaoning Province , China , where thespecimen was found , and the Greek word &amp; quot ; sauros &amp; quot ; ( σαυρος ) meaning &amp; quot ; lizard &amp; quot ; The specific name &amp; quot ; yixianensis &amp; quot ; , refers to the Yixian Formation where the specimen was found , and the Latin suffix &amp; quot ; -ensis &amp; quot ; meaning &amp; quot ; originating in &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; was described and named by Hanyong Pu , Yoshitsugu Kobayashi , Junchang Lu , Li Xu , Yanhua Wu , Huali Chang , Jiming Zhang , and Songhai Jia in 2013 and the type species is &amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus yixianensis &amp; quot ; . The holotype specimen of &amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; 41HIII-0308A is a nearly complete skeleton of a single juvenile individual , missing only the distal portion of the tail .
&amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; was estimated to have been 1 m ( 3 . 3 ft ) tall at the hips and approximately 2 m ( 6 . 6 ft ) long .
Five sacral vertebrae are present in this genus , a condition that is similar to that of other basal therizinosaurs .
The humerus measures in length and is 7 % shorter than the scapula .
The ulna measures in length and is 78 % of the humerus length - which approximates the ratio observed in the basal therizinosaur &amp; quot ; Falcarius utahensis &amp; quot ; ( 77 % ) .
The pubis is 20 % longer than the ischium , and it projects anteroventrally and does not exhibit the opisthopubic condition .
The tibia ( 316 mm ) is 1 . 5 times longer than the femur ( 206mm ) , which is the highest ratio known in therizinosaurs , an adaptation which has been strongly correlated with the development of cursorial habits in dinosaurs . The skull is in good preservation and is nearly complete , missing only the ventral lacrimal , the posterior jugal , the postorbital , the anterior edge of the quadrate , and the anterior surangular bones .
&amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; possesses 27 maxillary teeth and approximately 25 to 28 dentary teeth .
The researchers observed , however , that at front of the upper jaw the premaxilla is edentulous and they hypothesized that it was covered by a rhamphotheca .
This is also supported by the presence of a series of foramina along the buccal margin on the lateral surface of the premaxilla .
By comparison , in most modern birds , the rhamphotheca grows , and is shed , continuously and in some species its color varies depending on the season .
The front portion of the lower jaw is down-turned and in combination with the rhamphotheca on the upper jaw , functioned to pluck food .
The skull measures in length , and is 10 % longer than the femur , a condition not shared by &amp; quot ; Beipiaosaurus inexpectus &amp; quot ; .
Derived features present in the skull of this genus strongly suggest adaptations for herbivory . &amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; possesses 27 maxillary teeth and approximately 25 to 28 dentary teeth .
The crowns on its teeth diminish in size as they progress toward the posterior of the skull .
The teeth on the upper jaw , exhibit the conventional dental morphology - in which the surface of the tooth facing the outside of the mouth is convex .
The teeth on the lower jaw possess the reversed morphology , where the surface of the tooth facing the outside is concave .
Pu et al .
( 2013 ) noted that this dental morphology &amp; quot ; likely maximized the biting stress during occlusion to cut fibers of plant material , similar to ornithopods and ceratopsians &amp; quot ; . The impressions of a series of wide and unbranched feathers were discovered with the fossils .
Only the distal ends of the feather impressions are visible .
Based on their morphology the feathers are considered primitive and bear resemblance to those found along the neck of &amp; quot ; Beipiaosaurus &amp; quot ; , which were collected in the same formation .
The authors noted that the &amp; quot ; presence of elongated broad filamentous feathers ( EBFF ) suggests that they might have been used for visual display &amp; quot ; . The only known &amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; skeleton is that of a juvenile individual .
The morphological evidence supporting ontogenetic immaturity consists of the observation that the neurocentral sutures are open ( i . e .
not fused ) in all of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae , as well as in the cervical ribs and in the sacral centra .
The scapula and coracoid are also unfused , which the authors indicate may be an ontogenetic feature in &amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; also suggesting that is a juvenile .
This condition , however , is also observed in adult basal therizinosaurs . Like the dinosaurs &amp; quot ; Falcarius utahensis &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Beipiaosaurus inexpectus &amp; quot ; , &amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; was classified as a basal therizinosaur .
Phylogenetic analysis suggests that it is more derived than &amp; quot ; Falcarius &amp; quot ; but more primitive than &amp; quot ; Beipiaosaurus &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus yixianensis &amp; quot ; is the only known therizinosaur that possesses a tail with caudal centra that are oval in shape .
The following is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Pu et al .
in 2013 , showing the relationships of &amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; : A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism ( or group ) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms .
Some , but not all , of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies .
An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group . According to Pu et al .
( 2013 ) , &amp; quot ; Jianchangosaurus &amp; quot ; can be distinguished based on the following characteristics :

Lionello StockLionello Stock ( 1866 – 1948 ) was a Croatian-Italian industrialist , businessman and owner of the Camis &amp; amp ; Stock company ( now Fernet Stock ) . Born in Split on 16 December 1866 to Abramo and Gentile ( née Valenzin ) , Stock was raised with his brother Emil Stock and 10 siblings .
Stock &amp; apos ; s paternal Ashkenazi Jewish family originated from Frankfurt am Main , German Empire , while his maternal Sephardi Jewish family arrived in Split during Napoleonic era .
His father moved to Split in 1844 from Trieste ( then in the Austrian Empire ) . In 1884 Stock and his partner Carlo Camis founded the steam wine distillery &amp; quot ; Distilleria a vapore Camis &amp; amp ; Stock &amp; quot ; .
His company &amp; apos ; s main product was cognac &amp; quot ; Medicinal &amp; quot ; , which competed with French alternatives in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and German Empire territory .
By the 1920s the Stock company was one of the largest companies of its kind in Europe .
In 1920 , after Austro-Hungarian monarchy collapsed , Stock bought a distillery factory at Plzeň Božkov ( in the then Czechoslovakia ) .
Stock eventually came to own a network of distilleries , bottling plants and ageing facilities in Italy , Austria , Poland , Hungary and Croatia .
He also expanded business and established an outpost in New York City , United States . In 1939 , following the Nazi annexation , the Stock factory in Plzeň - being a Jewish business - was seized by Nazi Germany &amp; apos ; s occupation force .
In later stages of World War II , Stock himself - already an old man - was persecuted along with other Jews in Trieste , but managed to survive .
After Czechoslovakia &amp; apos ; s liberation in 1945 , the Plzeň factory was momentarily returned to Stock and his family - but was nationalized in 1947 by the Czechoslovak Communist regime . Stock died at Trieste in 1948 .

Eight Days , Assassination Attempts against King JeongjoEight Days , Assassination Attempts against King Jeongjo ( ) is a South Korean television miniseries starring Kim Sang-joong , Park Jung-chul , Jung Ae-ri , Lee Seon-ho , and Hee Won .
The series ran for 10 episodes , and was aired by CGV from November 17 , 2007 to December 16 , 2007 .
This show is placed in the context of the Eight Days procession organized in 1795 by King Jeongjo of Joseon to visit the tomb of his father at Hwaseong Fortress .
This historic event was a huge one , involving 5,661 people and 1,417 horses . The screenplay is based on the novel &amp; quot ; Journey &amp; quot ; ( ; lit .
&amp; quot ; a round trip &amp; quot ; ) written in 2006 by Oh Se-yeong .
The background of the action is the 1795 procession organized by King Jeongjo of Joseon for the 60th birthday of his mother , Lady Hyegyeong that also commemorated the 60th birthday of his deceased father , the Crown Prince Sado .
During the eight days period when the Court left the palace for the ceremony , the show introduces several assassination attempts against the King .
A first one comes from the Moon In-bang &amp; apos ; s group ( a millenarist sect ) .
But this plot is used by the Noron Faction to pursue its own agenda , attempting an armed suppression against the Sipa Faction and the King as well . Apart from the fictional elements , a major focus is placed on two historical sources .
The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong is extensively used during many flashback sequences relative to events that occurred before the death ( 1762 ) of Crown Prince Sado , while the official documents from the Joseon Royal Library are used for the current events : the &amp; quot ; Wonhaeng Eulmyo Jeongni Uigwe &amp; quot ; ( Eulmyo = 1795 ) for the Procession itself , and the &amp; quot ; Hwaseong Seongyeokuigwe &amp; quot ; concerning the Hwaseong Fortress as a whole . This series is often referred as &amp; quot ; Eight Days , Mystery of Jeong Jo Assassination &amp; quot ; , a misleading translation since King Jeongjo won the 1795 confrontation and only died in 1800 . As described in the credits of the last episode , the drama involves the following characters : The main document of the 1795 procession is an eight-panel screen , the Hwaseonghaenghaengdo Byeongpun .
Nowadays , three copies of this screen exists : a sepia one , a blue one and a colored one , the King &amp; apos ; s copy .
This last copy can be seen at Samsung Museum of Art Leeum and has been designated as Korean National Treasure 1430 in 2005-04-15 . Map of the Hwaseong Fortress in the 1800 Uigwe .
Bert ReeseBert Reese ( 1851 – 1926 ) was an American-Polish medium and mentalist , most well known for his billet reading demonstrations . Reese was born Berthold Riess in Posen .
He was a spiritualist and friend of Aleister Crowley .
He claimed to possess the ability of x-ray vision .
He drew criticism from magicians of the period who could replicate his billet reading feats by trick methods . Reese was an expert billet reader .
In 1915 , Reese was convicted by a magistrate as a fortune teller .
He appealed his conviction and agreed to demonstrate his abilities by taking a test .
At the court hearing in New York , Judge Rosalsky wrote three questions on a slip of paper .
Reese successfully told the judge what the questions were .
The charge was dropped and he was released . The famous inventor Thomas Edison was duped by the billet reading tricks of Reese and stated he was &amp; quot ; neither a medium nor a fake &amp; quot ; . Psychical researcher Eric Dingwall who observed Reese in New York City claimed to have discovered his cheating methods .
According to Dingwall the exploits of Reese were &amp; quot ; not worth any serious scientific consideration &amp; quot ; and he came into contact with the sealed notes .
Walter Franklin Prince also observed Reese &amp; apos ; s method of sleight of hand . The controversy surrounding Reese led &amp; quot ; The New York Times &amp; quot ; journalist Edward Marshall to write two articles in November , 1910 with illustrations and suggested methods how Reese performed his tricks .
His tricks were also exposed by magician Samri Frikell who replicated his feats . In 1920 , in a letter to Arthur Conan Doyle , magician Harry Houdini wrote that during a séance he had observed Reese &amp; apos ; s tricks .
Houdini noted that Reese had managed to deceive Edison , Judge Rosalsky and many others who were unexperienced in magic trickery .
He commented that &amp; quot ; Reese knew who I was , when I called for a sitting , and I will say that , of all the clever sleight-of-hand men he is the brainiest I have ever come across &amp; quot ; . Magic historians consider Reese to have been an expert mentalist . In 1938 , magic historian John Mulholland noted that &amp; quot ; Reese was extraordinarily clever in misleading and confusing his subjects regarding what really happened . . .
he was an extraordinary sleight-of-hand performer ; certainly nothing more . ” In 1950 , magician Joseph Rinn revealed the billet reading tricks of Reese . Science writer Martin Gardner wrote that Reese was an expert mentalist no different from stage magicians of the period such as Joseph Dunninger but managed to fool a number of people into believing he was a genuine psychic .
The most detailed account at exposing his tricks ( with diagrams ) was by mentalist Theodore Annemann .
Jean Cocteau MuseumThe Jean Cocteau Museum / Séverin Wunderman Collection is a museum in Menton , on the French Riviera , in the Alpes-Maritimes department .
Dedicated to the French artist Jean Cocteau , it incorporates the collection of American businessman and Cocteau enthusiast Séverin Wunderman . The decision to create the museum was made by the Menton city council in December 2003 .
An international competition was held by the council in 2007 , with a winner for the design of the museum announced in June 2008 .
The foundation stone was laid in December 2008 , with the shell completed in January 2011 .
The competition to design the museum building was won by French architect Rudy Ricciotti , an exponent of &amp; apos ; hedonist architecture &amp; apos ; in the 1980s .
Ricciotti had previously designed the new Islamic art wing at the Louvre , among other cultural commissions .
Ricciotti &amp; apos ; s design was directly inspired by Cocteau &amp; apos ; s life and work , he has said of the museum &amp; apos ; s design that &amp; quot ; Black and white no longer serve as colours here . . . they create an interplay of structural forces calling to mind both the artist ’ s works on paper and the poet ’ s personality , his zones of light and darkness , his enigmatic self-mythology fueled by contrasts . &amp; quot ; The distinctive facade of the building has been variously described as &amp; quot ; . . . like a fierce set of teeth or a string of alabaster forearms holding up the sky &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; . . . like a spider , with jagged black pillars sprawling leg-like over the building &amp; quot ; . Among the financial backers of the museum was Pierre Bergé , partner of the late Yves Saint Laurent .
The museum took eight years to create , and is 29,000 sq ft in size . Divided into seven parts , the museum contains almost 1000 graphic works by Cocteau , with the majority of the collection from collector Severin Wunderman .
Wunderman was 19 when he began collecting works by Cocteau .
He had offered his collection to the University of Texas , but later withdrew the offer , keeping his collection in his own Cocteau museum in Irvine , California , which he dedicated in 1985 .
He would frequently lend pieces to exhibitions and shows .
The scope of the collection spans early avant-garde graphic works with pencil , pastel , and watercolours on paper , to his films , with extensive clips from his &amp; quot ; Orphic Trilogy &amp; quot ; .
As well as Cocteau &amp; apos ; s work , the museum contains a collection of 240 original photographic prints by Lucien Clergue relating to the work of Cocteau , mostly taken during the filming of Testament of Orpheus .
The work Cocteau left upon his death in 1963 was catalogued by Annie Guédras , who identified at least three dozen fakes and copies among the pieces , some of which were destined for Wunderman &amp; apos ; s donation to the museum .
The museum did eventually withdraw the works in question .
Guédras later felt that she was excluded from the Cocteau Committee that created the museum in the early 2000s because of her discovery . A documentation centre for Cocteau &amp; apos ; s work is based at the museum , which contains books , magazines , journals , catalogues , and monographs on Cocteau .
An Office of Graphic Art at the museum conserves the collection when not on display .
The museum also features a cafe , shop , and spaces to hire . From 1950 onwards , Jean Cocteau was a frequent guest at Francine Weisweiller &amp; apos ; s villa &amp; quot ; Santo Sospir &amp; quot ; in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat on the French Riviera .
In 1955 , he was invited to attend the Classical Music Festival in nearby Menton .
Delighted by the experience , he developed an attachment to the town and befriended the mayor , who suggested he decorate the town &amp; apos ; s wedding hall .
In recognition of this work , which Cocteau accomplished in 1957 and 1958 , Menton declared him an honorary citizen .
The Cocteau hall remains to this day a popular venue for weddings in the town . In September 1957 , the mayor of Menton also offered Cocteau to create a museum in the Bastion , a then disused 17th century fort situated near the harbor .
Enthusiastic about the project , the artist worked on rearranging and decorating the building in his last years , as well as selecting the pieces he wanted exhibited there .
The Bastion museum opened to the public in 1966 , three years after Cocteau &amp; apos ; s death .
List of Royal Navy vice admiralsVice admiral is a flag officer rank of the British Royal Navy and equates to the NATO rank code OF-8 .
It is immediately superior to the rear admiral rank and is subordinate to the full admiral rank . The Royal Navy has had vice admirals since at least the 16th century .
When the fleet was deployed , the vice admiral would be in the leading portion or van , acting as the deputy to the admiral .
2013 Austin Peay Governors football teamThe 2013 Austin Peay Governors football team represented Austin Peay State University during the 2013 NCAA Division I FCS football season .
The Governors were led by first-year head coach Kirby Cannon , played their home games at Governors Stadium , and were a member of the Ohio Valley Conference .
They finished the season 0 – 12 , 0 – 8 in OVC play to finish in last place .
Brantford 99ersThe Brantford 99ers are a Canadian junior ice hockey team based in Brantford , Ontario , Canada .
They play in the Mid-Western Conference of the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League . For years , the Brantford Eagles franchise were not very successful .
From 1992 until 2002 , the Eagles were only able to surpass ten wins once .
Most of that time , the team had been transplanted to Ohsweken , Ontario .
In 2002 , the team moved back to Brantford and began winning more consistently .
By the 2005-06 season , the Eagles made the Mid-Western League final .
In 2007 , the three Ontario Hockey Association Junior B Leagues merged into the GOJHL .
From that point on , the Eagles would win three Mid-Western regular season championships , three Mid-Western Conference playoff championships , and the 2009 Sutherland Cup as Ontario Champions .
But the fans did not come .
On May 23 , 2012 , the Eagles were official moved to Caledonia , Ontario and became the Caledonia Corvairs . In 2012 , the GOJHL announced it was recruiting new teams for a new Toronto-based fourth conference for the league .
In Spring 2013 , the plan would unceremoniously die , but a Brantford group that had decided to apply for entry transferred their request to the Mid-Western Conference .
Their request was accepted and the ownership group named themselves the 99 &amp; apos ; ers in honour of Wayne Gretzky and the Brantford Minor Hockey Association . On September 6 , 2013 , the 99ers played their first ever game , on the road , against the Brampton Bombers .
Luc Hartholt scored the first goal in franchise history at 2 : 29 of the first period in a 4-3 win .
Andre Keire made 20 saves to pick up the first ever win in net .
Honolulu Museum of Art SchoolThe Honolulu Museum of Art School , formerly known as Linekona School , is an historic school building in Honolulu , Hawaii , that now serves as a center for arts education for the Honolulu Museum of Art . The eclectic architecture of the building combines two principal styles .
Colonial Revival styles were very popular for both residential and public buildings when the school was built in 1908 .
The building &amp; apos ; s symmetry , proportions , large columned portico , and balustraded roofline are typical of the style .
At the same time , the round arches on the upper-story windows and the stone block facade are typical of the Romanesque Revival style that was often employed for substantial public buildings in that period .
However , the imitation stone facade is actually formed from carefully rendered concrete blocks — the best example of such craftsmanship in Hawaii . As an educational institution , the school &amp; apos ; s legacy traces back to Oahu Charity School in 1831 , which was for a few years the only English-language school in Hawaii , and one of only six west of the Rockies .
Weakened by competition from other private schools founded in the 1840s , it began to receive public funds in 1851 and changed its name to Town Free School , but only came under control of the public superintendent of schools in 1859 .
In 1865 , the public board of education separated boys and girls , renaming Town Free School into Mililani School for Girls while sending most of the boys to Royal School .
However , a few of the boys transferred to the new , privately run Fort Street English Day School , which became public in 1873 , and became Honolulu High School in 1895 , while the lower grades formed the new Kaiulani Elementary School .
Classes met in the former palace of Princess Ruth Keelikolani on Queen Emma Street , where Central Intermediate School now stands . In 1907 , Honolulu High School was renamed President William McKinley High School and moved into the new school building completed in 1908 on the former Maertens property facing Thomas Square .
After McKinley High moved into a new , larger campus on S .
King Street in 1923 , its former site became Linekona ( or Lincoln ) Elementary School . In its current function , the Honolulu Museum of Art School ( formerly the Academy Art Center at Linekona ) offers studio art classes and workshops , and hosts exhibitions showcasing the island ’ s folk and contemporary artists .
The school offers arts education programs for children with special needs and public school students and maintains a lending collection for educators , students , and community groups .

Valery RozovValery Rozov ( December 26 , 1964 – November 11 , 2017 ) was a Russian BASE jumper , who became known for jumping from the world &amp; apos ; s highest summits .
On May 5 , 2013 .
he jumped off Changtse ( the northern peak of the Mount Everest massif ) from a height of 7,220 metres ( 23,690 ft ) .
Using a specially-developed Red Bull wing suit , he glided down to the Rongbuk glacier more than 1,000 meters below , setting a new world record for highest base jump . Rozov died on November 11th 2017 while jumping from a height of 6,812 meters ( 22,349 ft ) off Ama Dablam mountain in Nepal .
According to members of his group , Rozov crashed into the side of the mountain .
He was 52 years old .
Astrocaryum standleyanumAstrocaryum standleyanum is a species of palm known by many common names , including chumba wumba , black palm , chonta , chontadura , coquillo , palma negra , pejibaye de montaña , güerre , güérregue , güinul , mocora , pucaishchi ( Chachi ) , and chunga ( Emberá ) .
It is native to Central and South America , where its distribution extends from Nicaragua to Ecuador .
It is most common in central Panama , even becoming &amp; quot ; abundant &amp; quot ; in the tropical forests around the Panama Canal , but in general it is not a common plant . This palm grows to up 15 to 20 meters tall .
The trunk diameter is up to 18 to 25 centimeters .
It is covered densely in sharp , flattened black spines up to 20 centimeters long .
The leaf stalks and leaf edges and the peduncles bearing the fruit clusters have smaller spines .
One plant is topped with about 15 mature leaves at a time .
The pinnate frond is up to 4 meters long and typically palm-like in appearance .
It has many leaflets arranged irregularly , clustered and angled .
The underside is glaucous .
A mature , expanded leaf lasts for about 4 . 5 years , and the plant grows 3 to 5 new leaves per year .
The trunk is patterned with the marks of leaves that have fallen away .
The spines are distributed between these leaf scars on the trunk .
The plant becomes reproductively mature at 9 to 10 years of age .
Flowering occurs during the rainy season .
The inflorescence of tiny white flowers grows upright , then bends and hangs as the fruits develop .
The fruiting season is in March through June , during which time a mature plant produces about 6 clusters of fruit .
The cluster is a hanging spadix , which contains about 500 fruits in optimal conditions .
In leaner times a spadix might have only 100 or so .
The fruit is made up of a seed up to 3 centimeters wide coated in pulpy , orange flesh .
One fruit weighs about 25 grams . The fruit is attractive to many species of animals , such as agoutis , squirrels , spiny rats , capuchins , opossums , pacas , coatis , peccaries , and tapeti rabbits .
Some animals can navigate the spines or reach the fruit by jumping from other trees , as the capuchin does , but most take the fallen fruits on the ground .
The fruits were likely food for large mammals such as gomphotheres thousands of years ago .
Animals disperse the seeds .
The Central American agouti ( &amp; quot ; Dasyprocta punctata &amp; quot ; ) plays an important role in the life cycle of the plant .
It is one of the most important food sources for this species of agouti .
It collects the fruits and caches the seeds , burying them in the soil .
It is constantly interested in its caches and often digs up the seeds to rebury them elsewhere .
One agouti will commonly rob the cache of another , transporting the seeds to new locations .
Researchers tracking cached seeds saw one seed moved 36 times before being eaten .
The behavior is known as scatter-hoarding .
This helps distribute the palm throughout the forest .
As the fruiting season of the plant is about four months per year , the agouti makes up a large part of its diet with cached seeds the rest of the year .
The Central American spiny rat ( &amp; quot ; Proechimys semispinosus &amp; quot ; ) is known to scatter-hoard the seeds , as well . Other animals , such as ants , are not helpful , as they destroy the seeds while consuming the fruit .
Most fruits are infested by bruchid beetles , but scolytid beetles are more effective seed predators on the plant . This plant &amp; apos ; s common habitat type is wet forest up to 500 meters in elevation . The fruit is edible for humans , as are the palm hearts .
Other human uses for the plant include wood for walking sticks , bows , and fishing rods .
The fruits are fed to pigs .
It is occasionally processed for oil .
It is a very important fiber plant for many local peoples .
The Wounaa and Emberá peoples and native groups of African ancestry , such as Afro-Colombians and Afro-Ecuadorians , are familiar with the plant .
The fibers come from the leaves .
They are used to make furniture , pitchers , plates , trays , coasters , vases , bags , hats , jewelry and accessories , hammocks , and fishing nets .
Fibers from the opened leaves are used to make mats , while less robust fibers from the immature leaves are used for basketry . Much of the time , the fiber is harvested by cutting the fronds from the trees .
Sometimes , though , the trees are cut down , a more destructive practice .
This species is widespread in its range , but in localized areas where it is in demand for fiber , it has been &amp; quot ; decimated &amp; quot ; .
Its conservation status in most areas is unknown .
In parts of Ecuador it is maintained with tropical agroforestry practices .
Some local people grow plots of the palm on their land next to their crops . The harvest of the usable parts is often done with a machete , the harvester taking care to avoid the spines .
Instead of cutting down a tree , a harvester may use a &amp; quot ; media luna &amp; quot ; , a long pole with a curved blade at the end , to remove leaves .
A bamboo pole with a chisel at the end may also be used .
The Emberá prefer to harvest the plant during the full moon , when they believe the fibers are strongest .
The leaf is split and two types of fibers can be extracted , a thick one useful for making the frames of baskets , and a thinner one used for weaving .
The fibers are washed and sun-dried , then sometimes dyed with extracts of other plants , bleached with sulphur , or buried in mud to darken them .
In basketry the fibers may be woven together with fibers from the Nahuala palm ( &amp; quot ; Carludovica palmata &amp; quot ; ) , a palm-like monocot . Except in Ecuador , few of the products are used at home .
Most are sold locally or at nearby bazaars or shipped internationally .
There is a massive world market for handcrafted plant-fiber products , with Japan and the United States major importers .
This is considered to be one of the most economically important palms in Ecuador .
Charles Marcus EdwardsCharles Marcus Edwards is a deacon at a church in Meadville , Mississippi and a self-declared Klansmen .
In 1964 , Edwards , along with James Ford Seale , faced state murder charges for the deaths of two black men , Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee , but charges were dropped due to the close cooperation of law enforcement with the Ku Klux Klan .
There were rumors circulating amongst members of the KKK that black Muslims were preparing for &amp; quot ; insurrection &amp; quot ; by bringing guns into Franklin County .
Klan members , including Seale , picked up Moore and Dee while they were hitchiking near Meadville , and beat them with beanpoles until they were unconscious , repeatedly asking the pair to identify who was behind the county &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Negro trouble &amp; quot ; .
Moore and Dee were unconscious but still breathing when the Klansmen dumped their bodies in the Mississippi River .
Edwards later confessed to the FBI that he and Seale had kidnapped and beaten two young black men .
In the 2007 documentary &amp; quot ; Mississippi Cold Case , &amp; quot ; Thomas Moore , the brother of the murdered Charles Moore , seeks justice for the unpunished killing of Charles and Henry .
Thomas confronted Edwards in Meadville , Mississippi , but at first Edwards didn &amp; apos ; t want to discuss the murder case .
All Edwards said was &amp; quot ; I ain &amp; apos ; t guilty of that . &amp; quot ; Edwards confessed during FBI questioning , but he was given immunity in exchange for this testimony against James Ford Seale .
In his testimony , Edwards said he aimed a shotgun at the victims while Klan members beat them , that he saw the victims stuffed alive into a trunk and driven away , and that Seale later reported he and others drowned the two men in a bayou of the Mississippi river .
Henry Folliott Scott-StokesHenry Folliott Scott-Stokes ( 13 October 1896 - 19 January 1976 ) was an English businessman and writer . Scott-Stokes was educated at Winchester College and New College , Oxford , where he came to know the economist Roy Harrod .

Waidele Wolff was appointed Mayor of Pichilemu , by the military government presided by General Augusto Pinochet , in 1981 .
He succeeded José Lino Vargas Jorquera , who held the office between 1979 and 1981 .
He held office until 1982 . During his administration , he made an attempt to buy the building that now hosts the Agustín Ross Cultural Center with municipal funds ; however , Waidele was not allowed to complete the purchase because the price of eight million pesos ( approximately US $ 16,000 ) was &amp; quot ; too high for the municipal budget , and would leave many things without financing . &amp; quot ;
Barber-Colman knotterA Barber-Colman knotter is a piece of textile machinery used in a weaving shed .
When all the warp carried on the weavers beam has been used , a new beam replaces it .
Each end has to pass through the eyes on the existing heddles , and through the existing reed .
The knotter takes each new thread and knots it the existing end , which will pull it through the correct healds and reed , saving much time .
.
A good man could do 32 or 33 warps a day . FootnotesCitationsBibliography

Barnwell R .
LeggeBarnwell Rhett Legge ( July 9 , 1891 – June 7 , 1949 ) was a highly decorated U . S .
Army officer , who reached the rank of Brigadier General .
He is most noted as a Military Attaché to Switzerland during World War II . Legge was born in Charleston , South Carolina to Claude Lascelles Legge and Elizabeth Judd Hutchinson Legge .
He attended The Citadel and graduated in 1911 . Legge studied law at the University of South Carolina .
After the US entered World War I , he was appointed the regimental adjutant of the 26th Infantry Regiment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt , Jr .
( the eldest son of President Theodore Roosevelt ) .
Roosevelt Jr .
later wrote in his book &amp; quot ; Average Americans &amp; quot ; : &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; All during my service in Europe , Legge served with me .
During the latter part he was my second in command in the regiment .
I have seen him under all circumstances .
He was always cool and decided .
No mission was too difficult for him to undertake .
His ability as a troop leader was of the highest order .
In my opinion no man of his age has a better war record . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Legge participated with the 26th Infantry in the Battle of Soissons , where half of the men of 26th Infantry Regiment were killed in combat .
For conspicuous gallantry in action Legge was awarded 4 Silver Stars . Major Legge subsequently participated in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and personally led an attack against a strong enemy position .
Legge inspired his men by his courage , cutting his way through entanglements and directing the attacks against three different strong points .
For this actions , he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism in combat . For his military service during World War I , Legge was also awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership of 26th Infantry regiment and with the Legion of Honour and French &amp; quot ; Croix de guerre 1914-1918 &amp; quot ; with Palm by the French government . After the War , Legge served at various infantry positions , including the capacity of instructor at Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas from 1936 to 1939 . He subsequently served for a short period as an Assistant Military Attaché to France and then was the Military Attaché to Switzerland at the US Legation in Bern .
He stayed in Switzerland for the whole period of World War II and in this capacity , he helped arrange the escape of many interned US fliers .
For service in this capacity , Legge was awarded with the Legion of Merit by the US Government .
He also received Order of the British Empire in the grade of Commander by the United Kingdom . Respected historian Donald Miller regards Legge as an altogether more controversial figure than his post-war accolades would suggest .
He is severely critical of Legge &amp; apos ; s role in Switzerland : &amp; quot ; The country ’ s military police actively hunted down American fliers making for the border , shooting and wounding a number of them .
Most of those who were apprehended were sentenced to indeterminate prison terms , with the compliance of General Legge , who was unofficially in charge of American military internees .
Using the threat of court-martial , Legge warned American airmen not to escape .
Escape attempts would alienate their hosts , Legge told Spaatz ’ s headquarters in England , and slow down the negotiations he was secretly conducting for the airmen ’ s release .
But Legge was more concerned with appeasing the Swiss than with freeing the American internees , and when fellow Americans were caught escaping and imprisoned by the Swiss , he monitored their deplorable prison conditions with inexcusable indifference .
In the last two years of the war , the “ benevolent hosts ” of the American airmen threw 187 of them into one of the most abhorrent prison compounds in Europe , a punishment camp run by a sadistic Nazi . &amp; quot ; However , another historian , Dwight Mears , profiled the fate of American airmen in Switzerland in his dissertation while teaching at West Point , and reached a starkly different conclusion .
Mears documented that Legge was , in reality , running the escape network to get U . S .
airmen out of Switzerland , and in no way condoned the imprisonment of these men for attempting escape .
Rather than appeasing the Swiss , Legge was actually under investigation by the Swiss government for assisting the Americans to flee from internment .
In fact , the Swiss Federal Council considered issuing a formal demarche against his activities , which they communicated to Legge directly .
Legge did not bow to this pressure , but rather appealed directly to senior Swiss officials in order to secure better treatment for the airmen .
He even threatened to leak word of their actions to the press to embarrass them , as he knew very well that allegations that the Swiss government was violating international law would taint the Swiss reputation for upholding humanitarian norms .
The threat was made good on in 1945 , when the Army &amp; apos ; s publication Yank : The Army Weekly profiled the actions of the Swiss government , ostensibly drawing from U . S .
Legation files that virtually quoted Legge &amp; apos ; s description of punishment camp conditions .
Mears concluded that the negative impressions of Legge were forged by the lack of communication between the Legation and the internees , which was a direct consequence of Swiss interference after internment officials discovered that Legation visits to interned airmen quickly resulted in successful escapes .
As a result , such visits were prohibited , and internees had little personal contact with the attaché or his staff .
The airmen were almost entirely cut off from reliable information , and often jumped to conclusions that were based solely on rumors or assumptions .
In fact , after making good on their escapes , a number of airmen protested to the War Department about perceived negligence by the Legation staff .
In late 1944 , the War Department officially investigated whether Legge had threatened to court martial airmen for unauthorized escape attempts , but it was clear that there was no formal evidence that such a threat had ever been issued .
Rather , this was likely a misunderstanding of Legge &amp; apos ; s instruction not to escape without assistance from the Legation , which was an unsuccessful attempt to improve their chances of success .
Brigadier General Barnwell R .
Legge retired in 1948 due to poor health and died on June 7 , 1949 in Washington , D . C .
at the age of 57 .
He was buried together with his wife Phyllis B .
Legge at Arlington National Cemetery . Here is Brigadier general Legge ´ s ribbon bar :

Bo01Bo01 ( also known as the &amp; quot ; City of Tomorrow &amp; quot ; ) was a housing expo in the southern Swedish city of Malmö .
It was created as part of the European Housing Expo in 2001 and is notable for its sustainable character .
The most notable building built for Bo01 was the Turning Torso skyscraper , which became the tallest building in Scandinavia .
It was however not completed in time , and was not ready until 2005 . The Western Harbour in Malmö had long been the host for the Kockums shipbuilding industry .
However following the decline of the company the area was left largely abandoned .
A SAAB factory was founded in the 1990s , however this was soon closed down .
An expo on Ön in Malmö was planned for 2000 , however following the council &amp; apos ; s acquisition of the Western Harbour it was decided that this former industrial area would be a more suitable location .
Therefore the expo was moved to the Western Harbour and delayed by a year . Bo01s strong environmental profile is evident in many of the districts features .
Solar cells and solar thermal collectors are present on many of the buildings , other renewable electricity is provided by the districts own wind turbine Boel situated in Norra Hamnen .
The original plan envisioned a system of &amp; apos ; 100 per cent renewable energy &amp; apos ; , however energy consumption proved to be higher than estimated .
Heating and cooling is provided through district heating and waste is disposed of in a number of ways – some houses are fitted with food waste grinders in sinks , others are supplied with paper bags which are dispensed into a vacuum waste disposal unit . Head architect Klas Tham envisioned a network of street with a broken-up character , much like that of the inner-city of medieval towns .
This was to have a dual purpose , partly it would break up the urban environment allowing for a more pleasant experience , partly it was to break up the harsh sea winds . Persson , B . , 2013 .

MebicarMebicar ( mebicarum ) is an anxiolytic medication produced by Latvian pharmaceutical company Olainfarm and sold in Latvia and Russia under the brand name Adaptol .
Mebicar is not approved for use in the United States . Mebicar has an effect on the structure of limbic-reticular activity , particularly on hypothalamus emotional zone , as well as on all 4 basic neuromediator systems – γ aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , choline , serotonin and adrenergic activity .
Mebicar decreases the brain noradrenaline level , exerts no effect on the dopaminergic systems , increases the brain serotonin level , and does not elicit cholinolytic action . Mebicar purportedly has anti-anxiety ( anxiolytic ) properties . It is also used to aid smoking cessation .
In addition , mebicar may be useful in the treatment of ADHD symptoms .
In contrast with typical anxiolytic medications such as benzodiazepines , mebicar is non-habit forming , non-sedating and does not impair motor function .

Accumulator ( cryptography ) A cryptographic accumulator is a one way membership function .
It answers a query as to whether a potential candidate is a member of a set without revealing the individual members of the set .
One example is how large composite numbers accumulate their prime factors , as it &amp; apos ; s currently impractical to factor a composite number , but relatively easy to divide a specific prime into another number to see if it is one of the factors and / or to factor it out .
New members may be added or subtracted to the set of factors simply by multiplying or factoring out the number respectively .
More practical accumulators use a quasi-commutative hash function where the size ( number of bits ) of the accumulator does not grow with the number of members . The concept was introduced by J .
Benaloh and M .
de Mare in 1993The concept has received renewed interest recently due to the proposed Zerocoin add on to bitcoin , which employs cryptographic accumulators to eliminate trackable linkage in the bitcoin blockchain , which would make bitcoin anonymous and untraceable , increasing privacy of transactions .

Bo-MobileThe company , which was established in Bonn , Germany in 1998 and is also based there , has been known as Bo-Mobile GmbH since 2005 .
It manages different web comparison portals providing independent consumer advice with the aim of creating better market transparency .
In general the sector of price comparison tools has been challenged e . g .
by a European Union working group report questioning the independence of such websites , while general benefits have been confirmed in the same report . The history of the company begins in 1998 with the founding of the consumer portal handytarife . de .
In the following years , Bo-Mobile GmbH expanded its offer and grew to include five additional web portals . All six websites compare prices and features of products and services with direct links to the original providers . 1998 sees the launch of handytarife . de , an independent consumer portal focusing on mobile communication .
It enables comparisons of rates in various areas , for example prepaid or international calls .
A rate calculator has been available to users since 2004 and searches for suitable rates out of a total of almost 2,000 rates and options at present .
The mobile rate app introduced in 2013 records usage behaviour automatically and generates individual rate recommendations .
Regular mobile test reports and test videos on current mobile phone devices from all manufacturers are referenced by newspapers and specialist magazines . Based on the handytarife . de model and with the same scope , the sister site online-tarife . de has focussed on internet surfing rates since autumn 2007 .
All options from ISDN , DSL , Cable Internet access and UMTS through to LTE are compared .
In addition , tablet computers are tested by in-house experts and the results are showcased in test reports and videos . The launch of smavel . com in 2007 offers general travel information .
One of its main concerns is to present specialist travel providers , illuminating their main expertise and users are able to post ratings about those providers .
While these assessments provide interesting reference points it can be observed that users tend to share negative experiences , so that the overall picture on the providers ’ quality remains somewhat flawed . The Bo-Mobile GmbH service range was expanded through energietarife . com in 2008 .
This portal is also equipped with a comparison tool that is intended to provide information about energy prices , power suppliers , various energy sources and alternative , ecological energy .
In keeping with the new mobility trend , electric cars and bikes are also listed and compared in respective databases , and some of them form the subject of independent test reports . Bo-Mobile GmbH acquires the domain finanzcheck . com in 2009 and transforms it into a portal on topics such as finance , insurance , investments , accounts and loans . The website vergleichen . de was launched in late 2010 uniting several topics of consumer interest under the same roof .
In addition the site also compares offers in service areas such as real estate , job portals and dating agencies . In fall of 2014 Bo-Mobile launched forgetty , an online schedule book and appointment reminder especially created for groups of people that meet rather irregularly for their collaborative activities .
This service is also available in English . At the beginning of 2015 the finanzcheck . com domain was sold .
Its entire content however is now available on the newly launched Bo-Mobile website einfachefinanzen . de .
The site &amp; apos ; s name can be translated into : &amp; quot ; simple financial ( management ) &amp; quot ; . Some parts of the information and services offered on vergleichen . de are now available in the languages English , French and Turkish .
They are intended to provide assistance to expats and migrants in particular who are beginning a new phase of their life in Germany and to point out necessary steps beyond the obligatory official processes .
However , these subsites also mark the start of Bo-Mobile GmbH ’ s planned further expansion , which aims to appeal to customers in additional international markets . Within the scope of the consumer portals referred to , Bo-Mobile GmbH also hands out recognised awards and quality seals based on tests :

27 May 2013 Baghdad bombingsOn 27 May 2013 , a series of coordinated attacks occurred in Baghdad , the capital of Iraq , killing 71 people and injuring more than 200 others . From a peak of 3,000 deaths per month in 2006 – 07 , violence in Iraq decreased steadily for several years before beginning to rise again in 2012 .
In December 2012 , Sunnis began to protest perceived mistreatment by the Shia-led government .
The protests had been largely peaceful , but insurgents , emboldened by the war in neighboring Syria , stepped up attacks in the initial months of 2013 .
The number of attacks rose sharply after the Iraqi army raided a protest camp in Hawija on 23 April 2013 .
Overall , 712 people were killed in April according to UN figures , making it the nation &amp; apos ; s deadliest month in five years . Post-Hawija targets have included both Sunni and Shia mosques , as well as security forces and tribal leaders .
According to Mahmoud al-Sumaidaie , the deputy head of Iraq &amp; apos ; s Sunni Endowment , at least 29 Sunni mosques were attacked between mid-April and mid-May , resulting in the deaths of at least 65 worshippers .
In contrast , only two Shiite places of worship were attacked during the same period , with a single person being killed .
During the whole of 2012 , a total of 10 Sunni mosques were attacked , signifying a recent increase in the sectarian nature of the insurgency . The Baghdad bombings occurred in the aftermath of Iraq &amp; apos ; s deadliest week in almost 5 years , as a series of deadly bombings and shootings across the country killed at least 449 people and left 732 others injured between 15 May and 21 May . Almost all of the bombings in the capital took place at marketplaces or in crowded shopping areas of Shi &amp; apos ; ite districts .
These included a car bomb in Sadr City &amp; apos ; s Habibiya neighborhood that started with a driver faking a car accident and then running away from the scene .
As onlookers gathered , the explosives were detonated , killing 13 people and injuring 35 others .
Blasts in Sabi al-Boor and Umm al-Maalif left 14 dead and 60 injured , while 6 were killed and 14 wounded in a blast on Sa &amp; apos ; adoon Street .
Bombings took place at two markets in Shaab and Jesr Diyala as well , where 10 were killed and 43 others injured .
Similar attacks occurred in Bayaa , Hurriya , Kadhimiya , Jadida , Baladiyat and Sadriya - a total of 21 civilians lost their lives , while 72 others were wounded .
Among the locations bombed was a Shia mosque in the Jadida district .
Seven other fatalities were reported from Baghdad in various shootings and smaller attacks . Although the majority of insurgent activity was focused on Baghdad , several attacks took place in the central and northern parts of the country as well .
A car bombing killed 3 and injured 9 others in Madain , just south of the capital , while shootings in Mosul killed a policeman and injured two others and a civilian .
Three blasts on a farm in Shirqat killed two Sahwa militiamen and wounded three others .
A police captain was critically injured after being shot outside his home in Iskandariya .
Roadside blasts in Fallujah injured two soldiers , two civilians , as well as a police officer .
Unidentified gunmen killed a teacher in Khalis , a Sahwa official in Kirkuk , and a government employee carrying his co-workers &amp; apos ; salaries in Hit .
A roadside bomb killed a police colonel in Qayara , while two other blasts in Abu Saida and Zab injured two civilians and a Sahwa member . Kareem Alewi , a member of the Iraqi Parliament representing the National Iraqi Alliance attributed the security deterioration to &amp; quot ; foreign agendas aimed at dividing Iraq &amp; quot ; and accused them of supporting al-Qaeda in Iraq and remnants of the former Baath Party .
Former Parliament Speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani warned of a return to all-out sectarian violence , saying that politicians must &amp; quot ; neglect the foreign plots and promote the national interests &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; The current stage is the most difficult in the history of establishing the Iraqi State &amp; quot ; , he added .
Mahdi Haji , a member of the Kurdistan Alliance , blamed the recent increase in attacks on &amp; quot ; some regional and neighboring countries &amp; quot ; .

Felix Ivo LeicherFelix Ivo Leicher ( May 18 or 19 , 1727 - February 20 , 1812 ) was a Czech-born Viennese painter of altarpieces and secular works , which was spread to a wide area throughout the Habsburg Empire and beyond . He was born in the Silesian town Bílovec , today on the wall to the right of the main entrance of the parish church is a plaque that hangs in his memory .
He was apprenticed to a weaver , and later studied cutlery at school .
But his break came in a local painter shop with Francis Andrew Schaffer , where he learned the basics of painting .
Painting excited him and it became his entire life .
From 1751 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna , and in 1754 in a competition he received the second prize for painting &amp; quot ; Anointing Saul the King &amp; quot ; ( today , this image is a preparatory sketch in the German National Museum in Nuremberg ) , which had secured the support of the future of this school . His teacher there was , Franz Anton Maulbertsch , with whom he worked throughout his life kept friendly relations , working together as the frescoes and paintings for a church in Mikulov .
In many places , Leicher painted altarpieces in churches with frescoes .
The influence of his teachers could be seen in his work , as is evident in the rich coloristic main altar painting in Bílovec .
In several cases , the works were long attributed to just Maulbertsch and only recently found their true authorship as Leicher &amp; apos ; s . There is now no doubt that many of his works are still hidden in anonymity in various churches and collections , sometimes surprisingly authorship is revealed even smaller genre paintings and numerous sketches and drawings bear the marks of his hands .
In the latter part of the 18th century he devoted himself also to creating smaller cabinet paintings with secular themes . His composition , the concept of shapes , light handling and other features paintings show a significant effect of the work Maulbertsch , whose work he admired .
His approach is quieter , the expression of the character rather lyrical , restrained , narrative tuned .
Unlike Maulbertsch , Leicher was not affected by the expressive manifestation of Paul Troger .
He was inspired apparently also by other Venetian painters of 18th century , particularly the compositions of Giambattista Pittoni , and also images of Peter Paul Rubens .
It is most evident on two paintings for the church altar of John the Baptist in Kroměříž .
Its development lacks obvious drama or a representative sample of altarpieces in Opava parish church of the Assumption , which are often seen as the most perfect , do not lose connection to the Rococo works of his early creative period . Some critics , however , see more inspiration coming from the works of Michelangelo Unterberger , a professor at the Vienna Academy , whose work was a kind of moderate variant of the former academic uniform style , especially for it suggests a simple , clear compositional solutions and more lyrical , moderate tone of works by both artists .

Vibing Up the Senile Man ( Part One ) Vibing Up the Senile Man ( Part One ) is the second studio album by English rock band Alternative TV , released in March 1979 by record label Deptford Fun City .
On this album , the band followed an even more experimental and avant-garde approach than on &amp; quot ; The Image Has Cracked &amp; quot ; ( 1978 ) . The album &amp; apos ; s tracks were all reportedly recorded in a single take . Regarding its musical style , Alternative TV frontman Mark Perry recalled : &amp; quot ; There are free jazz influences ; I &amp; apos ; d got into the Art Ensemble of Chicago , Sun Ra &amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; I &amp; apos ; d moved into this house with an amazing music room – pianos , clarinets , you name it – and we &amp; apos ; d always be picking up stuff from junk shops . &amp; quot ; According to Simon Reynolds in &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; , the album received a &amp; quot ; uniformly hostile &amp; quot ; response from reviewers upon its release .
&amp; quot ; Trouser Press &amp; quot ; described the record as being &amp; quot ; up the pseudo-avant creek without a paddle &amp; quot ; . in his retrospective review of the album , Dean McFarlane of AllMusic noted : &amp; quot ; On the second album of Alternative TV , Mark Perry and friends did to punk exactly what the movement had intended for the establishment .
About-facing punk and turning it on its ear would be a difficult task in 1980 , and while Alternative TV &amp; apos ; s peers headed down new wave paths or into commercialism &amp; # 91 ; . . . &amp; # 93 ; who would have expected a follow-up as avant-garde abstraction that challenges P . I . L &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Second Edition &amp; quot ; for absolute left-field swing ? With Genesis P-Orridge in the ranks , &amp; quot ; Vibing Up the Senile Man &amp; quot ; became closer to free improvisation and avant-garde jazz without a punk anthem in sight , and a dub edge to some of the tracks of the double LP suggest that Alternative TV had similar modernist aspirations to John Lydon &amp; apos ; s post-Sex Pistols project .
Captain Beefheart and Frank Zappa spring to mind as much as Pere Ubu and the Red Krayola , who were similarly exploring the avant-garde liberties of post-punk and disappointing the punks and record industry alike .
What &amp; quot ; Vibing Up the Senile Man &amp; quot ; represents two decades later is a door opening on multi-faceted post-rock music – which draws on avant-garde , noise and jazz and arguably makes more sense in the context of year 2000 as a musical treasure much more than in 1980 , when it seemed simply a spit in the eye to the industry that codified punk . &amp; quot ; Paul Hegarty , in &amp; quot ; Noise Music : A History &amp; quot ; , described the album as &amp; quot ; forming the bridge into industrial music &amp; quot ; . The record was placed at number 19 on &amp; quot ; Mojo &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; nowiki &amp; gt ; &amp; apos ; &amp; lt ; / nowiki &amp; gt ; s list of readers &amp; apos ; choice of 50 &amp; quot ; Weirdest Albums &amp; quot ; .

SalwarpeSalwarpe is a small village in the Wychavon district of Worcestershire , England , less than two miles south west of Droitwich , but in open country .
The name is also spelled Salwarp , and in the time of John Leland was recorded as Salop .
No longer a civil parish in its own right , Salwarpe now shares a parish council with Hindlip and Martin Hussingtree . A Saxon charter of the year 817 records that Coenwulf , King of Mercia , granted the manor of Salwarpe to Denebeorht , Bishop of Worcester , and his Priory .
By the 11th century , the grant had been alienated , and a nobleman named Godwine had possession of the principal manor of Salwarpe , while his brother Leofric , Earl of Mercia , was a lesser landowner there .
As Godwine was dying about 1052 , Saint Wulfstan , who was Dean of Worcester , persuaded him to give his manor of Salwarpe back to Worcester Priory , but Godwine &amp; apos ; s son Ethelwine ( named in the Domesday Book as being in possession in the time of King Edward ) repudiated his father &amp; apos ; s Will and kept it , denying the bequest to the Priory .
Salwarpe was in the ancient hundred of Clent . By 1086 , the Norman Urse d &amp; apos ; Abetot had acquired an estate in Worcestershire which became the Barony of Salwarpe , which included Salwarpe Court , a substantial country house , later a seat of the Earls of Warwick .
In 1381 , this house was the birthplace of Richard de Beauchamp , 13th Earl of Warwick .
It was rebuilt for a new owner , Sir John Talbot , in the time of Queen Elizabeth I .
In this era , the Domesday hundreds of Clent and Cresslow were combined to form Halfshire hundred . The ancient parish of Salwarpe contains several hamlets .
The early nineteenth-century enclosure map shows Boycott , Chauson , Copcott , High Park , Hill End , Ladywood , Middleton , Newland , and Oakley , and most of these names were also recorded in the 17th century . The Church of England parish church , dedicated to St Michael and All Angels , is unusually large for a village now so small , but it reflects greater importance in past centuries .
Parts of the church are Norman . In 1868 , the &amp; quot ; National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland &amp; quot ; saidThe River Salwarpe rises near Bromsgrove and passes Stoke Prior , Upton Warren , Wychbold , Salwarpe , and Droitwich , after which it meets the River Severn at Hawford .
The 18th century Droitwich Canal also passes near the village . The BBC &amp; apos ; s Droitwich Transmitting Station , established in 1934 , is a few miles north of the village .
DZIS-TVDZIS-TV , channel 48 , is a television station of Philippine television network GMA Network .
Its studio is located at Brgy .
Bayubay Sur , San Vicente , Ilocos Sur and the location of transmitter is at Mt .
Caniao , Bantay , Ilocos Sur .
Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas StateThe Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State ( FACTS ) is a 26-acre forensic anthropology research facility located on the Freeman Ranch in San Marcos , Texas .
It is one of the six extant body farms in the United States and the largest such forensics research facility in the world . A Forensic Anthropology Research Facility was commissioned by the Texas State University Department of Anthropology and is under the direction of Dr .
Michelle Hamilton , a former student of Dr .
Bill Bass .
The forensic research facility is fully operational and is part of the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State ( FACTS ) .
The forensic facility has received a financial donation of over $ 100,000 from a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Texas State University , and has started construction of an adjoining million dollar lab to augment the facility .
The development of this facility has been possible through the efforts of Dr .
Jerry Melbye , D-ABFA . Prior to the selection of the location , objections by local residents and the nearby San Marcos Municipal Airport ( owing to concerns about circling vultures ) stalled the plan .
But on February 12 , 2008 , Texas State University announced that its Freeman Ranch , off County Road 213 northwest of San Marcos , would be the site of the facility .
The vultures that originally created problems for the location of the research facility have provided a new area of study on the effect of vulture scavenging on human decomposition . The Forensic Anthropology Research Facility ( FARF ) is a human decomposition research laboratory where questions related to outdoor crime scenes and decomposition rates for human remains under various topographical and climate conditions are investigated .
The FARF serves as a resource for students of forensic anthropology as well as state and national law enforcement agencies .
The work conducted here will have a direct impact on law enforcement and forensic investigations throughout the state of Texas , and beyond .
The Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State accepts body donations for scientific research purposes under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act .
The areas of research conducted with donated bodies will include reconstructing the postmortem interval to determine time since death and related studies in human decomposition .
The overall aim of this type of research is to assist law enforcement agents and the medico-legal community in their investigations . While practical restraints currently limit the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility to only around seven acres in the Texas Hill Country , Freeman Ranch has about available .

&amp; apos ; S Make It &amp; apos ; S Make It ( slang for &amp; apos ; Let &amp; apos ; s go &amp; apos ; ) is a recording by the hard bop Art Blakey jazz ensemble .
It was recorded in Los Angeles in 1964 and issued on the Limelight label .
Following the departure of stars from his 1961 to 1964 band , Freddie Hubbard , Wayne Shorter and Cedar Walton , it includes previous Blakey alumni and newer players .
This was trombonist Curtis Fuller &amp; apos ; s last recording as a regular member of the group , though he would return to record sporadically with Blakey in the 1970s and 80s .
The album was re-released on Verve in 2004 . Jeffery S .
McMillan has called the release one of Blakey &amp; apos ; s most underrated works and that it exemplifies his 1964-1965 work .
In a review in the December 1965 issue of &amp; quot ; Black World &amp; quot ; , the title track is describes as &amp; quot ; a diabolical concept , a dark image , invoking the innermost caverns of Manhattan . &amp; quot ; David Rickert calls the album &amp; quot ; a fine Messengers album and a good example of the drummer &amp; apos ; s consistently satisfying work . &amp; quot ; Russ Musto referred to the release as a &amp; quot ; return to a more soulful sound &amp; quot ; .
Ken Dryden stated in his Allmusic review that &amp; quot ; It &amp; apos ; s a shame that this was the only recording by this particular lineup of the Jazz Messengers , as &amp; # 91 ; John &amp; # 93 ; Gilmore &amp; apos ; s strong blowing complements Morgan very well &amp; quot ; .

Gregory ScofieldGregory Scofield ( born July 20 , 1966 in Maple Ridge , British Columbia ) is a Canadian poet , whose work draws on Cree story-telling traditions . Scofield is a Red River Métis of Cree and European ancestry .
He has ancestors from the North American fur trade and the Métis residents of Kinesota , Manitoba .
He speaks the Cree language , and incorporates it into his poetry .
He had a difficult childhood , including poverty , abuse and separation from his parents .
He described his early years in his 1999 memoir , &amp; quot ; Thunder Through My Veins &amp; quot ; . Scofield has published eight volumes of poetry and a non-fiction memoir .
He has also served as writer-in-residence at Memorial University of Newfoundland and the University of Winnipeg .
He has also been a social worker dealing with street youth in Vancouver , and has taught First Nations and Métis Literature at Brandon University and the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design .
Scofield is gay .
He is currently an assistant professor of English literature at Laurentian University .
He was the subject of a documentary film , &amp; quot ; Singing Home the Bones : A Poet Becomes Himself &amp; quot ; , in 2007 . In 1998 , Scofield &amp; apos ; s aunt was killed in an unsolved crime , and this informs his recent poetry .
Most days , he tweets the story of a missing or murdered indigenous woman . Scofield sees himself as a &amp; quot ; community worker &amp; quot ; and his various identities are reflected through his writing .
He initially felt shame of his Métis ancestry because the Canadian school system denigrated Métis history and heritage , and mocked its heroes such as Louis Riel .
Instead , he yearned for a pure Cree identity , conscious that his own grandfather had denied his own Cree / Métis identity due to shame .
In an early poem , &amp; quot ; Between Sides &amp; quot ; , he wrote : Scofield says he learned to take pride in the Métis aspect of his identity after participating in an annual Métis cultural gathering and festival called &amp; quot ; Back to Batoche Days &amp; quot ; . Scofield once feared that his gay identity might destroy his Native community connections .
He initially tried to compartmentalize these identities , but came to understand that embracing both together helps with his community work , especially supporting gay Native youth .
He mentions that his generation &amp; quot ; didn &amp; apos ; t have the opportunities to learn about courting and respect &amp; quot ; , and hopes that his poetry and writing can help the younger generations come to terms with their own identities .
His poetry in &amp; quot ; Offerings &amp; quot ; constitutes gay Native erotica : Scofield won the Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize in 1994 for his debut collection , &amp; quot ; The Gathering : Stones for the Medicine Wheel &amp; quot ; .
In 2013 , he was among many Canadians who received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal . In 2016 , Scofield won the Latner Writers &amp; apos ; Trust Poetry Prize for his lifetime body of work . In a review of Scofield &amp; apos ; s book &amp; quot ; Witness , I Am &amp; quot ; , Nicholas Bradley wrote , &amp; quot ; Scofield is an observer , especially of tragedies , and his poems explore , with speech that verges on song , the meaning of knowing one ’ s place in the world .
Muskrat Woman , the first section of &amp; quot ; Witness , I Am &amp; quot ; , is a long poem about a flood — in Scofield ’ s words , &amp; apos ; a retelling , a reimagining of a much longer âtayôhkêwina — Cree Sacred Story &amp; apos ; . &amp; quot ; Bradley also wrote , &amp; quot ; The poems concern the living and the dead — those who have survived forms of colonial brutality , and those who must be remembered .
Scofield ’ s distressing acts of testimony , mourning , and dissent suggest convincingly the importance of the literary arts to public discourse about matters of grave consequence . &amp; quot ; The jurors for the 2016 Latner Writers &amp; apos ; Trust Poetry Prize were Canadian poets Jeffery Donaldson , Karen Solie and Katherena Vermette .
They commented , &amp; quot ; His forms embrace the musical , the documentary , and the experimental in a vision of risk and generosity .
From raw , urban truths to the solace of Cree cadence , from the heart beat of the drum to the wax poetics of a young Louis Riel , Scofield ’ s range of subject , work , and style dazzles .
He has courage to let us in , and the patience to help us understand . &amp; quot ;

Magic Mirror ( Snow White ) The Magic Mirror is a mystical object that is featured in the story of &amp; quot ; Snow White &amp; quot ; . The Magic Mirror is owned by the Evil Queen and has been depicted in different versions as either a hand mirror or a mirror on the wall .
Every morning , the Evil Queen asked the Magic Mirror the question &amp; quot ; Magic mirror in my hand , who is the fairest in the land ? &amp; quot ; .
The mirror always replies : &amp; quot ; My Queen , you are the fairest in the land . &amp; quot ; The Queen is always pleased with that , because the magic mirror never lies .
But , when Snow White reaches the age of seven , she becomes as beautiful as the day and even more beautiful than the Queen and when the Queen asks her mirror , it responds : &amp; quot ; My Queen , you are the fairest here so true .
But Snow White is a thousand times more beautiful than you . &amp; quot ; This resulted in the Evil Queen enlisting a huntsman to kill Snow White and bring her Snow White &amp; apos ; s lungs and liver . After eating the lungs and liver of a boar that the Huntsman passed off as Snow White &amp; apos ; s lungs and liver , the Evil Queen asked the Magic Mirror the question &amp; quot ; Magic Mirror in my hand , who is the fairest in the land ? &amp; quot ; The mirror replies : &amp; quot ; My Queen , you are the fairest here so true .
But Snow White beyond the mountains at the seven Dwarfs is a thousand times more beautiful than you . &amp; quot ; This caused the Evil Queen to disguise herself as different women to kill Snow White . After the latest attempt with a poison apple which was undone by the Prince and Snow White marrying him , the Evil Queen asked the Magic Mirror who the fairest in the land was , the Magic Mirror quoted &amp; quot ; You , my Queen , are fair so true .
But the young Queen is a thousand times fairer than you . &amp; quot ; The Evil Queen learned too late at the wedding that the young queen in question was Snow White which eventually leads to the Queen &amp; apos ; s death which varied per version . German pharmacist and fairy-tale parodist Karlheinz Bartels suggests , in a tongue-in-cheek manner , that the German folk tale &amp; quot ; Snow White &amp; quot ; is influenced by Maria Sophia Margaretha Catherina von und zu Erthal , who was born in Lohr am Main in 1725 .
After the death of Maria Sophia &amp; apos ; s birth mother in 1738 , her father Philipp Christoph von und zu Erthal remarried .
Claudia Elisabeth von Reichenstein , the stepmother , was domineering and greatly favored the children from her first marriage .
The Queen &amp; apos ; s iconic mirror , referred to as “ The Talking Mirror , ” can still be viewed today at Spessart Museum in the Lohr Castle , where Maria Sophia was born .
The mirror was likely a gift from Philipp Christoph to Claudia Elisabeth .
It was a product of the Lohr Mirror Manufacture ( &amp; quot ; Kurmainzische Spiegelmanufaktur &amp; quot ; ) .
The mirror “ talked ” predominantly in aphorisms .
The upper right corner of “ The Talking Mirror ” contains a clear reference to self-love ( &amp; quot ; Amour Propre &amp; quot ; ) .
Moreover , mirrors from Lohr were so elaborately worked that they were accorded the reputation of “ always speaking the truth ” .
They became a favorite gift at European crown and aristocratic courts . The Magic Mirror appeared in Disney &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs &amp; quot ; voiced by Moroni Olsen .
The Magic Mirror contained an imprisoned spirit who is referred to as the &amp; quot ; Slave in the Magic Mirror &amp; quot ; .
In his first appearance in the film , the Evil Queen would consult with the Magic Mirror to ask who the fairest of one all was .
The Magic Mirror always told the Evil Queen that she was the fairest one of all .
When asked who the fairest of all is , the spirit replies that , while the Queen is beautiful , a fairer being exists .
When the Queen angrily asks for the girl &amp; apos ; s name , the spirit describes her , making it obvious to the Queen that Snow White is the one being referred to .
The Queen then orders her Huntsman to kill Snow White and bring her back her heart .
When the Evil Queen asks the Magic Mirror who the fairest of them all was later that evening , the Magic Mirror told her that Snow White was the fairest of them all .
Though the Queen at first believes the spirit to be incorrect and showed it the heart in question , she is told that she holds the heart of a pig and that Snow White still lives in the Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs . The Magic Mirror appeared in &amp; quot ; Disney &amp; apos ; s House of Mouse &amp; quot ; , voiced by Tony Jay and seen in the lobby of the club .
It would always answer questions given to him by the guests or give advice to the staff members .
The Magic Mirror also appeared in &amp; quot ; Fantasmic ! &amp; quot ; voiced again by Tony Jay . The Magic Mirror appears in &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; voiced by Corey Burton .
The Magic Mirror first appears in Terra &amp; apos ; s storyline .
As per the movie , it told the Queen that Snow White was now much fairer than the vain ruler .
However , it added on that her heart was a pure light than shone bright .
It was then promised by the Evil Queen usage by Terra to find Master Xehanort if he brought her Snow White &amp; apos ; s heart .
However , he did not do so and told the Evil Queen he never intended to .
Terra then proceeds to tell her that unlike Snow White , she has much darkness in her heart .
The Evil Queen , insulted and outraged , commanded the mirror to destroy Terra .
The Magic Mirror refused saying it can only answer questions .
The Evil Queen &amp; apos ; s increasing rage then caused the mirror to have a potion slammed on its face sucking Terra in and fighting him .
However , he is defeated and releases Terra .
The Evil Queen reluctantly has the Magic Mirror tell Terra where he can find Master Xehanort .
The Magic Mirror quotes &amp; quot ; Beyond both light and dark he dwells , where war was waged upon the fells . &amp; quot ; Upon learning this information , Terra takes his leave from the Evil Queen and the Magic Mirror where the Magic Mirror &amp; apos ; s cryptic response would direct Terra to the Keyblade Graveyard .
The Magic Mirror later appears in Aqua &amp; apos ; s storyline .
When Aqua looks for a cure for Snow White in the castle , the still-possessed Magic Mirror drags her into the mirror for a fight , but she also manages to defeat him and is released .
The Magic Mirror then disappears stating to Aqua &amp; quot ; The Queen is gone , my service done .
Adieu , oh victorious one . &amp; quot ; In the Disney Channel original movie &amp; quot ; Descendants &amp; quot ; , the Evil Queen has retained the Mirror after her exile to the Isle of the Lost , reduced to a small hand-mirror that is passed on to her daughter Evie .
Although it is still controlled by rhymes spoken by the user and doesn &amp; apos ; t have an inhabitant in it . A different version of the Magic Mirror appeared in &amp; quot ; The 7D &amp; quot ; voiced by Whoopi Goldberg .
This version is a female that serves Queen Delightful of Jollyland . In &amp; quot ; Once Upon a Time &amp; quot ; , the Magic Mirror started out as a Genie ( played by Giancarlo Esposito ) where he and his lamp were discovered by King Leopold .
King Leopold feels no need to wish for anything and uses the first and second wishes to free the Genie from the lamp and to give the third wish to the Genie .
The Genie expresses the desire to find true love , so King Leopold takes the Genie to his castle as he believes the Genie can find true love there .
He falls in love with the King &amp; apos ; s wife Queen Regina and gives her a hand mirror .
The King reads in the Queen &amp; apos ; s diary that she has fallen in love with the man who gave her the hand mirror and asks the Genie to locate him .
The Queen is then locked in her room to prevent her from leaving the King .
To free her , her father has the Genie bring her a locked box , which turns out to be filled with poisonous vipers from Agrabah so the Queen can kill herself .
Instead , the Genie uses the vipers to kill King Leopold and allow the Queen to be with him .
She tells him that since the vipers were from his country , the guards will find out that he was the murderer and flee .
Realizing the Queen never loved him , he uses his wish to be always with her and to never leave her sight .
This traps him in the hand mirror .
As a spirit in the Magic Mirror , he is able to move between and see through all other mirrors in the Enchanted Forest .
He is used by Regina to spy on and locate others . In Storybrooke , he is Sidney Glass , a reporter for Storybrooke &amp; apos ; s local newspaper &amp; quot ; The Daily Mirror &amp; quot ; .
On Regina &amp; apos ; s request , he researches Emma Swan &amp; apos ; s past to help Regina expel her from Storybrooke .
After Graham &amp; apos ; s death , Regina attempts to appoint him sheriff , but the wording of the town charter calls for an election .
He loses the position to Emma Swan .
Regina has him removed from the newspaper staff , and Sidney goes to Emma , claiming that he wants to expose Regina as the corrupt person she is .
However , the exposé reveals Regina &amp; apos ; s attempts to improve the community .
Despite this , Sidney tells Emma that he will help her take down Regina , but it is revealed that he is secretly in league with Regina , who is using Emma &amp; apos ; s trust in Sidney to gain leverage over Emma .
Emma later learns that he planted a bug in a vase glass after it is used to tip off Regina upon discovering a key piece of evidence that would have cleared Mary Margaret Blanchard of Kathryn Nolan &amp; apos ; s murder .
Emma confronts Sidney and realizes that he is in love with Regina .
Still , Emma presses him to help defeat Regina .
However , after Kathryn is found alive , Sidney falsely confesses to kidnapping Kathryn and framing Mary Margaret so that he could &amp; quot ; find &amp; quot ; Kathryn and become famous .
Later , a cell labeled &amp; quot ; S .
Glass &amp; quot ; is seen in the hospital basement &amp; apos ; s psychiatric ward .
The name &amp; quot ; S .
Glass &amp; quot ; is visible on a door in the first season finale , suggesting that Regina had locked him in the Storybrooke Hospital &amp; apos ; s psychiatric ward after he confessed to the kidnapping .
In &amp; quot ; A Tale of Two Sisters , &amp; quot ; Regina frees Sidney Glass from the psychiatric ward to be her Mirror again in order to enlist him into helping get rid of the people that are in the middle of her happiness .
Regina temporarily places Sidney in the mirror to find the exact moment in which Maid Marian was apprehended by Regina &amp; apos ; s men .
Regina later consults with Sidney on how to change fate .
Regina tells Sidney that the villains in the book don &amp; apos ; t get a happy ending and wants him to find the writer of the book so that she can make some changes like allowing the villains to get their happy endings .
In &amp; quot ; Breaking Glass , &amp; quot ; Regina has Sidney Glass look for the Snow Queen &amp; apos ; s hideout in order to force her into thawing Maid Marian from her freezing spell .
When Emma arrives to know where Sidney Glass is , Regina states that she &amp; apos ; s too busy to tell her where Sidney Glass is .
Sidney later reports to Regina about where the Snow Queen is hiding out after his failed attempt to get a leverage on Regina .
Using a compact to remain in contact to Sidney Glass , Regina heads in the directions of the Snow Queen &amp; apos ; s hideout .
Regina later admits that Sidney was in the mirror .
Upon strong winds reaching Emma and Regina , Sidney states the Snow Queen had swayed him to her side as Elsa &amp; apos ; s ice bridge breaks .
After Emma and Regina defeat a large Viking made of ice , the Snow Queen takes the compact that Sidney is and retreats .
At her hideout , the Snow Queen frees Sidney from the mirror as she wanted the mirror that he was trapped in to go with her mirror that she is putting together .
The Snow Queen states that she wants the mirror that Sidney Glass is in since it is filled with dark magic .
Before declaring Sidney free , the Snow Queen advises Sidney to get a warm coat since it is &amp; quot ; going to get cooler around here . &amp; quot ; In the TV miniseries &amp; quot ; The 10th Kingdom &amp; quot ; , a magic mirror is a key element of the plot , as protagonists Tony and Virginia Lewis travel from New York into the fairy-tale realm via a traveling mirror , which they subsequently lose and must spend the rest of the series searching for , while their enemy , the evil Queen and protégé of Snow White &amp; apos ; s deceased stepmother , spies on them with other magic mirrors .
The travelling mirror that brought them to this world is destroyed in an accident , but an old mirror referred to as Gustav- which can only communicate and respond to queries made in rhyme- reveals that there were two other travelling mirrors made , with one sunk at the bottom of the ocean and the other in the possession of the Queen .
With the Queen &amp; apos ; s defeat , Virginia returns to New York through the Queen &amp; apos ; s travelling mirror , although Tony decides to remain in the fairy-tale realm to enjoy his new status as a hero . The mirror in &amp; quot ; Faerie Tale Theatre &amp; quot ; was played by Vincent Price , whose face appeared as if mounted on the top of the mirror ( in reality , Price stuck his face through a hole ) .
This mirror , as did all of the Queen &amp; apos ; s ( Vanessa Redgrave ) other mirrors , turned black as she found out that Snow White was alive . The Magic Mirror appears in the &amp; quot ; Snow White &amp; quot ; episode of &amp; quot ; Grimm &amp; apos ; s Fairy Tale Classics &amp; quot ; .
It is kept in a cabinet in the Evil Queen &amp; apos ; s chambers .
Like the story , the Magic Mirror told the Evil Queen that she was the fairest of them all until the day when Snow White came of age .
In this version when the Magic Mirror told the Evil Queen that the Seven Dwarfs freed Snow White from the deadly laces and that she can &amp; apos ; t be killed when she is in their protection , the Evil Queen breaks the Magic Mirror vowing to prove it wrong . The Magic Mirror appeared as the Looking Glass in &amp; quot ; Happily Ever After &amp; quot ; voiced by Dom DeLuise .
When Lord Maliss asks him where his sister the Evil Queen is and threatens it for information , the Looking Glass tells him that she has died trying to kill Snow White .
After Snow White evaded Lord Maliss &amp; apos ; dragon form , Lord Maliss consults the Looking Glass again as the Looking Glass tells him that Snow White and the Dwarfelles are heading to Rainbow Falls .
When Snow White ventures to Lord Maliss &amp; apos ; castle , the Looking Glass tells him that it will be tough for Snow White to find his castle .
When the Dwarfelles enter Lord Maliss &amp; apos ; castle and wonder where Lord Maliss has taken Snow White , the Looking Glass states that &amp; quot ; beneath the Queen lies a secret door . &amp; quot ; After searching the area , they find a panel to the hidden door underneath the Evil Queen &amp; apos ; s bust . In the 2013 SyFy film &amp; quot ; The Hunters &amp; quot ; , it is revealed that the Magic Mirror was inspired by a fabled mirror that is said to grant the wish of whoever looks into it ; supposedly , the mirror triggered the Dark Ages .
The mirror was sought by an ancient army known as the Krugen before the hunters- a group of scientist knights dedicated to protecting fairy-tale artefacts- acquired the mirror , breaking off four shards from the mirror and hiding them and the mirror away when destroying it completely proved impossible .
The film focuses on a family of hunters , the Flynns , with the parents being experienced hunters seeking the shards to keep them away from the Krugen and their sons being forced to take up the hunt when their parents go missing .
The mirror is eventually reassembled by the film &amp; apos ; s antagonist , but he is tricked into making a wish that caused the mirror to destroy him , with the protagonists subsequently wishing for the mirror to destroy itself . In &amp; quot ; Snow White and the Huntsman &amp; quot ; , the Magic Mirror appears as a golden gong-like mirror that oozes out a hooded robed being ( voiced by Christopher Obi ) whenever Queen Ravenna called upon it for information , although apparently , the being is only visible to Ravenna , as her henchmen observe her talking to thin air .
The Magic Mirror first appeared where he told Queen Ravenna that Snow White was coming to the age where she will be more fairer than Queen Ravenna .
The Mirror is last seen when Snow White defeats Ravenna , ending the Evil Queen &amp; apos ; s rule . In prequel / sequel , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; , the Magic Mirror ( voiced by Fred Tatasciore ) is revealed to hold darker forms of magic .
He is seen in flashbacks of Queen Ravenna &amp; apos ; s tyrannical reign , where it tells Ravenna that her sister Freya will give birth to a child who will exceed Ravenna &amp; apos ; s beauty as the fairest of them all .
The Mirror also predicts that if the child was to be harmed , Freya will unleash powers , prompting Ravenna to orchestrate the murder of her own niece , both to preserve her own beauty and , in her own twisted way , help her sister .
Freya , in horror at her discovery , releases icy powers that kill her lover and turns her hair white .
Years later , after Ravenna &amp; apos ; s death , the Magic Mirror has gone missing while travelling to a Sanctuary where Snow White believes its evil can be contained .
It is revealed to be in the hands of a troll in a forest , but Freya , seeking the mirror for herself , orders Sara- the Huntsman &amp; apos ; s presumed-dead wife- to retrieve it .
Although Sara obeys this order , she tricks Freya by sparing Eric &amp; apos ; s life .
Freya &amp; apos ; s subsequent attempt to use the Mirror herself reveals that Ravenna had hidden a part of herself in the mirror , restoring her to a form of life apparently formed of the Mirror &amp; apos ; s gold while still appearing human .
In the final confrontation , Freya learns the truth about her sister &amp; apos ; s role in the death of her daughter ( Ravenna was now the mirror spirit and was thus bound to answer Freya &amp; apos ; s questions truthfully ) , prompting her to aid Eric in destroying the Mirror at the cost of her own life .
However , the final scene shows a golden raven flying away , suggesting that a part of the mirror - and thus Ravenna - may have survived . In the film &amp; quot ; Mirror Mirror &amp; quot ; , elements of the Magic Mirror are featured as a large mirror that serves as a portal to the Mirror House where Queen Clementianna consults with the Mirror Queen ( played by Lisa Roberts Gillian ) .
To access the portal to the Mirror House , Queen Clementianna would quote &amp; quot ; Mirror Mirror on the Wall . &amp; quot ; The Mirror Queen would always advise Queen Clementianna not to use dark magic for her own gain .
After the aged Queen Clementianna takes the slice of an apple she was to give to Snow White from her , the Mirror Queen declared that it was Snow White &amp; apos ; s story all along as the Mirror House and shatters the Mirror House . In Jim C .
Hines &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; Princesses &amp; quot ; series – chronicling the adventures of Snow White with Princess Danielle Whiteshore ( Cinderella ) and former Princess Talia Malak-el-Dahshat ( Sleeping Beauty ) after their tales concluded with Snow and Talia being banished from their kingdoms and taken in by Danielle &amp; apos ; s mother-in-law – Snow White is a sorceress who uses her mother &amp; apos ; s mirror as a key focus of her spells , relying on various smaller mirrors to maintain a link to it when away from the palace ; her power is commonly focused by using various rhymes as spells , although she can create other spells without speaking .
The fourth novel , &amp; quot ; The Snow Queen &amp; apos ; s Revenge &amp; quot ; , reveals that the magic mirror was created by Snow White &amp; apos ; s mother imprisoning a demon and binding it to her service .
The plot suggests that the mirror &amp; apos ; s role in the original story was motivated by the demon attempting to create a set of circumstances that would allow it to escape , inspiring Snow &amp; apos ; s mother to attack her daughter so that Snow would inherit the mirror and some day make a mistake that would let the demon out .
In the novel &amp; quot ; The Snow Queen &amp; apos ; s Revenge &amp; quot ; , the mirror shatters after Snow tries to perform a particularly complex spell , allowing the demon within it to possess Snow while shards of the mirror corrupt others , forcing Danielle and Talia to return to Snow &amp; apos ; s kingdom in the hopes of rediscovering the secrets used by Snow White &amp; apos ; s mother to bind the demon in the first place so that they can try and exorcise it from Snow .
After this plan proves impossible due to the demon &amp; apos ; s interference , the demon attempts to recreate a larger ice-mirror to summon further demons into this world , using the part-fairy blood of Danielle &amp; apos ; s son Jakub – Danielle having some fairy blood in her from her mother &amp; apos ; s side of the family – but a reflection of Snow &amp; apos ; s untainted self helps protect her friends long enough for them to destroy the demon , at the cost of Snow &amp; apos ; s life . The Magic Mirror appeared in Episode 685 of &amp; quot ; Sesame Street &amp; quot ; with the Magic Mirror &amp; apos ; s face being the face of Jerry Nelson .
In the &amp; quot ; Sesame Street News Flash &amp; quot ; segment , Kermit the Frog interviews the Magic Mirror on which question the evil witch will ask him and tells Kermit that it is the same question where the Snow White answer &amp; quot ; drives her up the wall . &amp; quot ; The witch who is the fairest in the land , has two beautiful eyes , is green , wearing a hat , wielding a microphone , and is in the same room as the Magic Mirror .
The Magic Mirror states that Kermit the Frog is the fairest .
The witch then notices Kermit the Frog hiding behind the curtain and states that he is good-looking . In &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; , this version has the mirror a property of Lady Claudia ( Sigourney Weaver ) .
It is a wooden closet with a statue as the door and hands acting as locks .
It is regarded as a family heritage artifact by her .
Snow White &amp; apos ; s nanny , tries to see what &amp; apos ; s inside while cleaning it and immediately suffers a heart attack .
The mirror displays a beautiful and younger version of the Queen who advices her what to do .
The mirror also contains her life force and she ages rapidly when Snow White stabs the mirror and then engulfs in flame of the burning room . The Magic Mirror appears in the &amp; quot ; Shrek &amp; quot ; franchise voiced by Chris Miller .
It is depicted as a mirror with a live spirit communicating through it , and with magical displaying abilities . Near the end of the video game &amp; quot ; Simon the Sorcerer &amp; quot ; , the player can use the Magic Mirror in Sordid &amp; apos ; s tower as an surveillance monitor , using any reflecting surface like a camera . In the &amp; quot ; Sisters Grimm &amp; quot ; series by Michael Buckley , the Magic Mirror appears as a minor protagonist in the first six books , but is revealed to be the main antagonist in book seven and remains evil until near the end of book nine . Here , the wicked queen Elspeth possesses a hall of magic mirrors , and a hand mirror that displays several attributes not seen before .
The Queen may command the hand mirror to terminate enemies ( as she did to the Huntsman ) , use it as a means of transport or step through it to change appearances , even turning others into animals . A parody version of the Magic Mirror appears as a recurring character throughout &amp; quot ; The Suite Life of Zack &amp; amp ; Cody &amp; quot ; voiced by Brian Peck .
It is a high tech mirror that often compliments London Tipton &amp; apos ; s attire . A direct representation of the Magic Mirror in &amp; quot ; The Suite Life on Deck &amp; quot ; episode &amp; quot ; Once Upon A Suite Life &amp; quot ; voiced by Michael Airington .
It is seen when all the characters are dreaming of themselves in the classic fairytales such as Snow White , Jack and the Beanstalk and Hansel and Gretel . Appearing as a magical object in the Business Office , the Magic Mirror is a minor protagonist in &amp; quot ; The Wolf Among Us &amp; quot ; .
Usually demanding its request be given to it in rhyme form , the Magic Mirror is capable of showing a brief vision of its requested subject .
The Magic Mirror &amp; apos ; s shattering and the search for its missing shard play key aspects following the end of the second episode . Although the magic mirror does not appear directly in the Asylum film &amp; quot ; Sinister Squad &amp; quot ; , it is referenced as a key part of the film &amp; apos ; s backstory ; when Rumpelstiltskin destroyed the mirror to prevent the forces of Death claiming it , it transferred several fairy-tale characters into our world , with Rumpelstiltskin relying on fragments of the mirror to sustain his own magical manipulation abilities until the final confrontation with Death .

Spanish land grants in FloridaSpanish land grants documented claims of land ownership when Spain ceded the territory of Florida to the United States in 1821 .
Under Spanish rule , land grants were offered to settlers beginning in 1790 , to induce settlement of the colony .
The United States agreed to honor these land grants when it gained control of the territory , provided that they were shown to be valid . In 1819 , under the terms of the Adams-Onís Treaty , Spain ceded Florida to the United States in exchange for $ 5 million and the American renunciation of any claims on Texas that they might have from the Louisiana Purchase . The United States required that residents had documented or testimonial proof of the validity of their land grants .
Land commissions and other government bodies reviewed these claims , either confirming or denying their validity , and thus the ownership of the land .
Dossiers were assembled for each land parcel , consisting of survey plats , deeds , wills , royal grants , and other documents supporting the claims . In 1942 , the Spanish land grants were first published by the Work Projects Administration &amp; apos ; s ( WPA ) Florida Historical Records Survey .
The records were transcribed into a five volumes , with an introduction written by historian Louise Biles Hill .
More recently , the State Library and Archives of Florida published digitized copies of the land grants online .
Mapping L . A . Mapping L . A .
is a project of the &amp; quot ; Los Angeles Times &amp; quot ; , beginning in 2009 , to draw boundary lines for 158 cities and unincorporated places within the Los Angeles County , California , 114 neighborhoods within the City of Los Angeles and 42 unincorporated areas where the statistics were merged with adjacent cities . The project began in February 2009 with the posting online of the first version of boundary lines for eighty-seven Los Angeles city neighborhoods .
The map was then &amp; quot ; redrawn with the help of readers who agreed or disagreed with our initial boundaries . &amp; quot ; The media company said : &amp; quot ; After reviewing this collective knowledge , &amp; quot ; Times &amp; quot ; staffers adjusted more than 100 boundaries , eliminated some names and added others . &amp; quot ; According to the &amp; quot ; Times , &amp; quot ; the project &amp; quot ; was created by the Data Desk , a team of reporters and Web developers in downtown L . A . &amp; quot ; The &amp; quot ; Times &amp; quot ; said that the Mapping L . A .
project became the media company &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; resource for neighborhood boundaries , demographics , crime and schools . &amp; quot ; The results as posted are searchable by address and ZIP code or by individual neighborhood .
It noted that : The maps cover the 4,000 square miles of Los Angeles County — by far the most populous county in the nation — from the high desert to the coast .
In 2009 , there were an estimated 9 . 8 million residents , up from 9 . 5 million counted in the 2000 U . S .
census , the basis for The Times ’ demographic analysis for each neighborhood and region .
Unlike most other attempts at mapping L . A . , this one follows a set of principles intended to make it visually and statistically coherent .
It gathers every block of the city into reasonably compact areas leaving no enclaves , gaps , overhangs or ambiguities . The &amp; quot ; Times &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; database editor , Doug Smith , and a researcher , Maloy Moore , standardized the neighborhood boundaries &amp; quot ; based on historical and anecdotal definitions , civic proclamations and reader commentary . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; Thousands of city blocks &amp; quot ; were converted &amp; quot ; into a complete picture of Los Angeles neighborhoods , with no ambiguities , overlaps or missing pieces . &amp; quot ; The website provides the following categories , among others :
Aouzou , ChadAouzou ( ; Arabic أوزو , alternatively Aozou ) is a small town and oasis in the extreme north of Chad , situated within the Aouzou Strip .
It was the site of the Battle of Aouzou , during which Chadian forces captured the town from Libya in August 1987 , followed by its recapture by Libya less than a month later .
The town was formally transferred to Chadian control in 1994 , along with the entirety of the Aouzou Strip . In the early 1980s , the total population of the Aouzou area and the nearby valley of the Enneri Yebige was estimated to number around 1,300 persons .

Anatole de BaudotJoseph-Eugène-Anatole de Baudot ( 14 October 1834 – 28 February 1915 ) was a French architect and a pioneer of reinforced-concrete construction . He was a prolific author , architect for diocesan buildings , architect for historical monuments , and a professor of architecture .
He is known for the church of Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre in Paris , the first to be built using concrete reinforced with steel rods and wire mesh . Anatole de Baudot was born on 14 October 1834 in Sarrebourg . He attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris , where he studied under Henri Labrouste and Eugène Viollet-le-Duc . He won the Grand Prix de Rome . From 1863 , De Baudot was involved in the subject of education of architects , related to reform of the Beaux-Arts , writing several articles on the subject .
In 1865 he was among the first members of the École Spéciale d &amp; apos ; Architecture .
Others were Ferdinand de Lesseps , Émile Pereire , Eugène Flachat , Jacques-Charles Dupont de l &amp; apos ; Eure , Jean-Baptiste André Godin , Eugène Viollet-le-Duc and Émile Muller . Anatole de Baudot became a respected writer on architectural subjects for journals such as the &amp; quot ; Gazette des architectes &amp; quot ; and the &amp; quot ; Encyclopédie de l &amp; apos ; architecture &amp; quot ; .
He was employed by the government in 1873 as an architect for diocesan buildings . In 1879 he was appointed to the historical monuments committee , eventually becoming inspector-general in 1907 . From 1887 to 1914 he was also a professor of History of Art at the Trocadéro . De Baudot retired in 1914 and died in Paris on 28 February 1915 . De Baudot contributed to the &amp; quot ; Gazette des architectes et du bâtiment &amp; quot ; ( 1865-1871 ) . His influence converted the journal into a more serious publication , reducing the number of articles that served as advertising . He was a polemic writer , denouncing the decline of architecture in the 19th century , whose roots he traced to the abandonment of Gothic architecture principles in the 17th and 18th centuries .
He also blamed the teaching at the Beaux-Arts . After November 1888 De Baudot was head of the &amp; quot ; Encyclopédie de l &amp; apos ; architecture &amp; quot ; , and with his collaborators Paul Gout and Henri Chaine devoted the journal to promoting modernist concepts . He would remain in charge until 1892 . He introduced photography of archaeological sites and of monuments . A series covered the buildings erected for the Exposition Universelle ( 1889 ) . In 1890 De Baudot also became responsible for publication of the &amp; quot ; Bulletin de l &amp; apos ; Union syndicale des architectes français &amp; quot ; . This may have served as a distraction from his work on the encyclopedia . Anatole de Baudot took great interest in churches . He noted that the practical problem to be solved was the same in the 19th century as in the 13th century . In an 1866 article in the &amp; quot ; Gazette &amp; quot ; he pointed out that the main requirements for church builders were to cover large spaces with few internal supports so that many believers could move easily , and to meet the needs of the religion . In 1869 he published &amp; quot ; Église du bourgs et de villages &amp; quot ; , which discussed and compared old and modern forms of churches , arguing the case for constant improvements in architectural design . The minister for public education and cults designated him architect of diocesan buildings in 1873 , and he rose to the position of inspector general of diocesan buildings in 1879 . De Baudot was made a member of the Committee on Historical Monuments on 27 March 1879 . He was appointed Vice-President of the Commission of Historical Monuments in 1880 . In 1907 he was appointed Inspector General of Historical Monuments . In 1882 Anatole de Baudot was appointed architect for the new Lycée Lakanal , a boarding school in Sceaux set in the former park of the Duchess of Maine .
It included the administration building , classrooms , studies and dormitories , baths , kitchens and dining rooms .
