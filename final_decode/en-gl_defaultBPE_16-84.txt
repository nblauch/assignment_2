It was a back after 2005 .
He was just based on a scientist in ACLO , the AOO Lagos .
I love my work , but I thought that day like a little bit of them .
So I came up to my roommate turned on my roommate , Chris Hareness .
Now , Chris &apos;s about 30 years ago , I &apos;ve been doing this good of the institutions of the institutions of the institutions .
I told adory what I felt like a little bit bitves .
I was showing him a series of questions about the state of the science and wheat voice , very interesting .
But I wanted to be that ACLen has been a broader problems in a way that could a difference for a difference .
Now , Chris was particularly on the big and asked me , &quot; &quot; So all those questions , what are the five thing to unagree ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the decrimination of genetics , the new technologies , the bioar bioban and ...
You know , there &apos;s a great thing , the field of the NMR diagnosis as a common detector of the world .
Well , what &apos;s the issue of the genetic pay . &quot; &quot; Paal genetic ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s , the way of genes in genes . &quot;
&quot; No !
&quot; &quot; And what &apos;s the American government that we &apos;ve given up from the human body ?
It can &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll take it for my disutil , and I send me to tell you three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he came to him to focus on them .
&quot; Rai . There are no ! who &apos;s what you do ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a great relawyer , but I didn &apos;t know it &apos;s nothing about the carign and absolute mind of genetic .
And I mean something about genetic , but it wasn &apos;t lawyers , much less lawlaw in the bones .
And he turned from that there was a lot to learn before anyone .
First , we had to know what he was trying to know when someone has been a gene .
The consequence of genetic genetics is , but the more argument of all of all , but the more argument of all are called &quot; &quot; DNA &apos;s &quot; &quot; is , a piece of DNA that I &apos;ve done from a cell .
And I couldn &apos;t pay about this , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t pay the genes from your body , we can take the genes goes . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s real , but the problem in which we need to have been food for using them .
And the helent wouldn &apos;t coneat a gene deficits in particular one of it , but all the nuclear gift of the gene gene .
And what does that mean ?
Now , what you can &apos;t look at your genes a physician and ask that the test test , to see if they were mutations , without it , without it &apos;s like that .
It also means that the continent comes to the right right to the right right to be able to be able to use there , and we produce clinical measures .
I want to tell you that these heads , often companies were private , breathing parts of the human gene was to prevent patients .
We have the case of Alicoco , a little 10 years with a bit of 10 years with a piece of high , a disease that , if it &apos;s not going to be able to be able to death over .
The company that paid the two genes associated with this disease , which is going to diagnose the syndrome .
But then it has been up in crainism and never remained them back .
But the company that would take the pays the bsequence with cancer , but the company that would be a threat to be used to pay it .
Two years , the years of no power to test .
For that time , Aliic died of killing helps without diagnose .
The genetic way was a problem that removed out to the patients .
Was there some way to make front of them ?
Well , it turns out that the Tride — it has been been in a long long list of cases , that there &apos;s a series of things that it &apos;s not like to be surprised .
They can &apos;t get their nature products : air , the water , the water , the elements of the look at the most of the good part .
It doesn &apos;t use the laws of nature : the law of gravity , and it &apos;s foot .
They &apos;re really important things , and they need to be at all of us , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to have a full of all of us .
In our opinion the DNA , the structure of the most mental life , that encodes the production of all of our proteins , it &apos;s so much in the nature of the nature , independent that if you think of our bodies like one of our bodies
To put us better , we took all the country to talk to different with different experts : scientists , exquisitely doctors , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers
Most of us , I told us that we had been been from a point of view , and , when less in theory , from a piece of view .
They think the chance of them are going to go back with our lives so many like scratch .
But why do you ?
It turns out that the office model , but so the office of 20 years ago .
It was literally , there was thousands of glack of genes .
Now the French Square was very gutsed in the status of the status , the industry of biotechnology were going to be enough , and it &apos;s legisening to rejected the genetic proof year , but the legislation for the genetic
Briefly , the grandfathers were not going to be willing to be willing to be willing .
But and I don &apos;t even say , and I don &apos;t don &apos;t have been able to take scared of them , and they said , &quot; &quot; You have reason not enough , &quot; &quot; You have reason not enough . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s
So we started to see our cause .
The traditional judgments cues , and they &apos;re going to gather to the E , by some subject , dark and it use .
We don &apos;t in the interested in the that kind of causes , we think that our cause would be happy more than much more .
It &apos;s based on a freedom of freedom , mice progress and human rights .
So we decided to tell you a cause that we don &apos;t be like as the way that there are for the bones , but a cause of the human rights .
We &apos;ve set out to identify a look at the genetic way that was to afford to deftain their advertise of the advertisement of a few times in order to organize the advertise of patients and experts that they were going to be able
We call them that the bank invisible to put it was Murch Gquare , a company with this company with the Salt C&apos;sy , UOah .
He was called the barrier of the clinic of two genes , genes , and the BRC2 .
And the women with certain mutations have more genes to get cancer , and in all the year .
And a tradition about the top of the BCC tests in the United States .
And I want to be able to be able to be able to stay from us from an BCC tests .
They were a lot of money on his test : Goant 3,000 dollars .
They come to share his data measures with the international community .
And if the rest of all of all of all of all of a hundred years ago , I was going to become a test of the test that depends mutations that were identified by a team of France .
And so he described that for that period , for a hundred years ago , to a hundred percent of the women that they &apos;ve made the aderry response : a negative result it should be able to be better .
This is Kuwait Matin .
The Beath Karaley , Esays , it was developed cancer with 40 years , and he made the test My .
The test gave me been negative .
Sfamily coges .
The more likely that that cancer were not been present in the family , for the other members of family should not needed to test .
But two years later , Kuara was given one cancer in the opposite .
And it turned out that of Kuine was found between that 12 percent of people who received a great language .
And they will take the result , Kuine would make the test , and it would brought his cancer cancer .
They could make us to make these problems .
I &apos;ve organizations to be genetic , organizations of dealing , four organizations could be able to represent the most of 150,000 scientists , and women who or not could be able to pay the test of Mai , or it wanted a second point
One of the ocean &apos;s parents , we &apos;re going to start this case was thinking about the way that to explain the science .
And to imagine that what I &apos;ve done Murson wasn &apos;t a hinter , and that the genes is up of the nature of the nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , of a type : What is a gene ?
How if it &apos;s the DNA , and why that &apos;s not a indog ?
We &apos;ve got these hours of thousands and hours with our plentiful and experts , trying to make the way to explain that these concept of simple shape .
And the end of the end , we were going to be a good hand for me , like the orion of the hilly .
So it &apos;s the DNA is like it &apos;s like to extract or a mountain or the milits of a river .
It can be bring their process to extract or pull , but you can &apos;t pay their own or rock .
You think about how it &apos;s going to pull the mountain ; they can &apos;t eat it , it &apos;s being sick .
And the branciscos , you can use it in all kinds of things that can &apos;t use when he was in the mountain ; it was in the mountain ; it was in the mountain ; it &apos;s not going to do the mountain . ( Laughter
In 2009 , we were ready to present the case .
And we gave it a shke in the TNan Foundation in the relationship from New York City , and the case came up open , to the judgment Robert Sweranarket .
In 2010 , the judgment Square were used to see it : 22 pages . There &apos;s the top of us for us .
When it &apos;s going to opinion her opinion , gimous us to get into the science in the case .
I mean , our report — it was pretty good , but not so good .
How could it be able to develop a knowledge of knowledge of the subject in so little time ?
We don &apos;t have been able to imagine how it was possible that &apos;s possible .
So it turned out that the whole thing he worked into the judgment Snitment , not just lawyer — he was scientist .
And it wasn &apos;t just scientist — he had a molecular molecular biology .
( Laughter ) You &apos;re foking .
So Mary he appealed to the Triry of the master of Crain Freen .
And there were interesting things they were interesting .
First , in a moment of this case , government in the United States .
And in the whole thing about the distance of the distance of the distance of the Murch , government .
But in fact to their own office school in the bones , government came a report of the light of the decision of the decision that he said that that the whole light light of the decision of the decision that he said that that the DNA was
This was very important , and it didn &apos;t stop it .
And the Tks of the right thing from the Citizens Ftop has all the dropout cases , and it &apos;s called his rewaration very , very the protomer of the payless way .
So even with this happened , we decided to lose it .
And so it was .
Rather or less .
The decision that &apos;s 22 takes 1 .
But the two principles to voted against us , they did it all of it entirely different .
The first one , the judgment Levil , he created their own and new theory , noise .
( Laughter ) .
He was surprised to arify that , so he didn &apos;t have a sense .
The other judgment , the judgment Mos , she said that they were taught with us as the DNA comes to the nature .
But that , &quot; I don &apos;t want to tell you a medical industry from biotechnology . &quot; &quot; The third thing , the judgment runs , it &apos;s all the reason .
You have to take to the question that you &apos;re brought up the prepared to the opposite question .
So these questions will take a way of a set of death , just often a page with lots of lots of lots of eight , &quot; &quot; where it &quot; &quot; chicken .
We did that if it &apos;s the most trait that you &apos;ve got received .
Could the words : I &apos;m like to look at the genes ?
When I said to tell me what I thought of those words , I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I think you have to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No .
I want that the judgment has the same reaction that I was talking about this old thing there &apos;s seven years . &quot; &quot; And of course , what would I mean ?
And the Tks Institute , it &apos;s only one percent of one percent of the cases , and you accept for our .
( Laughter ) Now the day of the village , and it was very exciting , very exciting , with many people with many people , people who took waiting for the 2 : 30 of the top .
Two organizations against the chest cancer , they recommended to be a man in the hall of the judic .
Now , Chris , &quot; &quot; I met them together , and I showed them together , when he tells him to turn the most important case on his career .
And I was much more more than it .
But all of the panic has evolved when I saw in the room and I saw in the room , it &apos;s a bunch of faces like — women that I knew that that was being created their stories is a lot of the person , the
In the room , they also were three steps of the Sciences Xs , and it has the bank on the room , James Wenson , who came to a report of the room , which would say that he came to a report of the
A village .
Now Chris care of no way .
But for me , the more father was going to see the judgment of Trian Children &apos;s trying to understand the DNA , through a series of recently , and specifically measures , very similar way how we did the last seven team ago for the
Industrial Kids — you associate the island of DNA to extract a cost .
And the traditional judgment Robert is not to make a baseball glove from a tree .
And instead of it was my favorite moment , the judgments were that the DNA , &quot; &quot; was nature to waiting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When we go out that day in the time , it was very quietly , but then it would have
&quot; &quot; So that &apos;s natural natural language is one of the nature and it &apos;s not clear to be able to be able to be because he was been able to be able to be able to be because he was made .
And what &apos;s more , Murson didn &apos;t created anything . &quot; &quot; We integr and four hours to the decision , five monkeys that would start to be based on the test of the genes for genes .
Some of them all of them have been able to be based on the oldest test My .
Some of the rest of a test test , it was exposed with it was suffering Mary .
But because of the decision that he was suffering from Mary .
And he was studied with a 25 of 25 years that would afford to make human genes in the United States .
They wakeed at the innovation that was innovation and research care .
And they help that patients like Acococo , Kuference and am not prepared to harm that they needed .
As a few weeks later , I was a little bit out of the decision that I &apos;ve got a little bit out of the box .
So I was in the Buress teacher , a teacher of the University of the environment , and one of the first people that I do , and because we &apos;ve been visited to do it .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ve got a lot of this case .
A art of what we gave us to show those risks was to know that we were doing the right thing .
The process of the last year has been eight to the end of the end , with a lot of the way , and you &apos;re seen on the way .
Now , it &apos;s lucky to help us , but there were the communities that we &apos;re going on , and the slowers that we &apos;ve lost .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And it &apos;s . I &apos;m going to show you to show you a wonder of eight from my projects , facts in collaboration with the artist &apos;s papers .
You have to call R &amp; and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object with my first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The phone was &quot; &quot; The phone was &quot; &quot; The phone was &quot; &quot; The phone was &quot; &quot; The phone was &quot; &quot; The phone was called &quot;
When I grew up , the thing was the worse and I &apos;ve tried to see a form of control .
Of course , I didn &apos;t mean , nothing that the time is a very resited figure out at the book .
What I was going to go to me , and you would get him to his use of the phone as well .
He would take the kidight , and I hope that I have gone into the number of him .
And the answer is , and a gift for my great question , I got it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as long one of the two people to change it .
It &apos;s exactly the way that my great man used to get a person .
The problem is that , when I looked at home and I went to college , I started to be more than their choices .
And so I did that I did a few machine to write the ones that could give their safion the prriess and neide from all the world through the rock .
And what I had to do was to take a paper , we have a piece of paper , to write the high paper , trying to write the paper .
This device would love a person in a question , it &apos;s going to get a electronic email .
So here you can see that we were to be a lot of cybored health understood all the things and become digital technology .
So my great question it is with a mechanical interface .
And of course , the object is that they have a lot , and you have a ritualism of harmism , like I like my great time .
The next job is a bit of sensitive to sensitive to sensitive to be on the &quot; &quot; The Pigig . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the way to be surrounded from a single creatures of my creatures , sensitive and put out
This works like this . We have these teacher has here in the wall , behind , behind , we have these little creatures that he was away .
Instead , we &apos;re looking at silence , I &apos;m able to do .
And if there &apos;s more silence , and you &apos;re looking at the garden .
And in the case , it takes out of again .
So , we have these set of multiply in three room on a room .
And we &apos;ve been about 500 of these little bash was born behind .
And that &apos;s how it works .
This is a prototype of video .
When there &apos;s silence behind the cybercriminals .
And people like the humans or the real creatures .
And they turn into the sounds that are the little bit there .
It &apos;s not necessary the sounds of it .
You &apos;re going to go on in a moment that doesn &apos;t easy .
( Laughter ) But it keeps the sounds in the first plain . You can see that in a second .
( Laughter ) We work really hard to make the most real system .
Each wall has their own behavior , psychopath , changes , heart , etc .
This is a very preced a very premature .
Of course , it was the best after that .
We wanted to do that responds to people , but we saw that people were pretty young and child with them .
This is a device of video . &quot; &quot; Art person . &quot; &quot; And we were pretty confined with this idea of play in unvisibility .
So how would it would be possible to experience the visibility ?
We work with a company , we &apos;ve asked them to create mental cameras with using a camera that could look at people in the room , to follow a camera that could look at people in the room , to follow this camera that could look at people
And I &apos;m going to show you a very premature protomic .
On the right , you can see with my colleague Soron , which , in space , is in space .
And the left , you see the video process where the camera is invisible .
He used by the fourth . Wow ! I &apos;m invisible .
You can see how the camera is and the story .
It &apos;s a premature video , chicken that we don &apos;t treat the tongue , and all that , but he was suffering back .
So we &apos;ve done this in a room where there was a camera at the space and we had a monitor in every wall .
And second people came in the room , you &apos;re going to see themselves in the monitor , I think about a difference , a person was constantly invisible where you have to move on the room .
This job is called &quot; &quot; The subr of the L . &quot; &quot; That was almost like a piece of paper , like a reminder of a piece of paper , like a tong of a hand hand or a sun .
For front , this object went to be very strong and health , and it &apos;s almost very weak .
People would walk on the room and you can &apos;t ignore thinking that he was some toy .
But instead of going to get us , we would start to be shopping by the wall in the way .
They will be happy and they were going always .
( Laughter ) This is this job is a cartoon of a gutil man .
His head is so heavy , full of heavy tells us , which seems to fall on his hat , and his body grows from almost like a plant .
What it &apos;s does is to move around your head as if I was feeling at a very fable motion , but extremely slowly .
It &apos;s like unhappy for that circles .
Because if that truck , he didn &apos;t have out there and the sun was really going on , start to the gut back by space .
And there &apos;s no way .
I &apos;ve been wondering about one example , when people come into the room , it will use this object .
And , it &apos;s very slowly , in a few minutes , and it seems and he looks like that &apos;s a coffee point .
This is a moment , because we wanted to be in the tong at the redest of almost going to go and help or to save the subject .
But I don &apos;t have to need because it &apos;s the same person who has gotten another time .
This is a truly challenge that &apos;s a truly challenge for us , and we work really hard , like most of our jobs , for years , like one of our jobs , for years , a balance and an dynamic dynamic .
It was very important for us to be a lot of test , which would be a test , because if the balance of the balance , then , and if it wasn &apos;t not enough , I didn &apos;t write that wrong , and that they didn &apos;t
And I &apos;m going to show you a very fast video , where we do a dry test . It &apos;s much more fast .
That &apos;s my roommate . Drust them .
Now if you take nervous , so it &apos;s going on .
But I don &apos;t have to do , because it &apos;s going to get up for it .
This is a work that we &apos;ve been very confronting , working with the whole skin in the environment , working with thousands of diverse , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
And it &apos;s the scale of the West sky .
Let &apos;s take this out of a dream with the skin , he was born from the table .
The idea was contrast to something so cold and boring , like the universe , the universe , the universe , with the universe , and it &apos;s very commatic and I &apos;ve done .
So the idea was that somewhere we were going to look at the way of a wall , and you can be feeling out as a level of in space , as if you &apos;re going to look at a cooking sky .
This is the last job , it &apos;s still in process , still in process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; As a high space in front of the room , and that , there &apos;s a couple of a big hand , try to be based on
Now , this object is in constant constantly , and it &apos;s used to create a lot of people will eat themselves , as it can try to join a secret in their family together or something like that .
We work with a lot of technology , but actually we don &apos;t like , because it causes a lot of suffering in our work for years and years .
But we used because we &apos;re interested in the way that we &apos;re interested in the way that we &apos;re helping us to sense of these creatures that we create .
When a creature comes to the mind , and it &apos;s almost like the process of it was going to discover the way that this creature wants to discover the way that this creature wants to go and how they want to move and as they want to move
Thank you .
( Applause )
And I &apos;m going to start to start to start a simple trick , not technology , and everything requires you is this : they change from the two minutes .
But before I would tell you now , I want to ask you now that you look at your body , and what you &apos;re doing with it .
Now , how many of you are some shoes ?
In contrast , with the windows , the city fires .
Sometimes we put the arms that .
Sometimes we go up with it . ( Laughter ) I want to tell you .
I &apos;ve been paying attention to what you are now .
We &apos;re going to go back to this in a few minutes , and I hope that you &apos;ve learned is going to improve the development of your development in your life .
Well , we &apos;re fascinating with language language and interrupted , especially the language of other people .
You know , interrupts — this , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is a look look at a look at , a spark is a look look at , a spark of the eye , and even something like a list of hands .
Sstorytelling : This is going to come to the number 10 .
This police have really fortunate , and they give the president of the United States .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) I wonder — ( Applause ) I love to talk to a few weeks , or weeks , and weeks .
And so BB , and at New York .
So when we think of it in expression or language with language , we have the common language that we call the language , we talk to language , for so communication .
When we think of communication we think of interactions .
What does your language language ?
What do you change ?
There are reason to believe it &apos;s the right thing .
Sociologists like this , we &apos;ve been a lot of time or about other people , over the judgments .
We do judgments and doubt the language of language .
And the traditional judgments can prefer projections important as the people we use or using a measure of what we used to be able to give us a measure of adolescence .
For example of 2005 Square , found out in the University of TTme , demonstted that when somebody look at about 30 years of films on the waste of a doctor &apos;s learning about that doctor &apos;s going to be handy or not .
So it &apos;s not going to see so much with if the doctor was or not unstable , but it &apos;s not unnecessary , but it &apos;s not really in that person , and they &apos;re interacting .
It &apos;s still more important , the black Ltonton , we started us that the judgments of all the other hundred percent of the U.S. and the same thing , in the size of the U.S. and even in the U.S. and same , at the U.S.
If you do a wrong of them is bad idea , right ?
Speaking of language will not see about how to ask other , how we &apos;re looking at to the other , as we &apos;re going to ask us , and what &apos;s the consequences .
But we understand to forget the other audience on the other audience that will not see it , that we &apos;re us .
We &apos;re used our language not see , our thoughties , feel and physiology .
So that language doesn &apos;t see it ?
They &apos;re a social concentration — from crossing social judgments and deep in a little bit of view of business , so that was inevitable that they &apos;re interacting in the power of power .
I were interested in the deepphones of the deepphones in the power of the power and of them .
What are the deepphones of the deepphones in the power of the power and of the school ?
Well , they &apos;re this .
In the animal , they have to see with expanssion .
It &apos;s going to be getting big , to go , stop space , basically it opened .
He &apos;s got you to put it .
And it works like all the animal .
It &apos;s not limited to the class .
So humans we do the same . ( Laughter ) So they were going to be able to do , and it could be powerful in the moment .
And this is especially interesting because we &apos;ve shown you the gas , and you &apos;ve shown you to see the Northies of the power of the power of it .
This expression , which is called Jessica Tins , ( Laughter )
Which tells us that as the people who ever see from that they &apos;re born from as the people that are blind , they &apos;re very similar freezing the same when they have a common competition .
So when when they crossing the gas line and win it doesn &apos;t really matter if it &apos;s ever ever seen .
They have so much .
And the arms peaks , what he did something in a scale .
What do we do when we are helpless ?
We do the opposite right .
We do it . We did .
You have a little .
We don &apos;t want to change with who &apos;s our own .
And so the animals like humans we do the same .
And this is what happens when it happens when they could with helpless .
What we need to do when it comes out of power is emotional to see each other .
So if you &apos;re going to be very powerful with us , we need to make them more .
We do the opposite .
If you see this behavior in the class , what do you ?
And so the student in the MBA have been going to see power out of power .
There are people who are cartooning from the album , they &apos;re looking at in the middle of the same before they &apos;re going to start to come to class , as a little bit of them .
When they come , they seem to viral .
They &apos;re just making it like that .
Then there are other people that make practically rotcally .
And so it &apos;s in their face and his body , sit on the coffee and they go on the chair and they go on the chair , and they &apos;re going to get together , and they will bring your hand .
So here you look at all two things .
One is not going to be surprised .
You need to see with sex .
The women are more than the men that men .
The women is always less powerful with those men , so it &apos;s not surprising .
But the other thing that I tried is that it seems to be able to be able to be able to be related to the student , and with his level of events .
And this is really important in the BBB in the MBB , because the difference to the average side of the note .
The schools of the business schools is fighting the difference to sex as sex .
You see women and men also ratings and then you see these differences differences in not , which is something to be common to part of being involved .
And then I started asking me : if there are people who enter with that attitude and participate .
Now , what would it would be possible to do that other the end , and that is the leads to participate more ?
My collaborator that I knew that he &apos;s in Beethoven , and I &apos;d like to know if you can stop to do it .
I mean , you can do it just for a second , and you experience a result in your behavior that feel feeling more powerful ?
We know that language will be able to see it that other people without them and think of us . There are a lot of tests .
But our question was : It &apos;s an language not going to see what you feel , and we think of us ?
There &apos;s some evidence that it &apos;s .
For example , or , when we &apos;re happy about , but also when we &apos;re going to do that he was trying to test a lot with teeth like that , it makes it shoes .
This is going on in two direcations .
When it comes out , it &apos;s also working in two direcations .
When you would be able to be more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we pretend to be powerful , it &apos;s more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be
Well , the second question was , well , we already know that the mind of our body , but it &apos;s true that the body measure our mind ?
And when I say , instead of the power , I &apos;m talking about ?
Well , I &apos;m talking about it and feel that of the exquisitely concentrated and feel those things and feel , and in my case , talking about hormones . And I look at the hormones .
How is the mind of the power of the power of what they don &apos;t ?
The people can tend to be , it &apos;s not surprising , more and safe , more optimistic .
They have the feeling of that they &apos;re going to win the future game games .
They also tend to think of a more boring way .
And there &apos;s a lot of old differences .
There &apos;s a lot of difference between the power between the power and what you don &apos;t .
Fromma , it &apos;s also a differences in two hormones , the test , that is the hormone of the countries , and the waste , that &apos;s the stress of stress .
The mrain will be a lot of power in order to generate levels of levels of the countries have been tested and levels of waste and thousands of power power and thousands of power and thousands of power power and thousands of power and thousands of power power
That means this ? And I &apos;ve been talking about it , I have been talking about the exception , because I had to see with the school .
But the power of it has to see with our stress to stress .
So we want a picture of why , with a lot of power , with a lot of powerful , and it sit into stress ?
It &apos;s not , right ?
We want a lot of person that would be powerful , and it doesn &apos;t be sensitive to be sensitive to the stress , a person that &apos;s worth able to .
We know that in the spring of the material , if it &apos;s a mole that take the control , if someone has to take the control , if someone has to make the control , take a time , and you get to focus on a lot
We &apos;ve got that evidence , that the body can deunitate the mind of the mind , at least the academic level , and also the role of the role of the mind .
So what happens when you would come to the paper of paper ? What happens if it makes a fstan level , like this little man or interactive ?
We gave up , &quot; &quot; I want to tell you for 2 minutes you &apos;ll get that , that &apos;s going to look more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
We decided to bring people to the lab and to make a small experiment , those people who made , for two minutes , the ratings , of genetic , and the ratings , of simple , and I &apos;m going to show you to look at the two
This is a one .
A couple .
This prits called the &quot; &quot; he was beautifully . &quot; &quot; He was beautifully .
We have a couple more .
They can be foot , or no enough .
So here are the lack of fear .
Now white , they get little .
This is very rare power .
When you can see these in these rooms , really .
This is what happens .
They come , with a coco , and we told them for two minutes , &quot; &quot; They can &apos;t see this or the photos .
We don &apos;t want to give them with a power of power .
We want out the power of it .
So let &apos;s take this two minutes .
And then we asked , &quot; &quot; As a powerful sense of you — then we gave them the chance to bet , and we gave them the other demonstration of themselves .
That &apos;s all . This is all the experiment .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found .
So they were like to risk , I bets ; we found that when they &apos;re in in a global position can fail to leave J6 percent .
When they are in the traditional paths , it &apos;s just 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant difference .
Let &apos;s look at what we found with the test .
It ealed from his normal situation , the normal people would see , that people would be able to find out of 20 percent , the road will experience the top of the 10 percent .
So again , 2 minutes , and you &apos;ve got those changes .
Now the results with the bush results .
And the more powerful experience that a 25 percent of diture , the most mobile will experience over from 15 percent .
I just two minutes , made these changes features that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to make it to be able to be able to do it to be safe or environments , or unclear to the stress , and I felt it sustainable
We all know that feeling , right ?
Fair that our language will not see the way to see us , not only the other , but ourselves .
The body can change the mind .
Now , the next question , of course , it &apos;s — maybe a power of power in a few minutes , they change human life ?
This is in the lab , this experiment , are just two minutes .
Where can you really do this ?
That &apos;s what you worked .
We think that where you need is to look at the bottom that you brought us , as in a social measurement of the social path .
And so you &apos;re going to be able to go to your friends that you &apos;re going on .
For the American teenagers is in the concert table .
For some people &apos;s talking about the school in school .
It can be on to present to your business or giving a talk like this or going to go into a job between work .
We &apos;ve got one with the most people who identify because they identify because many of it &apos;s going to work .
And then we looked at the results , the hot results , and she said — well , this is what there &apos;s what you &apos;re going to go to a difference , not ?
( Laughter ) Of course , let &apos;s be shocked and said , &quot; &quot; No , God , not what we wanted to say .
So a lot of reasons , not .
And again , it &apos;s not about talking to other people .
You want to talk to you .
What you do before they &apos;re going to go to a difference ? I do this .
It &apos;s sitting . ( Laughter ) You look at the iPhone or your Android , we &apos;re not going to stop no outside .
It turns up . There are my love , you &apos;re his love , they &apos;re doing small , when you should work to be doing is this , maybe in my mind , OK ?
So that &apos;s what we want to evaluate , right ?
We &apos;re using people to the lab , and they give up a high and deep powerful , and he has been a sense of the job to work in fact .
In five minutes , it &apos;s great filure .
They also &apos;re looking at , and the gesture are drank , we don &apos;t want to see the defenses as well .
Imagine that this person told you .
For five minutes , nothing , it &apos;s worse than you interrupted .
People show this .
It &apos;s what Marine YFrank calls &quot; &quot; to be in the blood movements . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s why I &apos;m going to get you .
This is the between that the path we have , because we wanted to see what happened .
We have some company looking at , four in the top .
They don &apos;t know that means . They &apos;re not sure the conditions .
They don &apos;t even have no idea that I have made every person , and the end of go into all your own , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to make these people . &quot; &quot; Well , we want to keep these people .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to want to be used .
So we did that a monitor , look at the &quot; &quot; What was happening ?
This is not about content in the speech .
This is the presence that they came into the speech .
Because we evaluate them into all these variures is to the construction , and he &apos;s in the speech ?
Would you really good ? What are ratings ?
These things don &apos;t affect . This is that there .
So this kind of things .
Each person was tiring by the same .
They show what they are .
They show their ideas , by themselves , without any extra .
So this is what that means or transble the effect .
When I talk about people about this , which our body changes our mind and new behavior can change our mind and new treatment can change our way , say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s done .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m looking at ice until the flies .
I &apos;m not like that .
I don &apos;t want to get there and tell you like a piece .
I don &apos;t want to feel like a impossible .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feeling it was not there .
And this is really important to me , because I want to tell you a little story about being a impossible story about being a impossible , and about myself who wasn &apos;t there .
When I had 19 years old was a terrible car accident .
I was looking at it and I was several loops .
I was going to get rid of the car .
I went on in the UCL with a head . &quot; I &apos;ve told me about college , and I told me that my CII , I told me that my CII , I told me that my CII , I told me that my
I met my Children , I &apos;m going to go back as super-symhes , and they ask me to a girl .
So I &apos;m great to college , I went back again .
They said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t stop your career .
You have to accept that there are other things that you can do , but in your case that &apos;s not . &quot; &quot; I had to deal to deal with that and I have to tell you that it has been able to be able to be able
He felt not helpless .
And then I worked , and I worked , and I had done , and I had done , and I was lucky , and I worked .
Finally was there in college .
I started four years old with my fellows , and I tried to say someone , my brancis , I use Fomton , so I &apos;d agree , and I &apos;ve been thinking about , and I &apos;ve been thinking about , and I &apos;ve been
night , I was given up from the top of the 1 .
That &apos;s that .
I had so much of the red worm , the next day I call it up and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll stop . &quot; &quot; She told me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m told me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t leave you , because I bet
They have , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
And the exhibitions do all the exhibitions they are .
It just just to do , and to do and do it &apos;s still that the frightened or even paralyzing and with a personal experience , and with a personal experience that says &quot; &quot; the damage , learning . &quot;
I arrived up to here . I &apos;m going to do it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
I have a few years ago , a few years ago , you know , in Vory , I &apos;m convpped to Harvard , I &apos;m not to think about it , but for a long time I had to think of it , but by a lot
The window of my first year in Harvard , a student who didn &apos;t have been talking in the kind of the entire entire term , which he said , &quot; &quot; look at , you have to participate , &quot; &quot; back , you have to participate
Absolutely blind , said , &quot; He didn &apos;t want to be here . &quot;
That was my time .
Because it happened two things .
The first thing I &apos;ve asked me : I &apos;ll ask ! I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to tell me like this .
I don &apos;t want me like that . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going on in your place .
The second thing was , it must be here !
So we can say , and it can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . Yes you must be here ! &quot; &quot; Come .
He turns out , you &apos;re going to be able to be a powerful , and you know what — ( Applause ) You can see the best speech of all — &quot; &quot; And I know , and I don &apos;t even be surprised that if he was
So I just change .
Now I want you to tell you what we don &apos;t have to do it .
There &apos;s to transform it to transform .
There is that it has enough to evolve and interact .
And the last thing I &apos;m going to tell you this .
You have any changes can be able to be great accurate .
I &apos;m just two minutes .
And so we &apos;re going to conconfront to the next situation where you &apos;re going on , for two minutes , take out of this , in the co,or , in the radical room , on the room in the door .
This is what you have to do .
You tell the brain to make the best point .
We remember the Turing test . Bigate the Fsun .
You can &apos;t get out of that situation like what I don &apos;t told them who they are .
So in that point , I &apos;m going to tell you that , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to show you .
I want to ask you before you share a position of power , and I would also try to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My way doesn &apos;t really depends on this . ( Laughter ) Personally , I wanted to do the people , because the best can we have to do that with resources and technology , without no position .
Person with them because they can do it in prison .
They only need their body , ice and two minutes to the projections of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So what I &apos;d like to talk is about the biggest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to tell you about &quot; &quot; The Bmonist Ear — which is that it &apos;s a good option we can .
( Laughter ) Now I &apos;m going to talk about what the great problems of the world ?
And I mean , before we brought you to each one of you that you would take him back and paper , because I &apos;m going to ask you to help you to see how we do .
So he turns on it back and paper .
In the end of you , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world from there .
I &apos;m going to do some of them .
&#91; 80 million people pass me .
He 6 million people don &apos;t have access to water water .
Two millions of them without us .
In white millions of people die and AIDS .
Pepor continks .
Two millions of people that if you &apos;re going to be able to be able to have been able to have been known for the video game , and it &apos;s .
We have a lot of many problems there .
In a world , we gave us all , but we don &apos;t do it .
The truth is that we don &apos;t solved all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do the question , what I think we should do — and that &apos;s what we are in the basis of the economy — is , if we don &apos;t do all , we really do we start to be asking , what are
That &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
And if we have to say , 50 million million pounds to trade in the next four years to improve this four years to improve this world , at what we should go up ?
We &apos;ve been 10 of the most big part of the world , and just I just read — Ma , Mas , and the water , of the education , subrition , and gathering and drill down to eat it .
We think these , many ways , many ways of the world .
What is the question would be asking , what do you think they are the biggest ?
Why should we start to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s asking yourself about a problem that &apos;s ugmed .
In reality , that was hydrogen by what he talked to you in January .
But to close it , there &apos;s a problem if you want to people that fall into the problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
So you think the biggest of the problems we have in the world is that we all dies .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So the thing is not , we &apos;re used to be in the problems that were used to the problems .
And I said , of course , it makes a little bit more complicated .
To get Apple mutants would be something like Kunas .
To arferrate , they could be clinical records , and they were going to be clinics for the mosquitos .
To the rules , it would be at the forces of NNU , and we could stop up .
And what I &apos;d like to ask you to ask you , and that in 30 seconds — and I know that I think is a impossible thing — write what you think are the unset of alities .
And also — here is , of course , where the economy is , where the economy is going to do in first place .
What should be at the end of the list ?
So I just sent 30 years ago , maybe people were talking about people care , and just just imagine what they should be all the top of different communities , and the less scale of the solutions that we have for the world &apos;s problems .
The key of this process — of course , I want to say , I want to say , I want to say — I just want to tell you about a important minutes of my time , right ?
I &apos;d like to be deeply , and I want to think about this process , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
And also , also highly recommend , and I &apos;m sure that we also have to take these argument after , to think , how is a way to do ?
Since then , there is that if you ask a same thing , why did you have been done a list before ?
And a reason is that bitation is absolutely essential .
Nobody wants to do .
Of course , all of course , all of the organizations I want to be on the most of a list of a list .
But also , it has also all all of these aside of fact would not be into the bottom .
And so there &apos;s a lot more . &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t numbers in the &quot; &quot; to be numbers , it &apos;s logical , I don &apos;t want to want a list of me .
There &apos;s 60 years ago , and all of it &apos;s not done a few other things that we can do in the world , and say , what we should do first ?
And that doesn &apos;t mean that we &apos;re not going to be rejected — each &#93; is an bial , so that despite the fact that we are , but that , we &apos;re going to be able to do it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s
So what I &apos;m looking at is really saying that we had , for a very long period of time , a situation , where they could have advanced choices .
There &apos;s a lot of things that we can do there , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , but we didn
We didn &apos;t have a idea .
Imagine that in a restaurant and you have an enormous way , but we don &apos;t know what they are changing .
You know that you have pirated , but we don &apos;t know what it is .
It could be a cup , it could be 1,000 dollars .
Would it could be a proxy for familiar . I could be a proent proxy , right ?
You want to know these things .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to try to make the status state — it &apos;s out of the precision of these issues .
And so , this is the process of the Northton process .
We take 30 of the best principles of the world , three of every year .
So we &apos;ve had three of the best principles of the planet from the planet has been close to play video games .
What can we do ? What will be the cost ? And what makes a good cost ?
And the same thing to put it .
Three of the best experts saying , what can we do ?
What &apos;s a price ?
So what should we make care about that , and what would it be a result ?
And so in front of them .
So we took the certain of the best principles of the world , eight of the best economies of the world , including three village set , together in Cubble , and they &apos;re born in MAPen in 2004 .
And we call the &quot; &quot; Dam Dam &quot; &quot; The prediction of the Cambridge decided to call the Ricid Prize to die of the economy .
It works , it works very well in Europe , but there &apos;s not so much .
And , basically , basically what did did , it was actually going to get a guy bial .
And then , let you ask , why do you show it ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy that I &apos;ve done that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The thing is that , obviously , if you want to know about malaria , questions , a experts about malaria .
If you want to know about climate , if you want to know about climate .
But if you want to know what of the two , you must ask first , you can &apos;t ask any of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what they do in Britain .
We &apos;ve set out .
We &apos;ve been that reread something that you have to say , we should do first , and we should have to do after .
So this is the list , and this is the list I want to share with you .
Now , you can see in the website , and I &apos;m true thing that we also &apos;ll take about it with the day .
Basically , I just take a list that there were bad projects — but , more where you get one of the way , and you &apos;ve been less than a result .
And then they were the projects of the right projects , good and very good .
And of course , they &apos;re the projects of the projects that we should start to do .
And I &apos;m going to start to start from the last way that we try to begin with the best projects .
And these were the bad job .
As you can see at the end of the list is the end of the list is just ready .
This is about a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things about what people says that people can &apos;t go .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why come ?
And the truth , I also try to talk about again , because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we don &apos;t want to do with knowledge that you don &apos;t get .
The reason that it turned out that this is that Kyta — or to do something more than Kinggh — it &apos;s not a good business because it &apos;s very seide .
It &apos;s not saying that we didn &apos;t mean it &apos;s carrying .
It &apos;s not saying that &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying what we can do for that it &apos;s very bit , a very little cost .
And what we &apos;ve made essentially us , the middle of all the average models , and that Kyla , if everything you &apos;ve been done , would would have a thousand billion .
That &apos;s a important amount of money .
Two girls or three times we actually tell the development to guess the development that we know at the Third World of every year .
And so to do very little good .
And all of the constructs do you would know , warming about six years to the 2100 .
So a kind of Banglah that &apos;s called an ii6 in 21 , you &apos;ve been waiting to 2106 .
What it &apos;s well , but not very good .
So the idea , well , we spend a lot of money doing something well .
And just for a baseline , NNU I &apos;ve half this amount of a number , about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the other problems with the world in the world .
We could take water water , they &apos;re using schools and education , all the human beings in the planet .
So let &apos;s ask you , we want to figure out how they make a very little bit ?
Or after half it doing something much good ?
And it &apos;s there where it comes into a wrong project .
It &apos;s not saying if we &apos;ve got all the money on the world , I don &apos;t want to do .
They sit , that when we don &apos;t have , it &apos;s just the first one of us .
The projects of the right projects — — I &apos;m going to tell us all — but disease , the services of healthy , and it &apos;s the very bit , the scale of basic other health is a great thing .
It might be much well , but also , but it &apos;s very happy .
One more , what we say , and we &apos;ve turned to think in the two sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , they need a lot of projects of healthy .
Once else , the cells and the water is absolutely important , but it also costs it a measurable bit there .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four app a little bit that they should be , when less , the first to be able to talk about how we should solve the problems of the world .
And the fourth overth is malaria — treated malaria .
So in the malaria , it &apos;s about a couple billion people in every year .
It could even make a certain point of the PNB , the year for the polar bears .
If we &apos;re going to get about a thousand million dollars to the next four years , we would have to bring a half of half .
We could solve to death for 40,000 people , but what maybe it &apos;s more important , we would have to prevent millions of people if they will go into every year .
We would call his ability to treat a lot of other other problems that you &apos;re going to face . In course , in the long time , also appds to be global .
Well , the third better is the free of us .
Basically , the model came out that if we could take the free free , and especially waiting to the end of the USA , and Europe , we could have essentially it to the global global economy , the top of the year , half of
Once else , we &apos;ve been really able to take 200 to 300 million people in poverty , radical and very fast , between two and five years .
That would be the third better thing we could do .
The second better thing would be going to focus on nutrition .
It doesn &apos;t be used by general as a economic way of treating , and it &apos;s saying , the lack of microsx .
Basically , half the population of the world has failing of mistake , untie out and vitamin A .
And if we found 12 billion dollars , we would have to make a deep slide in that problem .
This is the second in the top of us that we could do .
And the best project would be used in HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we found 27 billion dollars to the next eight years , we &apos;ve been to solve 28 million in HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this does , and what we do is to say that we have two different ways that we &apos;re going to address with HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and another is the prediction .
Once else , in a wive world , we would make them two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of the two or where we don &apos;t do it very well , we should be , as less , asking us where we should get first .
And the treatment is too much , much more expensive than it .
So fortunately , in what this is going to do it is to say that we can do much more investment in the prexy .
Basically , to the amount of money that we will do . We can make it quite well in the treatment , and 10 times more in the prexy .
So one , we &apos;ve been focusing to it more than able to treatment , as the first option .
What this does is that really makes us to think in our scale .
I &apos;d like to you look at your list of wonder and told you , how do you get you ?
Or , they &apos;re going to go to something like that we did here ?
Well , it &apos;s one of the things that &apos;s really really really clicked .
I talk about many people who thinks it &apos;s very , but they think they did that .
We also should do long-lived mutants , if there &apos;s no other thing , if it &apos;s a great problem .
But naturally , of course , we didn &apos;t happen to each other .
We have a lot of problems in the world .
And what I want to tell you that if we were showing us in the problems , and we retire on the most right happening .
Now , what we can do a lot more like a little bit more than well .
And I think , the truth — Thomas Sardinia , one of the participants of the &quot; &quot; gam ) &quot; &quot; , she explained it , very good .
One of the things that people are born , and that in 100 years ago , when we &apos;re talking about most of the way of the people of user customers , people will be a lot , much rich rich .
Even the trenches of the outside of NNU in NOU .
So the average person is that the average person in development in 21 will be as rich as we are today .
And much more likely to be two to four times more than we are us .
And of course , we will be even more than that .
But the question is , that when we talk to save people , help people in Bangk in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking to about the poor .
We &apos;re talking about a gain to you get pretty rich .
And so the real thing , of course , that &apos;s why , we want to get a lot of money helping a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of 100 , here about 100 .
Now , how do we want to help these poor , in the Banglah , who needs really help , and who we need really help , and who we can be very politence ?
Or as I said , as I said , &quot; &quot; So what I said , &quot; &quot; So what I said , &quot; &quot; So what I said , &quot; &quot; So what I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how they were
Even if they don &apos;t seem to do with a problem .
And of course , that &apos;s truly , because they lived customers have a good photos .
You know what we have &quot; &quot; He &apos;s great , it &apos;s great , not ?
It &apos;s a good movie movie in the sense of what I want to see , and I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I don
So in many of , I think the Swedish Cchosesels and all the argument about the way of the way , it &apos;s a deal of the problems of boring problems .
And to it to make that it &apos;s not just to make us feel well .
And it &apos;s not going to do the most thing that you have the largest appnt , but it &apos;s also about a number of places where we can really do a much greater good thing .
The other objections , I think , they &apos;re important , it &apos;s a important thing that I &apos;m a man was — or we &apos;re going to propose an elction of it .
Of course we have to do it all , in a wive world — would be entirely enough .
I think we should do all the things , but we don &apos;t do it .
In 1970 , the developed developed developed as we &apos;ve done , right now , the same thing , that in 1970 countries in the computer .
And as our fail of it &apos;s going to be half .
It &apos;s not going to be in the way to solve the great problems .
So it &apos;s the same way , people also say , but there &apos;s the war of the Nist ?
You know , we spend 100 billion a person , which we don &apos;t see that well in the world .
I &apos;m crazy .
If some of you can talk to with Benus for that , it &apos;s okay .
But of course the subject all is , that if you have to come to a 100 billion dollars of dollars , all of it really like a better way that possible , right ?
So the real problem , it &apos;s start to be new and think of what are the way .
I should mention it , is this really the list of me ?
You know , when the best principles of the world , hints we all have been wondering about both men and old of the United States .
And they &apos;re not necessarily a great way to look at the world .
So we call the 80 to the world for the world for the same problem .
And all of all two ratings were coming back to college , and he didn &apos;t want English .
Most of them were , first , all of them in the computer .
They had the same material , but they could have been to be a lot of the question of the argument , as they did , to open their own own face .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with nutrition and diseases in the most time , and they have to have the end of the end .
We &apos;ve made this lot of other other times .
There were a lot of other other , and college students and things different .
They all had a result , the same list .
And that &apos;s a great hope , actually , to say that there &apos;s a way for front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of
Of course , in a wive world , we want to eat it all .
But if we don &apos;t do it all , we can start to think why we would start ?
And I can see the state of Cchoseseus as a process .
And we did in 2004 , and we hope together , to be much more people , to get a lot more information in 2008 , 2012 .
They build the right way to the world . But they can begin to think in political music .
And to start to think about , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t do the things that we can win with a different cost , and the things we don &apos;t know that we don &apos;t do , but to do things that we don &apos;t do , but we
If you &apos;re concerned a lot about some things , let us do not worry for each other .
So I hope that this is going to be able to be better , and think we work better for the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I was out of the house without rain .
He had been doing home to the house I visited a friend of the city , because that temperature temperature , and that temperature temperature .
And I was in the way , you &apos;re looking at at the chest , and I realized that I didn &apos;t have my keys .
In fact , it could see the window to the concert table , where the left left .
But they were all closed .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s not about the night in the house &apos; house , because the morning , I needed one to Europe and we need to take out and wrong .
So , of course , and she died in cold to get a letter of letters and stick it into the window to do it .
And I &apos;m going to do many money but not more than a little bit more money but not more than a kid in night .
Well , let &apos;s tell you the neurological neuroscience .
It &apos;s to remember , that moves your heart and high levels of adrench levels of adrench levels of adrench levels of adrench levels of adrench levels of adrench levels of adrench levels of adrench levels of adrench levels
So at the next morning when I went back after the last little bit of the windows , I worze that it was in Europe who had been in Europe in the mind of the fact .
And so until the thirds of the herd was not given me to forget the gatekeet .
So I went out to the house , with snow and ice , in 40 minutes has picked out , I picked up to the gatetime , and I &apos;m going to go to the top of the other person , but let me tell my the
Or , in the case that tells them things , it &apos;s bad things .
( Laughter ) I said to tell me , &quot; &quot; I said to tell me , &quot; &quot; Sey told me to me , and I said to tell me , &quot; &quot; I said to me , &quot; &quot; I read to tell me , &quot;
That was something that I got from the psychologist Green that was written about this was a few years ago , and that it &apos;s called the case .
You get a team of experts that try to determine what happened , not ?
Well , the fact of course , how she explained to say , and then you try to determine what you can do .
So what I want to talk to you today is what we can do .
Some things are enough enough , other don &apos;t so much .
And I &apos;m going to start to start for glasses .
It gets in places for the house for the things that fail .
Well , this is a common sense of common , and it &apos;s like it .
There &apos;s a particular structure of the brain , called hippocampus who evolved for hundreds of thousands of years to remember the location of the years .
And the hippocampus is the part of the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain .
In fact , there &apos;s just a experiment made the experiment to look at the sense of the look at the right thing .
But it works well with things that you can &apos;t get too things that if you &apos;re going on .
So there &apos;s why you &apos;re looking at some place for your keys .
For total sport , a specific stroking , and a specific space , in a specific space .
If you look at a place and if it &apos;s a lot of things they &apos;re going to be in your place when we get .
And when we call a picture with a photograph with your cell lives .
But you a email with the picture that &apos;s going to do it .
These appear things seem to evidence .
Think that when we &apos;re under stress , the brain of the csun .
The gas is toxic , and I &apos;m done .
Science , we recognize any stresses that you can &apos;t give the best one of you , and you should work with some system .
And when you &apos;re going to look at a medical decision .
We all will be somewhere together in a situation of a situation .
And I want to talk to you .
Or a decision that we need to do .
Now , I know that you go to the doctor and this says &quot; &quot; I have the results of the evidence and it has the results of the test , and it has the results of the test , and it has the results of the test ,
You know what the postcard will get down to the ground .
And instead of you think that we have the bank is not very good . And the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to slow a drug that you know you know today , and you know that are one of the drugs that you know today ,
Have you ask to ask a question that &apos;s going to be asking ?
That &apos;s the number of necessary — ( NT . And what &apos;s NNT ?
It &apos;s the number of people that they have to take a person before they help a person .
And they thought , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s this thing is that ?
And the number should be a . The doctor was not going to sat something that doesn &apos;t help .
But medicine does not work like this .
We don &apos;t know the commitment devices .
And the SarkPKara is that 90 percent of the drugs work between a 30 percent of the drugs work between a 30 percent and one 50 percent of the cases , and one 50 percent of the cases .
So NNT in the case that the most prescription , what you think it is ?
How many people have to anyone before you want to tell somebody ?
So this second of the results .
And I look at the data .
And they thought to be thought .
In the case , then the drug , the drug , then , in this drug .
And also things have kind of bad things . &quot; &quot; It sends out of the muscles , and I would say , they &apos;re to behold , &quot; &quot; One 5 percent . I don &apos;t think I want to me .
You have 15 times more chance that the drug you &apos;re going to do .
I &apos;m not saying if I &apos;m going to hear the Eet or not .
You just must have this conversation with your doctor .
You have to have access to this information to be able to talk to you .
I &apos;m talking about this number to below , but actually in NTT &apos;s reality .
The whole thing for cancer . It &apos;s NT is 49 .
Yes , there is there &apos;s to be 49 , for each person that fail .
And the side effects in this case go into 50 percent of patients .
It includes helpless , you can be emotional , it &apos;s actually rotating .
So , the idea of the conversation for the conversation .
The character is not to create this at the moment .
You also think about issues like the quality of life .
These are things in which we must think now and talking about the family , and a few fingers .
Remember : under stress the brain of criminals , and one of the things that happens at that moment is that if you &apos;re going to get a lot of systems .
evolution does the cause that .
because if the body looked like to use these things and we can &apos;t fix it .
Fortunately , one of the things that if you &apos;ve shown you who who had made Dahland and his colleagues .
This is why we need to end for to think of you to have to think you need to be able to think of these kinds of phenomenon .
I think the most important , we recognize that we all have Ox .
In some time we &apos;re going to do it .
So the idea is to think of anticipated in what you can be these wrong , we would have systems that they can feel that things happen .
You &apos;re looking at that night with snowing snow with the snow of the house in the house in the house , and a hard easy to remember .
It &apos;s not not entirely change .
Good ! Go .
Are you be happy ?
Really ? No . Well , there &apos;s no nothing .
&quot; &quot; Come to me , please ? &quot; &quot; Come to Arabic .
And then I look at a strateant .
&quot; &quot; Come out , you sell in this ! &quot; &quot; Well , she said the neighbor .
It seemed like you to have to talk to me , I have to talk to you .
And just a word did that a young boy did .
How can you talk about this ?
In that time I &apos;ve started thinking .
I &apos;m a lot of one .
How do we get here ?
In this same time .
Despite everything .
Now , what we &apos;ve done in college , and we &apos;re going to work . It &apos;s not a language that we can do .
But there &apos;s a more important reality .
There are studies that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to make these different languages .
And when he started to write a little bit in Arabic .
And all of their ideas , their imaginations , and it &apos;s determined .
And when he started to write in English .
But when I was going to write the English written in English .
Can you think it &apos;s the same person .
In a second place that &apos;s killing his language .
So this really really is a developed societies .
The neighborhood , the water , the water , the Japanese person .
( Laughter ) That means that that means still not come to us , but we &apos;ve got to take that world , but we have to take a world .
And so we &apos;ve developed that the developed world . How do we have been developed that the rich developed way that we &apos;re showing , protecting it as a broion .
They celebrate their own .
Because if we take any sensation we know it &apos;s not a location .
No thought it was very much .
We &apos;re used to be consumers , consumers ignored , let &apos;s ignize .
There are very specific specific .
The language isn &apos;t one , two or three words or read in order to use a row .
Or if a child comes out and you say , &quot; &quot; Dad &quot; &quot; in English , and you &apos;re in your English , and you &apos;re in your English condition , and you &apos;re all about the street , and you &apos;re in your English student
How come if they go ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , it &apos;s better , and let &apos;s talk about you .
What I want to say is that those facions are a specific figure out .
I have a friend , I &apos;m talking about sheaven , I have a failist .
One time I asked him that it was all .
And he told me , &quot; &quot; All very well , but once I went to night , and it &apos;s a little bit about my touch , and I read it in the top .
We buy that she &apos;s not to tell him his sea , and it &apos;s normal that he didn &apos;t understand ; his way to think is different .
She told me , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s hearing to French me with me , and one night , I tried to translate that I could say that I feel feeling what I feel aware I feel what I feel that I feel when I feel that I
( Applause ) Well , what we did to protect the green language ?
Tetting us to the society , it &apos;s just a crank , we use to the heart disease .
But I have a lot of people like said , &quot; &quot; Why do you wor ?
This is this point and open to well . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
In the campaign to keep Arabic and keep the next clke .
We don &apos;t said , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t accept this or I am ! &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t accept that . &quot; &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t accept that .
And when somebody else was talking about it , hate your Arabic .
We decided , ( Applause ) We decided that we want to change our reality , and it &apos;s pretty much of the way that reflects our dreams , the aspiris and the day day .
So a way that tells us like us and what &apos;s how we think .
And so , we have to raise the pictures of people and girls dress with hidden characters .
So I &apos;m going to show you a young people and start &quot; &quot; in English .
We &apos;re really called &quot; &quot; with English .
And all that says , &quot; &quot; Hey , you got a word on English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ve spent the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m going to follow saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; .
Or what they think about authority or what they think they have authority about us , instead of the language .
The creativity to the tongue is the way .
Let &apos;s begin from now now .
One single one , it could make over a time .
I could have been close to Arabic again .
But we have to know , and they &apos;re pretty sure that there &apos;s solution , and we have to work that it &apos;s going to be a part of it .
So let me do you about now ?
Let &apos;s look at a few of oil — who is suffering ?
Please love , even for my time , still the end of time .
But I didn &apos;t write in Arabic with an characters .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s not a language !
They were going to fall into a virtual world with virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to the world and go back .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
Sardinians find first to his father .
So when he in my daughter , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; This is ppaner , my breath . &quot; &quot; And I don &apos;t think it &apos;s not , &quot; &quot; FDA is cracked .
What is the case happened in the mind of baby ?
And if we ask this about 30 years old , most people , psychologists family , would say that this baby is going to go to the view of person or wouldn &apos;t understand a process of cause .
In the last 20 years , the science of development has been completely theory .
In the way , we believe that thinks this baby is like the thought of the most beautiful scientists .
I &apos;m just one example of this .
One thing that it could have to think this baby , that it could be able to pass on his mind , it &apos;s going to be able to run what it &apos;s happened in the mind of the mind .
On the end and over , one of the hardest things for all of us is going to try to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that other people are going to do .
And maybe the more hard is to understand that others , and it &apos;s no the same thing that we think and it feels .
Now you think about the political of the politics , the hard that you &apos;re going to get this hard to a few people .
We wanted to know if the babies and children and children would be able to understand this idea about other people .
The question is , how can we ask them ?
Sardinians don &apos;t tell you , and if we gave a child three years ago that you would tell what it thinks , we &apos;re just going to get a Tonight of musences that tells us what it thinks , we &apos;re just going to get a
How can we ask them ?
It turns out that the Chinese East has been brand .
Barnp Rokes , one of my students , and I , we gave them out , both of the food , and one of them , both of the food , and it &apos;s going to give them , both of the food , and it &apos;s
And all of the babies , I was even in Beethoven , they &apos;re going to tell you the cobr , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
( Laughter ) Next , what I was doing was to test food of two advances .
And he was doing that he said , or not what a lot of .
So half of the times , he was doing that they want to do the posts and they don &apos;t go down , as any other baby or blind .
But the other half , it was picked a little bit out and said , &quot; Mmmm , brmmm .
I looked into Emmm . He mm . &quot; &quot; And then he was picked up to me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Ayers , mature , cope .
I looked on the posts . Ajeco , Aslands . &quot; &quot; I mean , he &apos;s doing it as if you take you a one of what I did .
We &apos;ve had this with 15 babies in 15 and 18 months .
And then I hased a hand up , and she said , &quot; &quot; I got a little bit ? &quot; &quot; I call me a little bit ? &quot;
Now , what was a question , let &apos;s put the eyes , what I went to people like them or how people like people .
The surprising thing was that the kid from 18 months , that they &apos;ve been going to start to walk and talk , they get their posts if they get their cobr and the brirens if you &apos;re going to get you to go .
The other side , the babies from 15 months ago that they were so going to be able to do it so he &apos;d like that I &apos;ve been going to cow them , as they could not understand it .
And then after a mouse , it &apos;s a bit of a long mouse , they want to get the world , what they thought that everybody like to everyone .
So there are two data revealed from this .
So one side is that the kid from 18 months to have discovered this important of the human nature : we don &apos;t know the same thing .
It is , they understood that you need to help the other people to get what you get .
And more interesting without it , it &apos;s that the kid from 15 months has not done that ; what suggests to do this ; what suggests to the children of 18 months to learn that deep in the three of months .
So , the babies know the more and learn more than what we were now .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that they did in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve shown this in this fact .
What you can ask now is : Why do kids learn so much ?
And how is that possible to learn as little time ?
I mean , the first thing , the babies come pretty stuff .
And in many occasion , they &apos;re worse than a stuff , because we have to use a lot of time and energy just going to use them alive .
If you look at evolution to look at this myst myst that we lost so long time to take so long time to take a long time to take a few times a few years ago , it turns out , it turns out that there &apos;s a
If you look different species , not only other material , not only other material like us , but also with other my sonion , birds , even marance like the wrong of childhood , and the size of the brain and humanness of the brain and
One example of this one is that one of these birds you can see here .
For a hand , we have a color of New York City .
And the color of them , and other couses , you &apos;re learning , and I trained , they &apos;re very smart face .
In many ways they &apos;re so smart like the full .
And this is a very like a very funny study that has learned to use food to get food .
On the other hand , we have to the chest of us .
The chickens , so as the shoes , I read and yogies , they &apos;re just filling as well .
They &apos;re very good trying to be very good than big , but it &apos;s not really good to anything anything else .
It turns out that the kid &apos;s color from New York City , the pile .
Of course , these rooms were going to put them on the mouth in his mouth , and the two years of life , which is pretty time in the way to a few years ago .
By chickens are now in some of a couple of months .
And so , of childhood is the reason why they &apos;re going to tell you in the front of the front of the Methodists run their chickens .
There &apos;s something in infantrys that seems to be related to knowledge and with learning .
So what does we have to have to do that ?
Some animals , as the chickens , they seem to do a very good thing .
So my parents are really really good as big in a particular environment .
In creatures , as the color of you , they &apos;re not even more doing anything else , but they &apos;re very good likely to increase the different norms .
And of course , the human beings are very far in that distribution .
We have the more big brains to our body , much more than any other animal .
It makes more smarter , more , but , we can learn but , we can be able to live in the planet , and we have decellers across the planet and even face the space .
And our babies , and children &apos;s animals for much more time than other other babies .
My son is 23 .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s less at the 23 , we &apos;ve got to give you those your own open open open open .
All right , why we &apos;re looking at this relative ?
One idea is that that strategy , the strategies of learning , it &apos;s a very powerful way and strong to be a very powerful , and it has a great contempt .
It turns out that it &apos;s learned all , if he &apos;s made less .
And I don &apos;t be good that you would be able to be a mast , and I &apos;ve always thinking , &quot; I have to keep a host or a world ? &quot;
That would be better , we would know that before it looks like .
And the way that evolution invented this problem was , it seems to be , with a piece of the job .
This is why we have this time time we are completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . I just learn .
And then , the adults , we can take that that we &apos;ve learned out , and children and they put into practice to be able to go back into the world .
One way to think about this is that the kid and children and children , they &apos;re like the Nark of the Inuit , and it &apos;s the human species .
They are the people protect them that you have to go to work , learn and have to have great ideas . And we are the production and electricity .
We &apos;ve got to take all those ideas to learn from children and they put them into practice .
The other way of that is , instead of us , and the children like adults , and the children like adults , and the children like adults , and the children like adults , and the children like adults , and the kids would be the ball ,
If this is true , if the babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution in the sample that is , that kids are , that kids are to learn , that the children are to learn , we can wait that they are , that
And in fact , the brain of a baby looks like to be the computer more powerful learning in the planet .
They are still computers they &apos;re going to be able to improve a lot .
There &apos;s there to be a revolution from our way to understand the machines of learning .
And all of the ideas caused of this man , you will go to Thomas Bay , one of the course of the 19th century .
Basically , Bay has evolved to the ability that we &apos;ve used to make the edge of the probability that we &apos;ve used to make the way that scientists would find things in the world .
What the scientists do that &apos;s able to be able to figure out a question , something with what we can start .
And then they &apos;re that thought with tests .
And that &apos;s going to do to change that thought .
So they race the tongate with new evidence , and that &apos;s happening .
And the Bay , I found it was a solution that I could do that .
And the mathematics are the best of the best programs that we have today in day .
There &apos;s 10 years ago , I figured out that the babies would should be doing the same .
If we want to know what it &apos;s going on under the sea of these , I think it &apos;s something very similar .
You found them in the notes of the Bay Bay .
I think the , they &apos;re doing the very complicated components of complicated disciplures that &apos;ve been developed and they &apos;re developed as the world works .
Well , this is even more hard to prove them .
So , if we ask the adult do about this , they can be feeling to be very low .
How is that possible for the children do that statistics ?
And to test this , we &apos;re using a machine that we started to call the World Bwarket .
It &apos;s a box that if it &apos;s getting out of it and all when you take a few objects about objects .
To use this machine as simple , in my lab , and also in other lab , if they &apos;ve heard them about studies about the good thing that are the children about the world .
I &apos;ve been just one that we did with the Kusner , one of my students .
And if you show you this detecations probably could know why the way that the way is placing a business about the detector .
But case is that the detector works a little bit as a little bit .
If it turns on a business out of the detector , something in what we didn &apos;t think about a second , the detector is , that the detector &apos;s to the two of three times in three times .
And while you can take out the block , which is the logical , just if it &apos;s about two of six times in six times .
So , that &apos;s less likely to be more evidence .
It looks like that the strategy to show the object is even effective than another .
So we know these data to four to four years and we pasted them to try to try .
And with security , the children of four years , they use the data and they feed the object out of the detector .
And there are two data together in this case .
The first one , remember that are children for four years ago .
They &apos;re learned to tell you .
But I believe that they &apos;re doing the complex calculation , but in the facts they &apos;re doing a similar range of biased .
The second thing about interesting is that they &apos;re using the evidence to get a idea , a thought about the world , which seems to be more likely to principle .
In a few minutes , we &apos;ve shown you to do that these children for four years , they &apos;re seeing that these children for four years , they &apos;re better than that the adults like the adults , and the same task .
In these complex events , the children do that statistics for you to go to the world , but the scientists were that , after all of all , and we would see if children they were too .
And that &apos;s what we call &quot; &quot; back to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
We just go on one of the lab of Cuine Lagns .
Science has used to be new surgery .
We show it to kids that the blocks were going to work and the red bits , I don &apos;t , like to show you a year .
What we &apos;re going to see is this guy , we could see five hypotheses in a time .
NO : And so ?
NO : You know that in the other side .
Cliver : Well , the first question that go .
NNO : None — ( Laughter ) NO : This guy , but this isn &apos;t .
Cather : It begins to describe the observation .
NN , &quot; Why do this is what he love ?
( Laughter ) NN , I don &apos;t .
They &apos;re still : The scientists can &apos;t recognize that face of desperation .
( Laughter ) NO : Oh , is because this has to be like , and this has to be like that .
Cliver : List , hypotheist .
NNO : So there &apos;s what to be .
NO : Oh , you can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) Air : Now it &apos;s the next idea .
I &apos;m going to tell him to a lot of research that &apos;s excited to be up on the other .
He didn &apos;t work .
NO : Oh , it &apos;s because the light light , it &apos;s not here .
Under this box is electricity , but this isn &apos;t it .
Cather : Well , that would be the fourth question .
NO : Now yes , yeah !
If you put a four to show you .
If you take a four to block in this , and two for them to make another one .
Cather : Well , that &apos;s the hacker .
This kid is — it &apos;s a very kid , and that is that , but she was discovered that it &apos;s a great kid .
If you look at how to play the children , if you ask you to think about something , what they do is to experience .
All of the kids for four .
Well , what if you feel what this kind of creature ?
What if it feel being a ballball of these parks that can make five hypotheses in a few minutes ?
If you look at the psychopaths of psychologists , and open them , many say that the movie , and the children of them are conscious , or even that they don &apos;t .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think , and the children are the most important than the adults .
And this is what we know about how the people works .
Cather and attention to be a bit of a lot .
What happens in the adults is that when we decided that something is important or reimagining , we will be attention .
And so it &apos;s not in it in that in the window , and it will be able to the rest of them that if it &apos;s going on .
We also know how happens in the brain .
When we are attention to something , the front of the brain of the brain , the brain that execusity the things , we &apos;re going to be a signal that a little part of the brain , if a little signal , to learn that one of
We &apos;ve got to be a very much more attention , it grows into purpose .
If you look at the babies and children , we see something differently .
I think the movie , and the children come to have a smaller awareness than a boat than a little bit .
As it , and the children &apos;s a lot of good attention to a single thing .
But they &apos;re really good to you have to be a lot of remote information again again .
And if you look at your brains , what we see is that they &apos;re the exception of basic neurosurgeon that expressed the learning , and in a city , and the insecurity still will not respond to die .
And so when we say that the kid and children have problems to be attention to be attention , what really means is that it &apos;s not not to be attention .
We could take out of the interesting things that you could say something to look at what it &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of awareness that we have to expect from these academic bags that are designed to learn .
If we want to think about a form of feeling of childhood , like adults , I think the best shape is to think about cases , I think that the best shape is to think about cases , we &apos;re not done ; then when you &apos;re a
In those cases , because it &apos;s not to be on , but that &apos;s expanding , why it seems to be that in 3 days in Paris , and experiences that in all the age of house in home , helping you to be able to be
For the way , that falls , that girl &apos;s fall to take down the bottom , actually actually care the effect of basic neurosurgeor .
So how how is a baby ?
It &apos;s like in love , in Paris , for the first time , then they get out 3 you .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s wonderful , but it &apos;s wonderful , but that we used to look at 3 at the morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s a lot of adult .
I don &apos;t mean about the time about the magnetic babies .
It &apos;s a lot of adult .
We can do things like bed in the shoes or crossing visually impaired .
And there &apos;s a sense that we &apos;ve gotten a lot of effort in doing that babies like the adults .
But if we want is that we want to be like these ballpark , to have the water open to the learning , imagination , creativity , innovation — maybe , in the most of times , we needed to do that adults think of a little

These are objects , simple , exposed , slowly , I call them , I found out , we found out , we found out , we found out , we found out , we found out , we found out , we found out , we found
These things that the victims of genocide in the time .
We all are allowing these objects around us and put you .
And the fact that some victims have been taking objects like it , or the point of teeth is a signal that we didn &apos;t have this idea that he was suffering from the one of them .
And they used to tell you that they were interfere .
And these few objects has been able to focus at a combat of my land on my land , and it &apos;s going to rehuman human human , and it &apos;s going to be a bodies of the new little bit that if they find 20 years after
And it &apos;s maybe the largest discovered .
For the four years of the conflict of the conflict of the 1990s , a few 30,000 citizens , all of the most one , based on the most 100,000 citizens were released during the operations of combat .
The more remarkable days , well in the first days of war , or well towards the end of the conflict of the top of the heart of the hands of being biof .
So the Fryl international dilates of crime against humanity and genocide .
Naudio is the destruction and criminating a group of bumps , political , dualful and crank and crank .
The region is so much aside .
As the destruction of the data , of the oil , in the middle , the cultural , and basically for any signal of his existence .
The genocide is not just aside ; it &apos;s the wind of the identity of our identity .
There &apos;s always set tors , there &apos;s no weight per .
They have been always refined of the chemistry , which his bodies would be able to use it , and you have to take a memory and mobial memory and mobile memory .
So these few objects about a lot of a lot of high compounds , and the goal of us is a single process of objects that were based on in Europe from Europe from the Hubble .
No body should be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
A time were all these objects that the victims would take up to his execution of their execution will fall and soul them to improve and soul them to improve and soul them to improve and soul them to improve and soul them to improve and
Tallows them from them , it &apos;s a high park in the park like you that you see in CSA &apos;s parks .
And this is going to be able to do that we are based on , but it also kind of tests in the end of wars , but it also kind of tests in the end of the war .
Sometimes it &apos;s called you &apos;re allowing you to identify the physical , but the non-visual medicine is a hard to be hard to below .
A time that tells us , doctors and lawyers getting up with them come to it .
And so many people , but they don &apos;t use it out of the view of the vision and the mind of it .
There &apos;s a few years ago , I decided to focus up to create a simple easy to create a visual simple eye than all of them are crank .
So I want to move the sensor .
And in this case , I &apos;ve shown you can recognize the objects and the photos that the photos are like to get , narrow and immortality of what happened .
That picture is empathy and familiar , of these objects came to us that .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , you want to , if you want , and the result is the most kind of possible to an of the design of the design , and the result , it is the most kind of possible to one
When if you treat the time to be able to get their films , and these things would be able to get objects on the body , and these things are going on .
And then their painer that &apos;s the Turing test for the Turing test for the last , to remember that these people exist .
Thank you .

There &apos;s a few years ago , I decided to follow the footprints of the big philosopher of the American philosopher , MAmymy , and I &apos;ve decided to use the footprints of the big philosopher of the United States .
There are a few things I &apos;ve learned with this soil of 30 days .
And the months ago , they &apos;re not going to show you , linnets , if the time was much more useful .
So that &apos;s a lot of my sense of taking a picture all the days of a month .
So I would never have feel as a proxy .
I also understood that .
Well , the secret &apos;s the secret in the top of the top .
But let &apos;s take a lot of a lot .
It &apos;s great .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m a bunch of computer . &quot;
I don &apos;t . If I want to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m written . &quot;
I &apos;ve done that to make the little change , and suspicates , is more likely to do it .
In fact , they &apos;re very fun .

I &apos;m here to share with my picture &apos;s photograph .
So that &apos;s photograph ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t pick with their cameras .
However , my interest started when I went to my first camera for 15 years ago .
They go back with my own passion before the ice , but it was a little bit different , because they will use the camera of the process was more well in a piece of .
And when you take a photograph with a photograph , the process is when it comes to the barrier .
So to me the photograph he was more than going to be in place in the garden , at the time .
So what you could do .
And so I wanted to create something different , something where the process is going to make the barrier .
So what &apos;s like this : a construction of a very close concert .
But it &apos;s an unbelievable mate .
And despite fact , it &apos;s keeping a real level of real level .
Or photos like these — dark , dark and collagen , but all the target of the common level of realism .
When I tell you real real photo .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can be captured but I always do it was captured on some way as a photograph .
So what &apos;s what you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick .
So that &apos;s more more than you to see with a idea that with a really close time .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes the real thing ?
Should you see with the details or with them ?
Do you have with the light ?
What does the name does ?
As a point of perspective is that illusion .
But to the end is the end of our own way to interpret the world and how it can be below in a English-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s actually not about if it &apos;s real , which is that it &apos;s real .
And so I think the foundations are very simple .
And I see the way , the reality of the reality we take different bits of reality and we together to create an alternative reality .
So let me show you a simple example .
So here we have three objects to be imagining imaginations , something that we all will stop with live in a three-dimensional world .
But by the way that we create something that we &apos;re still in three-dimensional ; as they can be there .
But , at the same time , we know that you can &apos;t exist .
So we &apos;ve been able to our brain because the brain &apos;s just wrong in the fact that really doesn &apos;t have a sense .
And I see the same process to the same process of combining photos .
It really consists of combining are different .
So the things that make a photograph really picture , I think they &apos;re not all these in what we don &apos;t even do ; things they will be surrounding in our entire life .
But when we take pictures , it &apos;s really important to be able to be doing this . Because it &apos;s very hard a little bit of some ways .
And so I &apos;d like to say that there &apos;s three main approaches that can continue to follow the real results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But then we can create something like this .
So the first gift is that the pictures of these pictures have to have the same perspective .
Second , the pictures of them have to have the same kind of light .
And these two images are going to get out of these opens ; they were took the same point and with the same kind of light .
The third point is to make impossible power where they start and shine different images with a lot .
It has to be impossible to say that he turned into the reality .
We have to put it into the color , the contrast , and the British methods , you &apos;re going to use that there &apos;s between the different images , and we have been thinking about the boundaries between all different images , and we do that
This is another example .
( Laughter ) I could think this is the picture of a landscape , and the part is what was called the end .
But this picture is there , there &apos;s no combats for different places .
I think it &apos;s more easy to create a place that can find a place that you can find , because it &apos;s not necessary to have the ideas that has in your head .
But this requires a lot of platform .
And as I thought this idea in the winter , I knew it had a lot of months to platform it , to find these different places for the red disaster .
For example , the fish was captured on one out of catch .
The back back differently .
And the top of it was captured on over one takes off .
And yeah , even for the house of the top of the island of the island of the island that can be able more .
So to take a result , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s failing .
She is always starting with a good blind , one idea .
And then there &apos;s out of these different pictures .
And there &apos;s a very nice point of it .
If you do a good good job to take the result it can be very beautiful and again .
All of the tools are there , and the only thing that we will limit is our imagination .
Thank you .

In this slide , they have to look at his age in the horizarre .
After that a set of a map , you go away .
It &apos;s a technique that we &apos;re used in the world we &apos;re using into the world .
And the distribution of the Japanese is entirely different .
They change our consequence of it works , and it has been done .
We had to make a group of control .
But we asked up that a piece of paper .
And another group that has just been exhibited a audio .
What you see here is the whole result of the audio .
It has 6 6 months .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So , we collaborate the different areas of the brain — what they do that one area like one of them .
