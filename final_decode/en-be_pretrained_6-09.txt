But the first time that we have been able to be able to take a society that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
So they &apos;re going to be about what they &apos;re doing .
Now , this is a great idea , but I think , is that , in the fact that I think is .
This is what I &apos;m going to be about , and the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> on the bathroom .
You &apos;ve spent their family to family , and the <unk> of the <unk> that was translated into him by him .
( Laughter ) That was the first time .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . I &apos;m going to get my hand in the <unk> .
And then I &apos;ve been to see how to my mind , and my family , and my family , and my family was <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> that was the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that was the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that was the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that was the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that was the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that was the <unk> of the <unk> of the
There &apos;s a little story .
Now let &apos;s take a couple of <unk> on the <unk> .
We &apos;ve gone down for <unk> .
The bottom of <unk> <unk> are <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you &apos;re talking about about their parents or <unk> and <unk> , in the <unk> , you &apos;ve been a few <unk> , or a few of <unk> , or a few of <unk> , or a few of <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> of a few or a few or a <unk> , or a <unk> of a few or a <unk> , or a <unk> of a few or a <unk> , or a <unk> of a few , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or
But today , we &apos;re able to <unk> the cost of the puzzle that will be in the <unk> of how much of our balance .
And I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> of learning .
For example , I <unk> , and I &apos;m not <unk> , because I &apos;d like to <unk> the <unk> of all of the <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;d like to see the <unk> of all of the <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;d like to see the <unk> of what I &apos;m going to do .
We &apos;re able to see some data that we have to believe that is that we have to be able to <unk> our children in our children .
One time one one of them , there was a <unk> , <unk> to me in <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
( <unk> ) <unk> : <unk> .
Audience : Wow ?
Audience : Yeah .
<unk> : <unk> can <unk> you in the United States , even in <unk> , even in <unk> .
What does it ?
<unk> : <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; when I did .
( Laughter ) <unk> : <unk> , or not ?
This is a natural <unk> , and we need to build a little bit of a little bit of compassion .
EV : <unk> of my <unk> <unk> .
It turns out to online and <unk> and <unk> that <unk> and <unk> that they can &apos;t get the same time .
But there &apos;s what we did .
Many of you , who is about <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> that he would be <unk> more than he <unk> over more than he <unk> over more than he <unk> over more than he <unk> over more than he <unk> more than a <unk> more than the <unk> of a <unk> more than he <unk> over more than he <unk> over more than the <unk> of a <unk> more than he <unk> over more than he <unk> over more than the <unk> of a <unk> more than he <unk> over more than he <unk> more
I think , with the <unk> of the device to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And I think it &apos;s really important , for that , for the first time , I think it &apos;s the best <unk> of the world that we &apos;ve created .
Now we &apos;ve created a knee .
There &apos;s most part of the question is , &quot; &quot; <unk> , he <unk> all of them , and it &apos;s what you could do you .
So , as you can see , that can be <unk> .
Now , as you know , if you &apos;re going to be able to look at the same five years ago .
A few years later , a group of <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of people who are <unk> .
And if you could see <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , that bees in the Internet .
<unk> , in the U.S. in the U.S. in the United States , in the U.S. in the U.S. , in the U.S. in the U.S. in the U.S. in the U.S. in the U.S. in the U.S. in the U.S. , in the U.S.
And if we could <unk> this technology in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
I think that &apos;s a lot of <unk> , the <unk> of us , so much more <unk> and <unk> more than the <unk> of us in <unk> <unk> .
Well , I think , we think we &apos;re all of all of us , whether if we want to do this ?
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You &apos;ve been <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
So let &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> .
So <unk> , from the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
And we don &apos;t want to do about the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
Unfortunately , the answer is the questions of the questions .
But there &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
Now , as you want to say that you want to be able to learn .
And then we have to do it , and they can do .
And what we have in <unk> , we need to be a <unk> of the universe .
These are the best <unk> of autism was in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The amazing thing that these system are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What &apos;s what we learned about education ?
Now , as a <unk> , even <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
And you know what they &apos;re going to do something that is that we &apos;re going to do something that &apos;s what we do it .
The answer is this system .
<unk> behavior , they didn &apos;t get out of their parts .
All in the 2000s , the <unk> of <unk> .
But why should not be <unk> ?
College premium ?
We &apos;re looking for <unk> .
<unk> <unk> has a <unk> percent of <unk> .
The bone is <unk> <unk> .
Now , you can see that there was no theory of autism .
How they do they operate ?
Well , <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s all of what we &apos;re going to live in more than a <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s <unk> with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
But in the United States , Brasilia is <unk> .
It &apos;s the number of productivity <unk> .
But they <unk> it percent of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
But there is the best question about what we &apos;re going ?
So what we want to do here as we need to do it .
The bone is cracked .
So , the same thing is , he &apos;s a <unk> of a tool for a few weeks , a few weeks of a few weeks at a few weeks of a few weeks at a few weeks of a few weeks at a few weeks of a few weeks at a few weeks of a few weeks at a few weeks of a few weeks at a few weeks of a few weeks at a few weeks of a few weeks at a few weeks of a few weeks at a few weeks of a few weeks at
So these genes are activated mainly by <unk> .
We &apos;ve gone through the same thing .
And it turns out , it turns out of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I want to think about what we want to talk about the same thing is that we want to be about <unk> .
And that &apos;s really <unk> when we want to talk about this .
I don &apos;t know about you , I don &apos;t know about you , but if you look at this book , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s true , because it is not <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> and <unk> .
It is something that &apos;s what happens to us from our values .
And I also search for how many things can &apos;t be able to work , and I also lost my life , I &apos;m going to change .
And you can say , and I wanted to be <unk> that a lot of <unk> that we &apos;re going to be able to take a lot of them , but even most of them are shared .
So in the 1990s , we <unk> .
He <unk> .
He <unk> .
We &apos;re in <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> from <unk> .
It &apos;s largely true , and it &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
<unk> to the machine <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
So , our <unk> are <unk> to each other trees .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s true .
And they found us like <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
All of them , I get the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Now , in one of the <unk> has <unk> the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> , in the <unk> of God <unk> .
( Laughter ) So we &apos;re going to get the word to the word &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
Anyone ?
So how happened ?
How are we <unk> to <unk> different places with our <unk> ?
And here &apos;s why we don &apos;t want to talk about the real world as we look at the right ?
It &apos;s not true , but we have a few weeks , but we have a few <unk> .
And to see that , I want to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> as a status <unk> .
When I first first , I went back to the <unk> , and I was going to <unk> those <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> these stuff .
In the way of <unk> <unk> which are <unk> for the <unk> .
Here &apos;s a couple of space .
The morning : &quot; &quot; <unk> — it &apos;s just a small <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> me , &quot; &quot; <unk> on me , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; to me , &quot; &quot; the <unk> of <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
This is the <unk> of five years , and it was very much good , for the last year .
It was in the first year , a few years ago , because for me that they &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Well , I remember one time .
So I went back back in a book , and I <unk> my <unk> , and I am my <unk> , and I &apos;m like my <unk> out of the right .
It turns out that was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and when we look at our <unk> , and when we look at our brains , and when we asked them in our lives .
I don &apos;t remember remember that I don &apos;t know what I was able to see it <unk> .
I was angry , it was the first my <unk> in the <unk> , and I was one one of the <unk> .
My friend became <unk> to my <unk> home , and I knew it <unk> , and the <unk> that I needed to have to be able to be <unk> , and the <unk> that I have to have to be able to be <unk> , and the <unk> that I have to have to be able to be <unk> , and the <unk> that I have to have to be able to be <unk> , and the <unk> that I have to have to be able to be <unk> , and the <unk> that I needed to have to
I didn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and I didn &apos;t know it .
I had been <unk> <unk> , but I <unk> .
I just just there there , and I was there there , and I just just there there .
They were <unk> .
But there &apos;s a lot of my <unk> , a few hours of <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . It was <unk> .
I really really <unk> <unk> of the <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I think it &apos;s going to <unk> this book .
Now , it &apos;s really good for me to do it , but in <unk> , I was <unk> <unk> , and I thought that it was a <unk> <unk> , and that moment , I was <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and I thought that it was a <unk> <unk> , and that moment , I was <unk> , and I thought that it was a <unk> <unk> , and that moment , I was <unk> , and I thought that it was a <unk> <unk> , and that moment , I was <unk> , and it
And I think I think that I would be <unk> , I think it &apos;s a <unk> , because I thought it &apos;s so happy .
And this is really not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
We &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s the best <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have all the first time that I have been going to get like a kid .
But if you want to look like this is like a <unk> of <unk> — not only one of me or it or it .
But I think that this is actually not smooth .
Most of us think it &apos;s a little bit <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
In fact , there is a lot of <unk> that that is <unk> , because the <unk> of <unk> , and they didn &apos;t do it .
It &apos;s really true .
This is the <unk> of blood <unk> to <unk> their <unk> of their <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of people in the <unk> .
( Laughter ) Right , and the same <unk> has been a <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
So there are a few weeks , <unk> miles of our <unk> and <unk> .
And the other thing is that most people do in this way .
The <unk> who had been been the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that would be like <unk> in the <unk> of you .
And most of us , it &apos;s like that for the first time .
<unk> from the past of a few months to a few years .
When I came from my house from my house at a <unk> , I &apos;ve been a lot of my grandfather in my <unk> , and I &apos;ve been a lot of my job in my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And I decided to tell my friends when my friends don &apos;t need to be able to <unk> them .
So I went from <unk> with them .
And it was really good for the year in my life .
But I think I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , because if I was <unk> , I would be able to see how I was <unk> .
And when I could tell you , we need to go , we would go into all of ourselves .
It &apos;s the idea of course , because it &apos;s not the idea that the way that we learned , and we want to talk about the same thing .
They are the residue of <unk> and <unk> .
Our job to say , &quot; &quot; Where &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , and she said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , and she said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , and she said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , and she said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , and she said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , and she said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , and she said , &quot;
In fact , you know what is — about the <unk> , you know what I was going to be about a <unk> when I was <unk> .
( Laughter ) So we have the <unk> of <unk> to be <unk> and <unk> that &apos;s going to <unk> .
Now , we don &apos;t have to tell you about it , and it &apos;s a crowd .
It &apos;s a little bit like <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and we &apos;re <unk> , and we &apos;re going to do it in our <unk> , and we &apos;re going to do it in our <unk> and <unk> .
The good thing is that all in the culture of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s as we want to do you , and we want to do it , and we want to take it all .
It &apos;s <unk> .
( Laughter ) To think it &apos;s a <unk> , we need to change our culture of our culture , our <unk> or our <unk> .
Imagine that we all were less cutting in <unk> .
If we were more likely to pay more more than a new <unk> , more than it in his <unk> .
I know that it &apos;s a lot of people , but I &apos;m not the first person that this is .
And in the book , the <unk> that we live in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re like , and even we can do how we &apos;re like <unk> , like <unk> that <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> plants for new <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s very much more <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> say that they &apos;re called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and we have the most <unk> of all of the <unk> , or we have the best <unk> of all of the <unk> , or we have the most <unk> of all of the <unk> , or we have the most <unk> of all of the <unk> , or we have the most <unk> of all of the <unk> , or we have the most <unk> of all of the <unk> , or we have the most <unk> of all of the <unk> ,
<unk> and <unk> , they &apos;re talking about what the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
And these ideas are <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> relationships , but they also believe and in the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
So if you &apos;re going to get the <unk> of the cost of the side of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , wrote <unk> <unk> , <unk> miles of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And she was like , &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> .
Now , here are different .
When I was <unk> , no , never thought that I would never never don &apos;t know what I would don &apos;t even know what I would never never know .
If the first time was the first time , the <unk> of the first time , she was no <unk> , but she wasn &apos;t <unk> , she was <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
Anyone ?
She &apos;d like <unk> .
Right ?
And like <unk> , we &apos;ve been <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He turns out , he <unk> his <unk> with the <unk> .
I know , the <unk> of the LHC <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but when I came to <unk> this book , and when I came to <unk> this book , and when I came to <unk> this book , and when I came to <unk> this book , and when I came to <unk> this book , and when I came to <unk> this book , and when I came to <unk> this book , and when I came to <unk> this book , and when I came to <unk> this book , and when I
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think I was that I &apos;m going to do that I &apos;m going to get out of my head , and not what I was doing .
But that &apos;s all true .
A few days later , a <unk> and <unk> , and when I feel like , I have to tell you , and I want to tell you : I want to do .
It &apos;s also <unk> .
But it &apos;s really better better than the best <unk> in which is a small <unk> .
This is a dangerous or <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
Instead of that , she &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , if you can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s really boring .
Because you want to think about it , and it &apos;s <unk> or there , and I want to think you do it .
A few years ago , we have to say that <unk> , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t do this .
Or , &quot; &quot; And these relationships were things , but it was <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
Five years later , as we &apos;re going to be ?
Thank you .
( Applause )
One of my <unk> , I &apos;ve been <unk> to the house from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
You know , like it , if you &apos;re going to <unk> , if you &apos;re not going to <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
You &apos;ve been in <unk> ( <unk> ) I &apos;d like my <unk> and the <unk> of me that I have been going to do this .
And what is that thing is , so much <unk> <unk> ?
It &apos;s face on <unk> .
The <unk> that <unk> in the culture of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) Now , I &apos;m going to know , and the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , and she was <unk> , and she was <unk> , and she was <unk> , and she was <unk> , and she was <unk> , and she was <unk> , and she was <unk> , and she was <unk> .
Because that I was .
( Laughter ) So he &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> for the <unk> . ( Laughter )
In the past five years , I &apos;ve been a lot of all of this , and we &apos;ve been doing that we &apos;re going to be about human .
And <unk> , I &apos;ve been the only five years in the <unk> of <unk> .
And I have to find you so much of you can <unk> , but in the way of <unk> : <unk> <unk> on the place .
( Laughter ) We have one of us from the <unk> of <unk> from <unk> from <unk> , or if you don &apos;t want to think about it .
And we know it .
We understand that , in fact , everything in this room .
Well , we <unk> , we &apos;re going to get <unk> .
But if if you want to me , in this moment , in the moment of <unk> , in the time that I couldn &apos;t imagine that I can &apos;t see that <unk> .
And what happens is , what happens we live in this time .
And at them , we <unk> on a <unk> , in them , at them on the <unk> , in the <unk> and the voice .
It &apos;s clear that we &apos;ve all <unk> in life in the <unk> that we have all need .
That &apos;s me going to be <unk> .
It is the problem as the problem is how much of us , and the same is as much as a society .
And what I want to do today is a <unk> because we &apos;re looking at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Secondly , it &apos;s really important to <unk> .
And I want you to tell you today , and if you don &apos;t know , it is that one of those <unk> in <unk> , and that you can do .
So why is we <unk> in <unk> ?
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> .
If you can see , because you &apos;re like , because you don &apos;t want ?
<unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> , with the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , all of the <unk> of <unk> , all of the <unk> , they &apos;re going to be <unk> , but they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
You &apos;re going to say a question : Well , what you &apos;re not <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk>
( Laughter ) So the <unk> <unk> is <unk> to the clinic like <unk> , and we &apos;ve been <unk> , not ?
For example , can be <unk> , or <unk> , or even <unk> <unk> , or even <unk> <unk> , even like my <unk> <unk> .
But for the side , I <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , here &apos;s <unk> .
You see a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but they didn &apos;t <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
It turns out in this room in this room , which is that <unk> in <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> , because the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
But every time has been <unk> in <unk> now over the <unk> .
And what happens when you just only five years , what you &apos;ve been made that for the last year , is that for the last year , and it &apos;s what for it is also .
And then we saw something more than not <unk> <unk> and don &apos;t expect that <unk> in <unk> .
That &apos;s the first time .
And if we don &apos;t want to be ?
So , we &apos;ve been <unk> , we &apos;ve got to do that , but we know , we &apos;re still going to get out of the ground .
I have to tell you what I was <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) So this is that we <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of our <unk> .
I &apos;m going to do it .
In fact , we don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> that would be <unk> when we &apos;re not <unk> .
There &apos;s a second thing , so we <unk> to do that , it &apos;s more <unk> to the culture .
Imagine your own school .
You &apos;d like a <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , that &apos;s not my confession .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s what you &apos;re going to get the book and you know what about the same time .
And he &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , he didn &apos;t expect .
So , as the time to <unk> , you &apos;ve learned that the <unk> of the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> , and all of the same way to be <unk> , and then , as you can do it in life .
So we <unk> these tools are good .
Most of us , and as I think , especially in this way , especially in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Or don &apos;t be <unk> to <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> ?
( Laughter ) And how do we all all of this is <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
There is no lot .
And then we &apos;ve been <unk> when we found that we &apos;re in , you &apos;re in , you &apos;re in .
Because ladies in this point , when we look at the same thing if we &apos;re going to do that .
So we <unk> them , because we &apos;re going to do it , because we &apos;re going to change your <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Let me give you an example .
A few years ago , in the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> was a good framework for <unk> .
This is a great point in the <unk> .
This is a <unk> of space from <unk> and <unk> , he &apos;s one of the <unk> in <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
It was called <unk> under the <unk> of his <unk> , and he <unk> her <unk> and her <unk> in the <unk> .
Well , the <unk> was <unk> .
And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to look at the <unk> of her <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t look at her <unk> , because they didn &apos;t look at her <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> .
If you want to take this education for the <unk> of <unk> , he said , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
Now , in the <unk> of <unk> , I &apos;ve been <unk> for <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which is all of the things we all have in the world , and as the <unk> of what happens in the world in the world .
And when we look at the side of those <unk> just in the <unk> and even we know , we don &apos;t want to be able to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the problem for your brain .
But this is a problem for society .
The <unk> is that they didn &apos;t pay their <unk> .
It means that you &apos;re <unk> <unk> your reality .
And in the way , the problem is the problem is the problem that you have to share with you .
The third thing is that one of us are much for much of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first thing we &apos;re really , if we don &apos;t do if we &apos;re not <unk> in the questions that they &apos;re not <unk> in the questions .
Now , I don &apos;t have the most important part of what we have in you , and if you &apos;re going to do that with them , and if you &apos;re going to do that with them , and they &apos;re going to do it .
If it doesn &apos;t be if we &apos;re going to do , if we &apos;re going to do with us , but we &apos;re not <unk> , we <unk> that they &apos;re not <unk> , we would be <unk> .
( Laughter ) Now , they all have two <unk> , and they &apos;re not doing it .
And if you don &apos;t see that when we &apos;re talking that people don &apos;t want to be able to <unk> , all of us are not going to be <unk> , but for their <unk> , we know , but for the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that we know is , but for their <unk> , we know it , but for the <unk> of the <unk> that we know is , but for their <unk> , we know it , but for the <unk> of the <unk> that we know is , but for
That &apos;s the <unk> .
For example , they don &apos;t have to be able to <unk> their <unk> , especially when we &apos;re going to be to each other .
And what happens to me , I think is that I think that is a <unk> of us , and I think that &apos;s a <unk> of our human future .
It &apos;s like , we want to suggest that our minds is the best <unk> , the world we can <unk> them in the world .
And we want to take the future of the future , and it &apos;s what the same thing is .
It &apos;s a <unk> , and if you were , there was the world was <unk> .
So our brains are not to be that we can see the world we have .
It turns out that we can see the world we have .
We can <unk> this stuff about the future , and we can look at how we can be able to look like , we can look at here .
So it &apos;s because there &apos;s what we &apos;re wearing here , we can &apos;t look at the same piece of <unk> and see it , and it &apos;s .
And so we &apos;re talking .
In the past year , the <unk> year , the <unk> of his <unk> <unk> , and I think of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the
And I realized that I had to <unk> — that &apos;s not the <unk> of the particles that is not to be able to <unk> or <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> of our <unk> .
Because we &apos;re not <unk> , we don &apos;t know what that &apos;s the world in the world .
In other parts , the <unk> we <unk> the world of the world .
I think that &apos;s a <unk> , this is a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> for the <unk> of our <unk> .
Now , in fact , I started to see a lot of <unk> , and I started to see a lot of <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And then I think , and I &apos;ve been talking about all of all the <unk> of <unk> .
And first , I thought , I was sure .
Now I always have been <unk> to see a marathon .
She &apos;d like a everywhere .
But the time came months , I had a <unk> <unk> in New York Times .
I &apos;m going to look at all of them , and he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s really true .
It turns out that they had a <unk> , and he &apos;s the best <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be like this : <unk> , and it &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do it , and it &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do it .
We need to be able to be <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of those <unk> , and we need to be able to be <unk> <unk> .
We need to be <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
What is what we learned , we need to <unk> <unk> .
But you know what is our <unk> , because our life are life .
We think that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , but actually actually do it .
He was like a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it happened .
But then , and <unk> and <unk> , who will be <unk> to the life of my life is not <unk> and <unk> , and we &apos;re able to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
And it happened .
And then you know what <unk> and <unk> and <unk> with <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> of them .
And it happened .
I have to tell you what I thought about the book about something about something that you don &apos;t have to be going to be .
And it happened .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not true .
We &apos;ve been talking about about the world , which is the <unk> of the world , is not .
And it &apos;s no , but the same thing is that we have <unk> of our farms .
And we know , we &apos;ve been <unk> for a story of <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and you know , we know , we know , we know , we know , we know ?
Because of the most important thing that we were <unk> , and we have the world to the world , in the world , which is there .
( Laughter ) Not <unk> , or not ? ( Laughter )
( Laughter ) That &apos;s my <unk> <unk> , right ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we look at listening .
And we have to be <unk> .
We &apos;ve got another idea .
We &apos;re another big challenge .
We &apos;re looking at some other <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , as you &apos;ve been <unk> for the side of the <unk> .
And I don &apos;t want to be able to want to be a <unk> of <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I <unk> . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
One of the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> machines .
Our first <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> , he <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
In fact , those numbers were <unk> <unk> .
But for example , in <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
In a result , the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> is <unk> .
I was in <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> in a family and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
But when I was <unk> years of our family , and we started <unk> .
My mother <unk> me that I had to try to see a <unk> who would be able to see , and even most of the days , in fact , even of a few seconds .
And then I realized that people are people to each other .
But in every year , in every year , in the <unk> of <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of their <unk> that they have to produce the <unk> of their <unk> .
In the past months , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> me , and I realized that a few months later , he <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> for the <unk> .
And he said that I &apos;m going to get on them .
We &apos;re going to take a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
And that day my day <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and she &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> of a <unk> .
My <unk> became <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
But all of these very very important <unk> , but only in a few years , I saw it to do it .
He was the <unk> of my eyes , and they were my <unk> .
As a result of those people who was <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It was also .
<unk> together , I <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> means &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m going to take a 75 percent of a year , and it &apos;s <unk> in my <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Every time I was going to write this book , and when I was talking about that river , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in the United States .
I always always find the people in Arabic , I &apos;m often <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be able to walk from the <unk> of <unk> to <unk> , but as a <unk> , for people in the way , for people in order to be able to live in .
They were looking at the United States .
<unk> , my <unk> was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I used to <unk> people on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> .
And what is I <unk> ?
So we &apos;ve been <unk> that <unk> the best <unk> of which happened to the most <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> after I had to use <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
My grandmother was the first of domestic violence .
We &apos;ve created the idea of our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And one day , I realized that one of my voice was <unk> .
Because it turns out a few weeks of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I never never had no idea of me , and I thought , I was like , I was that the <unk> <unk> of my life .
<unk> <unk> was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which was the <unk> of <unk> .
One people I &apos;ve been <unk> for a lot of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in my <unk> .
Because it was nothing to be a <unk> <unk> .
And as a <unk> , I was <unk> <unk> , and I didn &apos;t realize that many of the <unk> were <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to me on the <unk> of other people who I want to be <unk> to me .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what I &apos;ve been <unk> , and this is the <unk> of the early <unk> , from <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to do this is a <unk> of <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I think it &apos;s a
And then there was the <unk> of <unk> , and many of these days that <unk> me to be able to be able to be able to <unk> out of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> has to be able to be a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
In every day , he came into my mom , in which I &apos;m going to do .
Now , often often come up , you know what it &apos;s not <unk> , you know what you &apos;re going to get my <unk> more than my <unk> .
One day I was to my mother my mother , and I was my mother my mother , and she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m going to get out of my life .
She said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I <unk> people . &quot;
And in this moment , I decided to see how much of the <unk> that I was like to try to <unk> this room .
The <unk> isn &apos;t my name .
I &apos;d like a <unk> when my family was <unk> , and my family has been to change the lives .
So I went to my clinic and feel like <unk> , and I feel so happy ?
And it &apos;s just enough .
I do it in the <unk> that many of <unk> is <unk> , and I &apos;m not <unk> .
Instead of that , I <unk> our <unk> in <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
I do it for a <unk> and for them , and for them , for <unk> and <unk> and <unk> who <unk> their <unk> .
As a result , I was going to <unk> those <unk> and <unk> Academy of my parents .
And I &apos;m like <unk> how many of domestic violence were not the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> , and it &apos;s not the <unk> of his parents .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It can be about what we can be able to be able to be <unk> .
And there &apos;s no more likely to do it .
It can help you help to make a little bit like <unk> .
When I was <unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> , and then I was <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s my <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of my <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of my <unk> in the <unk> of my <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> and <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
It turns out , because they &apos;re not there .
So , I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m going to be about <unk> to be able to be <unk> .
Now , we can &apos;t .
If there &apos;s a little bit of stress , but it really thought that would be thought , but it would be done .
<unk> to family , and so forth .
<unk> , they &apos;re going to be able to <unk> you to see the <unk> of you .
We have a <unk> perspective , we have a <unk> perspective .
If you can look at the <unk> , you &apos;re at <unk> , you &apos;re looking at the <unk> , you &apos;re looking at the <unk> .
And you &apos;ve done a lot to know , and that &apos;s a whole idea for stress .
And it turns out , or we &apos;re doing here , or we do it .
I made that who was scared .
And when we &apos;re able to take a little bit like this , and if we &apos;re able to test for ourselves .
And that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do this way .
A few years ago , and I decided to go back to the garden , and I decided to <unk> my <unk> , and I decided to <unk> my <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> those &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> isn &apos;t <unk> , for the more <unk> months .
This is one of my brother , when I was going to look at all the day day .
I never never <unk> this stuff .
And I also <unk> , and I also <unk> .
In fact , the world is not <unk> to bed , and the education is not <unk> to bed .
It &apos;s also about their own age .
She <unk> .
And I don &apos;t have to tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have an expert in <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , when I can say , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t . &quot;
I realized that if I was going to get a <unk> <unk> , and I realized that they were <unk> on my <unk> .
In fact , they <unk> .
( Applause )
I was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the world that <unk> the world to be <unk> .
In fact , when I was five years old , women in <unk> <unk> .
And that day , they didn &apos;t expect , but it &apos;s a <unk> place , or <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> in the New York <unk> <unk> — the <unk> of <unk> percent of women and <unk> and <unk> to talk about <unk> .
<unk> don &apos;t look at that day , because there &apos;s no idea that there has no .
( Applause ) <unk> years ago , a year had a <unk> <unk> in the world that was <unk> <unk> in the world that was <unk> <unk> in the world .
I never never heard that day , when I got to <unk> my book , and when I got to home on my home , and I never got to <unk> my home from my home , and then she &apos;s <unk> .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) It was a good for <unk> for me , and for you know , who was at the same time for me .
It &apos;s often about about <unk> <unk> that <unk> to her <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , we can be able to be a <unk> of this guy ?
In fact , I could be <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> , <unk> in the U.S. in <unk> , which is that <unk> percent of the percent of <unk> <unk> , but it was five percent .
We &apos;re going to <unk> percent percent percent , and it &apos;s the idea that it has been done .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , because I thought that there would be <unk> and more carbon to them .
Now , my whole team of the <unk> who I have to do that I would have to have a <unk> <unk> , even though we want .
This is the idea of my life .
It was no .
<unk> from a couple of <unk> <unk> .
And then I went to the <unk> of my <unk> , and I went to <unk> to us , I &apos;ve been <unk> .
( Applause ) But it &apos;s still not the way to the <unk> .
And it turns out that there are in the United States , but I can say — ( Laughter ) I can tell you .
In fact , the <unk> of the last year , the <unk> of a few years , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , it , and <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And then he <unk> , when our <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> in <unk> , they were <unk> , and it was a family .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> of the <unk> that we need a <unk> <unk> .
And a few days later , a few days with his family and her family , and he began to <unk> <unk> .
In fact , it &apos;s <unk> , he <unk> it because because of the two numbers , because of the two <unk> of autism can be <unk> to <unk> .
So later , nine years later , I &apos;m not good .
I don &apos;t have a <unk> place in <unk> .
The <unk> , I was in one percent , but all of them , it was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
What I had to say , I had to <unk> all of the <unk> of the <unk> , because the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the first <unk> .
In the day of these numbers , I can &apos;t see there , and that I can &apos;t there , and that I can &apos;t see that <unk> <unk> in the first time .
( Applause ) And the same thing .
The second thing is that I had to find that with a couple of <unk> , and that &apos;s a little bit from a collection of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> with us .
Some example became <unk> a <unk> for a <unk> and <unk> .
She can &apos;t do .
I was walking out of it , and then we <unk> them in the Internet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of a few months later , in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
And I don &apos;t mean that I &apos;m going to do it .
Now , I want to tell you the <unk> of the <unk> , because in the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> that we want to do .
If I was born there , the first question is , &quot; &quot; You are the <unk> of <unk> ? &quot;
Now , from the percent of the percent of the percent of it will be useful .
But the fact that I have been , and the time that I was in <unk> , and I know , and I know , and I don &apos;t want to be about that .
I got one of the <unk> <unk> never never been before .
When I was legally <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , which is all the same thing , and the <unk> of them .
I decided to do that , but I &apos;m going to get a restaurant .
I had no idea of my <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
( Applause ) So let &apos;s be <unk> .
But there &apos;s another very important different .
I was like <unk> as <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
This is a lot of education and the majority of bees , especially to <unk> our culture , but also the <unk> of our brain , but also the same thing is better .
It was the <unk> , and we see , and I think it &apos;s a lot of other other .
That &apos;s the same thing <unk> , because I wanted to tell you a <unk> of the <unk> .
If we were at a dangerous numbers , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> of the soil .
I &apos;m going to <unk> in the ground , and everything else is <unk> <unk> questions .
All of the questions that we were at the <unk> of the soil , because we &apos;ve been in the <unk> of the soil , because we went to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
When I went out of the advice that I started to follow myself .
And I looked like this , and I live in the New York <unk> that I &apos;ve been able to see <unk> in the <unk> of my grandmother .
I could have a lot of <unk> and <unk> , because there was I <unk> .
But then , for that , in fact , we &apos;ve had the <unk> of <unk> from the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s a lot of <unk> and it .
Sadly , I &apos;m talking about <unk> and not <unk> about money .
The <unk> thing is that it &apos;s true , but it is true , and we were less likely to do others in the United States .
So , the reason thing is , the reason thing is that I was going to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
And yet , I &apos;m going to do a lot of <unk> <unk> .
Some example , it &apos;s <unk> .
But even with the <unk> and <unk> , and she &apos;s only one of the <unk> and <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been doing it as you can see a little forest .
( Laughter ) <unk> over the data , I was <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) Well , I &apos;m not <unk> to <unk> , because I &apos;m not <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> of the place , and we &apos;ve been <unk> the same time and we &apos;ve been <unk> the same time and we <unk> the same time , we &apos;ve been <unk> the <unk> of the planet , and we &apos;ve been <unk> the same time and we &apos;ve been <unk> the same time and we <unk> the same time , we <unk> the <unk> of the planet , and we &apos;ve been <unk> the same time
A lot of that may have a <unk> <unk> , and a lot of people have been <unk> again .
But at fact , I was really <unk> <unk> <unk> that I was <unk> more than a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of people in the <unk> .
( Applause ) It &apos;s not a <unk> , and she never never had to <unk> .
But the day of the book , I gave her <unk> , she was <unk> , she was <unk> and <unk> my mother .
Well , that was the <unk> of my artwork .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
They &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> on <unk> and <unk> his <unk> and <unk> it .
Audience : Wow !
This is for me for me .
We can see what else else .
My <unk> and <unk> .
( Applause ) <unk> in the last decade , and the time , women are going to be <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
I was also <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and many of the <unk> that we &apos;re just on the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> that
( Applause ) And we need to do it all .
In the past time , we <unk> it , because we &apos;ve been doing .
The rest of this work is to work .
It just just just to the end of this , and you know , how you want to work , and you &apos;re going to work , and you want to talk about , if you don &apos;t want to go with , if you don &apos;t want to go with you .
And so I &apos;m going to tell you how many of this is , and I &apos;m going to do that this is more than that I can do you .
But it , it is <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> , I &apos;ve been <unk> .
The <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> to <unk> , and I &apos;m going to try to the garden of the <unk> , and I realized that one of the <unk> of the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to try to each one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
How on my mind is a <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t you .
Now , I also also <unk> , and all all of you , in the way , the question is a team .
People are <unk> and <unk> your experience of <unk> and <unk> , but it &apos;s in .
For me , this is a <unk> of <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of people who
And I think the most of the pyramid , the world says , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , I think I would be <unk> , when I was <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m an instant , because of course , it turns out , and they &apos;re going to get on the <unk> .
But one day , I decided to tell you what he <unk> .
It &apos;s not to be that , because I really really really really <unk> <unk> , because people are really <unk> to me .
We don &apos;t want to be a lot of a lot that will be <unk> on your head .
And so I think that &apos;s really important two : <unk> people , so much of the two <unk> : <unk> of you , but not less <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of you , but not less <unk> and <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve got one of that , and I was not to try to try to go back to the <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to get at all the same time .
When I went to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> , and that was the time that I was going to get out of my kids , and they didn &apos;t even see it .
I was <unk> by the soil , where the transformation of <unk> means of course
The first of them , &quot; &quot; I <unk> , &quot; &quot; I wanted to be <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> of our <unk> .
The first word is <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And I went to <unk> this company .
In fact , it was a lot of a lot , but there was a lot of purpose .
And I &apos;ve got one of a sense of <unk> in this other .
The word says , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was <unk> for all the side .
I had no idea about it , and there &apos;s no idea there there was there in our head or or our <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m like , <unk> , you &apos;re going to get out of the questions .
Now , the number of the word is the most important thing that we have to be <unk> , we <unk> the culture of the <unk> of the <unk> .
( Laughter ) So I thought that I was confident that I would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> , but they &apos;re going to take the same time .
And I can say that I was just just , but I think , and I think , is my team , it was it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not <unk> to show up an <unk> : <unk> <unk> — PM : I &apos;m not <unk> .
And it turns out , in this point is , maybe you know , in the <unk> and <unk> of you .
We &apos;re doing there , we can &apos;t see that we can <unk> in the <unk> , but there &apos;s something something that we can <unk> in the <unk> , like it .

In fact , I &apos;m going to think about the last time , I &apos;m going to think about the most of the room , and the example of that I &apos;m going to <unk> my home , and the most example that I &apos;m going to be a <unk> home and the way that I &apos;ve been a <unk> home and the book that I &apos;m going to <unk> my home , and the most example that I &apos;m going to be a <unk> home and the way that I &apos;ve been a <unk> home and the book
And a few days , in the book , &quot; &quot; <unk> , I want to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , I want to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , I want to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
And I &apos;m not just only in the world , but we &apos;ve had a <unk> more than one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
And we &apos;re not just a <unk> of <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , but also the <unk> of the <unk> that they were in the most important thing .
<unk> is the <unk> of human energy , and we have the world that I can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I can
There are a few weeks , who was I <unk> .
A second thing , it &apos;s a <unk> of education and <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> ,
They &apos;re going to <unk> those <unk> to <unk> <unk> with women in the <unk> of God .
A few years ago , I was <unk> , and I was a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
So they &apos;re called <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of people will be <unk> , and then you can <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , and that you can <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , and that you can have to be able to be able to <unk> , and so forth .
But interestingly , that &apos;s what <unk> is <unk> to be more aggressive than more <unk> .
This is the problem of the problem is what we can <unk> the power of women , and when the Age of the soul , the <unk> of women , and when the wind was a small <unk> of women .
So why I want to pay them , and the <unk> of <unk> ?
And the problem is the problem is the <unk> of domestic violence .
In the U.S. , like , we &apos;ve had a diversity of diversity in <unk> , in the U.S. , <unk> people were <unk> in the city .
<unk> from the <unk> of Americans in the <unk> .
Now , the number of people from each other .
It &apos;s a lot of autism .
For example , I &apos;ve been <unk> to a <unk> <unk> percent of vacant lots .
We are one of the <unk> <unk> on someone who was in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re a <unk> place in one of the most <unk> that most <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re in New York , and I was in <unk> <unk> , and I was in <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
Let &apos;s look at the <unk> .
<unk> on this book , it &apos;s only that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> to people , and <unk> to people , and the <unk> of people who are more likely to people , and the <unk> of people who are more likely to be able to talk about violence .
And I can &apos;t see a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m not <unk> , and I can &apos;t see a <unk> , and I can &apos;t see a <unk> , and I can &apos;t see a <unk> , and I can &apos;t see a <unk> , and I can &apos;t see a <unk> , and I can &apos;t see a <unk> , and I can &apos;t see a <unk> , and I can &apos;t see a <unk> , and I can
One one of them are the <unk> of <unk> .
It turns out in in every room , when you could be able to know her , but it &apos;s <unk> , they &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
Every more than a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is a little bit <unk> .
And then , when she would be out , that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , they would have to lose it .
It &apos;s not a <unk> , right ?
In a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent of the women who were in today today , they were <unk> in this way .
In fact , it &apos;s more than the percent of women who are the <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> for all those women who were in their countries .
Now , the one thing is very important , but the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , in a <unk> , even when she would be out of it or or <unk> , or even when she would be able to get out of it or or <unk> , or even when she would be able to get out of it or or <unk> , even when she would be able to get out of it or or <unk> , or even when she would be able to get out of it or or <unk> , even when she
This is the <unk> of <unk> our family .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; He <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> percent of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> percent of women .
The problem is the problem that there is in the world in women , and the women is , or <unk> to people , like this .
About eight million Americans were <unk> in the <unk> in the U.S.
30 million million Americans are today today .
The US government has been <unk> for a year , and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and many of those trees are the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of those women who are highly <unk> in the 50s .
In the United States , in this moment , there has lots of <unk> or in <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and where I <unk> in <unk> and where I <unk> in the <unk> of women and where I <unk> in the <unk> of women , and then I <unk> in the <unk> of the women , and the other women , people in the women , people in the women , people in the women , people in the women , people in the women , people in the women , people in the women , people in the women , people in the women , people in the women
It &apos;s the number one test in America .
There are a lot of data as a lot of <unk> , which is a lot of <unk> .
If you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is my <unk> they do it .
One of the 20th group of <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> in a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
This is a very important <unk> <unk> , because there &apos;s no great problem , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or
This is the best of the pyramid , women are <unk> and <unk> in the world .
There &apos;s my <unk> approach to do that .
A few years ago , we &apos;ve got to change the world , and women are more likely to be able to <unk> <unk> , and then ( Applause )
In the United States , the United States .
In one of the multiverse , the Warriors were turning the U.S.
And <unk> , I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> from the <unk> of that moment .
This is a natural <unk> , that can be daunting .
We have two dangerous S , our <unk> and <unk> the knee .
In <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> that I got to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> more than one of the <unk> , and the reason is that you want to be the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and of course , they want to do that .
It means needs to be <unk> .
Now , we have to be able to take a lot of my life , and it &apos;s a lot of people who are in <unk> <unk> , because of course , in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of domestic violence .
So &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; to <unk> <unk> because they &apos;re going to be out , but if they &apos;re going to get out of you , but when they &apos;re at the <unk> of you , but when they &apos;re going to be <unk> , but when they &apos;re at the <unk> of you , but when they &apos;re at the <unk> of you , but when they &apos;re going to be <unk> , but when they &apos;re at the <unk> of you , but when they &apos;re at the <unk>
They &apos;re not <unk> .
This is the things that need in our hearts .
It &apos;s really <unk> to be <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> how you know . ( Applause ) And this is a little bit <unk> .
When I was <unk> , the <unk> was <unk> .
So , we &apos;ve got a restaurant <unk> , and it &apos;s — ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) And the time of the last few years ago , I had only 30 years ago .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening on .
And when we &apos;re a <unk> , in the <unk> of them , and the <unk> of them , I &apos;m going to meet you , and I &apos;m going to meet you &apos;re in the same thing .
It &apos;s what happens in our <unk> .
This one one is the problem of <unk> : We &apos;re the best line on .
We &apos;re in a park in America , we World War II .
The Victorians were <unk> on the line .
<unk> together , we <unk> on the <unk> of people .
Also , of course , there are the <unk> of us .
We were in fact , we were in fact , and World War II , after World War II .
In the <unk> years , I don &apos;t have to say that we don &apos;t say — ( Applause )
But in <unk> , those things are ideas , <unk> to each other and <unk> their own <unk> , the number of domestic violence .
A one thing is one of the reasons , we &apos;ve been <unk> .
( Applause ) It is true .
It might be <unk> that you can say , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , this is very much as much as I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , when I was <unk>
The bottom of the pyramid , the Jaipur Foot between the <unk> between the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
But then , for that , for many people who didn &apos;t realize that they didn &apos;t realize that they didn &apos;t know that the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of
Even when they said , &quot; &quot; I <unk> they &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> .
But most of the system that we &apos;ve learned is to believe that we &apos;ve been created for the world , most of men who are highly <unk> .
So how do we do today ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; Do that we can do for women in the <unk> of <unk> how you could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take to go back to the <unk> of the world .
Now , I &apos;m not <unk> that I &apos;m going to do it .
But I knew I was that I was going to <unk> my <unk> , and I wanted to look at the future , and we look at the same way , we need to protect our <unk> and <unk> .
I went down <unk> , and I &apos;ve been talking about them , and I &apos;ve thought about all of them , and I know what all you have to be a <unk> of women , and I know what all you have to be a <unk> of women , and I know what all you have to be a <unk> of women , and I know what all you have to be a <unk> of women , and I know what all you have to be a <unk> of women , and I know what all you have
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
When I was <unk> at the early <unk> in the world , the world has been <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the population .
There was a <unk> was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and the <unk> of our life .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of us would be <unk> .
One of it wasn &apos;t just . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Now , I &apos;m going to give you a lot of <unk> 30 percent .
It &apos;s <unk> by two percent .
And this is a <unk> on the Internet on the <unk> .
The <unk> which is more <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ?
My <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> on the Internet .
To look at this question , you need to understand how much more <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and
In other words , you need to understand what you &apos;re going to do .
I want you to do how to do is that we &apos;ve been <unk> from the world of <unk> .
They were <unk> for 30 years .
And then , there was millions of things , but the <unk> rate in the <unk> of the United States .
It &apos;s a <unk> , but it &apos;s true .
In the time , the time is about <unk> for five years .
The Higgs field is to be a <unk> .
You can &apos;t see different from <unk> from <unk> and <unk> to <unk> .
And more importantly , the <unk> of ideas are ideas about <unk> , ideas , different <unk> .
They were <unk> together in this technology .
And this is a <unk> where I think it has to be able to tell me that I think it &apos;s the <unk> of the world &apos;s happening in the world .
The education is also about three : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
They <unk> together .
How is the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> of those numbers in the other <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve got to do a lot of .
In one of the vocabulary of <unk> <unk> , <unk> to produce the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of all of the United States .
It &apos;s not a personal note .
And what &apos;s my wish is to the end of the early <unk> <unk> ?
And I think it was — this is a <unk> , the <unk> of the universe .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not doing that .
It can &apos;t be an hour .
Maybe it .
There is no <unk> .
They &apos;re only one of the <unk> who <unk> from <unk> .
The bone is cracked .
But it &apos;s something in .
<unk> <unk> has to be able to <unk> people in the <unk> .
There &apos;s no kind of <unk> <unk> .
So , why &apos;s why let &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
The answer is from <unk> in the <unk> .
And it was a <unk> , it was like a <unk> <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> .
And then I spent three million hours and <unk> three hours .
I got tired of the hour and <unk> two hours of the <unk> .
And then the same thing is to the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
He was <unk> .
It can &apos;t help to be able to walk and <unk> .
When the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the
And for the <unk> that are different to <unk> , and so forth .
<unk> and <unk> on his clinic on its own time .
I said , how much you want to be able to know , and then I want to know , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the book .
If you were <unk> , you need to be able to go in .
How you do it ?
How much you want to go back for the next time for someone else , if you want in the book ?
At <unk> .
You &apos;ll give you a few of <unk> , <unk> .
Thank you so much 15 minutes to make the most <unk> in the United States , from others .
And you have to have able to find some six hours to make a <unk> that would be able to fit .
So back back to the <unk> and <unk> of the question , &quot; &quot; Who did them . &quot;
<unk> : <unk> was to do people .
How do it do that ?
Anyone ?
You know , I think there is a lot of .
So how to do do a <unk> for me .
And that &apos;s what a society .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re at the <unk> line .
In the past place , when you were <unk> , people on the side of you .
They were his <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , and it in the way .
<unk> people have to follow him for dinner .
But the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the Higgs field .
They &apos;re in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> and they were <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the world will be going to be <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> , the world is going to be a <unk> for their own generation for the <unk> , the world is going to be able to be <unk> for the next time . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , the world will be going to be a
( Applause ) We need to take an hour .
In fact , there &apos;s other things that bees are different .
<unk> : <unk> an example .
<unk> : <unk> Egg .
Even though we &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) And if you &apos;ve been <unk> this ?
That &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
But I don &apos;t have there .
There is a <unk> opportunity to make a food <unk> .
We &apos;ve been working for men and women .
And the same thing is that she would be <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
So this is that <unk> .
And it turns out that it doesn &apos;t need to be <unk> .
But that we have to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t mean that .
They were <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> <unk> .
But there &apos;s no idea that I was in <unk> <unk> .
There is no <unk> of women .
<unk> , women are men with men .
But we don &apos;t have any <unk> competition in America , because the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that they were always always have been to their <unk> .
For example , the <unk> of the place where were <unk> <unk> .
They always always come from <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> of people around the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
When we started <unk> <unk> , this is a <unk> <unk> that they were in the way .
<unk> ahead to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And by the <unk> of this study , the <unk> of this year , there &apos;s a few years ago , where we see that <unk> , <unk> and <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> .
But the <unk> thing is the <unk> , in the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And that &apos;s evidence that women were first .
And that &apos;s led to <unk> .
They found them with their own own <unk> , and that &apos;s some other <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s some of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And what happens when when <unk> people from the <unk> and <unk> ?
The answer is that it &apos;s not just the <unk> of being , but even there can be able to be able to <unk> .
There is an <unk> .
<unk> with people in people with <unk> , they &apos;re really <unk> .
This is the most of the United States , there was nothing enough to be <unk> to their technology .
But there isn &apos;t just on the side of <unk> — the <unk> is — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot; &quot; What happened to the <unk> <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> — &quot; &quot; <unk> — &quot;
The bottom of the pyramid , the <unk> of <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , more more than <unk> <unk> .
There was <unk> .
So back back back to the <unk> and <unk> , and that &apos;s not just that , and we know how to do it ?
Her name was an <unk> .
Right .
I &apos;m <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they didn &apos;t know how the same trees , and they didn &apos;t know how the same trees , and they didn &apos;t know how the same trees , and they didn &apos;t know how the same trees , and they didn &apos;t know how the same trees , and they didn &apos;t know how the same trees , and they didn &apos;t know how the same trees , and they didn &apos;t know how the trees
And what we did in the world , the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> — we &apos;re going to do .
This is not about what you &apos;re in .
But there &apos;s a technology technology , in the next technology , there in the next technology .
In fact , I &apos;m not <unk> to the <unk> of a <unk> , and I &apos;m not <unk> to the <unk> of a <unk> , and one of the other groups that the same thing .
It &apos;s not true .
In fact , of my matter is , how people are people going to get out of the things , and how they are not going to be as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much of
We made the tools for our honeybees .
We &apos;re just making it in <unk> .
We are <unk> this way .
One of course , the <unk> and <unk> of each other <unk> from the <unk> , in learning .
It doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s health .
In the future , we &apos;ve created a tool in which we &apos;re looking at <unk> things .
<unk> <unk> , depression .
<unk> people in the <unk> , I &apos;m sure .
But I also told people that they &apos;re <unk> people , and they &apos;re going to be able to <unk> people who would be able to be able to be able to be able to be sure .
Because it turns out to be a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> to their <unk> .
Thank you .
