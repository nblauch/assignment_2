Today , I &apos;m talking about an unbelievable discovery .
I &apos;m now working in the technology technology .
And I &apos;m a little bit of my mind , and we can &apos;t take it to the power of power .
And so , what we would do is we think about different mirrors for this .
This is a tiny video that we &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s a moment .
The solution can be a little bit of time .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re just — I &apos;m going to put this feeling — I &apos;m going to see that I &apos;m going to have a video . ( Laughter )
You . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) That &apos;s not ... ( Laughter )
OK . ( Laughter )
The solar technology ...
Oh , I was the end of it ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
I want you to give you a lot of what you &apos;re going to do .
And after a couple of minutes , we &apos;re going to go to this . I hope that if you learn to do a little bit of your body , it can change your life .
We &apos;re very interested in the language , and we &apos;re looking at the language of their heads .
The computational blueprint is going to motivate us : ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s just a bit like a danger and laugh , and it &apos;s just something that &apos;s going to make a lot of money , and it &apos;s a good thing .
The chicken : That &apos;s what they &apos;re going to get 10 percent .
This is the chance of the USS president of the United States .
The time is , you know , you know . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re going to appreciate it . We shake us .
It &apos;s liquid .
We &apos;re trying to be invisible to the man &apos;s man .
As you see , the animals and people are doing the same things .
It turns out that it turns out to be the power of power and power .
When we come to the West , we &apos;re going to figure out how to find the jealousy of their heads .
So , if you have to make the power of the power , we &apos;re trying to cheat .
Well , we have the power of the power .
Do you know what I &apos;m going to do ?
And I see , the MBA has a lot of power .
They &apos;re like a leader of some of them , and they &apos;re looking at the room in the room , and they &apos;re looking at the room in the room , and they &apos;re going to be able to go into the space of the room .
They get the little two things in the room .
They &apos;re attached to this .
They &apos;re not invisible .
They &apos;re shocked as they &apos;re sitting , and they take them in this way .
I had a couple of things for my community .
The first is that it &apos;s going to be expanding .
The account is that it depends on this guy .
So the women who are more likely to be able to be able to put it out .
Women feel more assumed by people with their own people , and it &apos;s not an immune .
And it &apos;s very important to be successful .
And this is very important for the MBA , because it creates the data that they &apos;re working on .
We &apos;ve been looking at the high school schools in the world .
In the same level , and women and women are going to get different amounts of difference , and it looks like it &apos;s connected to the building .
I started thinking about it , and we have to think about it , and it &apos;s more activated at the time .
Is it going to make these videos more activated , and they &apos;re going to make these videos more activated ?
And it was not going to be the fact that it would not be the truth .
So let &apos;s show us the very short humility of our behavior , and can we feel more powerful about our behavior in our behavior ?
We know that our heads and the instruments are really important to think about the sense of our heads and the feelings . It &apos;s a lot of light .
But the question that makes us confident is that these gift and expressions have been able to act with our own .
And so we &apos;re also going to be able to be able to laugh in this picture between our teeth .
It &apos;s always relevant every two .
In the power of the power .
And we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to give us the power of power , which is more power , and it makes us feel powerless when it works to be strong .
It doesn &apos;t matter if we think that we &apos;re not thinking about it , it doesn &apos;t change our way of thinking , how we think of our activity .
When I think about power , I think , why do I think about it ?
I &apos;m talking about the idea of physics and feelings , and that &apos;s the hormones , and that &apos;s the hormones . I learn the hormones .
What is it that you think of the barriers of the mass ?
It doesn &apos;t matter that the power of power is not .
We say , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; You know .
And I &apos;m trying to play with them .
They chose the man &apos;s vote .
And the ones that are in the power of the boss , but it &apos;s 60 percent . That &apos;s how important it is .
And this is what we &apos;re fighting in the test .
I &apos;ve been in the test of 20 percent in the test of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the population .
Now , it &apos;s going to be a battery of changes to two minutes .
And these are the ones that are going on in the sport .
It &apos;s about 15 percent of the civilizations in the bathroom , and there was 15 percent of the diagnosis in the bathroom .
Now , two minutes , this letter , it &apos;s a lot of a lot of things that we have to make , and it &apos;s more likely to make the brain , and it &apos;s very comfortable , and it &apos;s a lot of good .
Now , this feeling is introduced to us , right ?
Well , the reason is that we have to think about how we think about how we think about how we think and feel it .
And the other thing about that is that we think about it .
And the question that makes us motivated is that we can make a few minutes to change our life , which is important to change our life .
This is a two-minute transformation in the lab .
So , what do you do in the way that it &apos;s in the world ?
Of course , this is what we think about .
We can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
What are we going to be able to make ?
It &apos;s the destruction of it for their new new families .
It &apos;s the school meetings for some of them .
It &apos;s the work , or it &apos;s in this picture , or it &apos;s a business personality .
We thought , you know , you have a lot of jobs , because you &apos;re very interested in this .
So we went to the barriers , the medical diagnosis , and that was what they call the jihadists , and that &apos;s what they said , &quot; &quot; Are we going to do that ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Of course , we made this idea . You know , you don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have it .
You &apos;re not going to do it .
That &apos;s not your heads .
You &apos;re going to be able to be able to create your imagination .
What do you do ?
You &apos;re sitting there . You &apos;re looking at the IPhone and the Android .
You &apos;re looking for your daughters , and you &apos;re able to blow your own , and you &apos;re in fact , what you &apos;re supposed to do is , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re sitting in .
That was what we wanted to find .
And the criticists were able to put the laboratory to the lab , and then they had a lot of a lot of work in a lot of a lot of jobs .
There was five minutes of personality .
And he taught them to help them to use the other images , and they were looking at them , and they looked like this , and they looked like this .
In five minutes , it &apos;s more likely to go to the question of the question .
Nobody doesn &apos;t like it .
Meanan LaFranh called this &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t stop it . &quot; &quot; This is the ceremony of the ceremony .
We &apos;ve been able to see them from a community to see things .
And then we showed them four of these images .
By the other , they were not familiar with our hospitals .
It &apos;s not the way that he got to the pocket . And then when you look at video-writing , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to work . &quot; &quot; And they would show them , &quot; &quot; We want to take it to work
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to take them work .
And it &apos;s more positive . &quot; &quot; So what is it going to happen to this ?
That &apos;s not their theory .
They &apos;re connected to their other things .
We &apos;ve been able to tell them what they &apos;re going to do , which is what they &apos;re going to do ?
Why do we have a number of advantage ?
There was no difference with these points .
And that &apos;s not what you &apos;ve seen .
People have only shown the real faces .
So they added their own attention .
They have never been able to show the idea as well as their own .
It creates this factor .
And when I say to people , we think about our behavior , our behavior , our behavior , the behavior of our behavior , says , &quot; &quot; Is this a little bit ?
I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make it .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not .
I don &apos;t want to feel if you &apos;re going to be able to make it .
I don &apos;t want to be an arm .
I don &apos;t want to be in the place where I &apos;m not an authentic .
I think of these words very well . I want to talk to you , &quot; &quot; I want to talk to you a little bit of my place . &quot; &quot; I want to talk about a tiny story .
In my age of 19 , I had a lot of heavy cartoons .
It &apos;s been taken from Europe .
I had a couple of times in the place .
I was born in the head of the brain , and I had to get the colony , and I went to the news , and I went to the news , and it was very painful for me . It was very painful for me .
I was the IQ man , because I was a kid who was smart and asked to be a kid who was smart .
For me , I was trying to go back from the colony .
They &apos;re saying to me : &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t get the lunch .
And the things that you can do is they &apos;re very , very , like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not a kid . &quot; &quot; And I started with it , and I started with this ambition that you have , which is what you have ,
I &apos;ve made it completely unique .
I worked , I worked , I was working in my own mind , and I was really going to do it .
I finished the colony .
I had to get four years old from my group of colleagues , and I &apos;ve got the Susan Frisk , which I had to give me to the Princeton University , the Susan Frisk , which I was not .
And I was a little bit of it .
In Princeton , 20 years ago , 20 years ago , I &apos;ve been listening to 20 minutes .
It was just the time .
I was so frustrated to open the morning , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to know . &quot; &quot; He said to me , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to do it .
It turns out that you &apos;re going to go and say , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to go .
And even though it &apos;s happening .
We &apos;re going to get all the conclusions that you are .
And again , if you &apos;re going to look at it , it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , if you don &apos;t listen to it , you &apos;re not listening . &quot; &quot; So , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
And it &apos;s also coming out of it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I did .
I &apos;ve been reading the high school of high school for five years , and a couple of years ago , I &apos;m in the Arab , I &apos;m going to work , I &apos;m not thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not thinking about it . &quot;
At the end of the first year I &apos;ve been in Harvard , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not talking about a lot of time . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to make it . &quot; &quot; I said
It would be a completely unique statement , he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not my place . &quot;
This is the turn of me .
Because two things happened .
The first thing was , I &apos;m not going to have a sense of that feeling .
But he made it feel , and my feelings were introduced to me .
The second thing was that I had to understand that he was the right place .
So he could be able to act that way .
And I said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s really humor .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to show you the best of the morning . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to show you a very good picture of it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; So
He was a change .
And I &apos;d like you to tell you .
And let me be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be relevant .
And what you &apos;d like to do is tell you how much you want to be .
You know , you can .
And documents can make a big change .
Now , this is two minutes I said .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
And the reason you &apos;re going to be able to be able to make a couple of minutes , and two minutes , try to do this , and in the high school , in the table , in the table , in the table , in the table
You want to leave .
Let &apos;s look at the best way of your brain .
Compare your protests . You &apos;ve got your lungs .
I couldn &apos;t tell you what I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t want to be able to finish with a phrase . &quot;
We &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; I know who I am , and I know who I am ! &quot; &quot; And you can see it .
And I want you to share it with you , and I &apos;m going to share it with the things that you have , because it &apos;s very important .
It &apos;s not the case . ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s how you learn , and the people who can help it , because the people who can benefit from that are the technology and the reactions , and what we can do is people who are
And you can do it with them , and they &apos;re going to be able to use it .
Because they can be able to make two minutes into their body , and they can make it important to their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have a lot of decisions in the world .
And the most marketing between their water forces is invisible .
The diagnostics are cooperation workers that have to get to live to live .
And they have been able to have a lot of the way that the system of the system was broken from the conflict of the system of the system .
They &apos;re going to be able to be able to benefit all the way to all the damage , and they &apos;re not going to thank them , but it &apos;s not going to thank them .
Here , in Bhallilion , the price of the data is 90 percent — they &apos;re communities .
It &apos;s a lot of a lot of the conservations , and they have a lot of construction , and it &apos;s a little bit of the expression .
They &apos;re the cars of the crowd , and the cars that are prepared from a little bit of the ceremony , and they &apos;re ready to get the size of the metal , and it &apos;s a little bit of it .
And that &apos;s the reason why I didn &apos;t know with the driver characters .
I &apos;m an activist , and I &apos;m an activist , which is the question of the question , the politics of politics and politics and space , and it &apos;s a lot of the things that are going to be protected .
In 2007 , I turned the way to the molecule of my job in 2007 .
But I &apos;ve also been able to stand up with this .
And I had a lot of work in my work , and I &apos;m going to have a lot more , and I would have to help them to increase these charges and refer to their own ownership .
These days , they &apos;re in the middle of the high school and the ethical medicine .
So , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been working on with the world , and I &apos;ve been working on this stage .
In many cases , I had a lot of CO2 , and I was going into a lot of the world , and I &apos;ve been able to move a lot of it in the world .
And I had the other thing , which is that they &apos;re going to be in Brasilian .
I also came up in the country in the General , the Constitution , the Grand Africa , in Turkey , in Turkey , in Turkey , even in the country .
And I realized that more people have to be done , because it was a big job .
After that , I &apos;ve created a dream under the head of &quot; &quot; the Group . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) — it &apos;s a dream that you know if it &apos;s a good thing .
Thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
So , &quot; &quot; The Committee of the Commissioner &quot; &quot; was a huge amount of activity that was created with the diagnosis and his cards .
The diagnostics , the bathrooms , the bathrooms , the hair , the sales , the bathrooms , the desert therapies , and that &apos;s the kind of professional professionals .
He would be able to be able to be able to look at the features of our volunteers , and they would be able to see the features of security , and the things that were going to be able to see a good thing .
They &apos;ve been able to get other ways for security , and they &apos;re flexible . They &apos;re magic and beauty .
And finally , it would be part of a great , big thing , and they would be part of a big thing .
He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; São Pauo , &quot; &quot; and he was taken by Rio and Josanese and Kurbian .
But I &apos;ve been inspired by TEDx , and I was inspired by TEDx , and we created the President of the &quot; &quot; the School &quot; &quot; , and we created Pimxx , which is a reduced version of the revenue
So , it would be like .
In two years , 170 volunteers , 800 volunteers , and 2000 , and 2000 , we had to go to the &quot; &quot; Collaboratory . &quot; &quot; And it was in the high school , and it has been replaced by
And then they would be the people who were going to look at the invisible , and they would be the people who were being treated .
They may have been able to be able to think of the people in the audience , and they could be able to increase the community and the community .
Now , you know , you &apos;re looking at it , and I &apos;m calling you the diagnosis of invisible water , and I call them the description .
Let &apos;s see a whole whole way from the world and the drivers .

The name of the Islamic Islam gave me to see what a lot of people are in the world , which is a lot of people .

We &apos;ve changed 20 years of life as I was 19 years old , and it was a little bit of my friend who was going to be a little bit of my friends .
And it would be something that we had to be able to feel in my mind , and we would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to think about it .
In the course of the next time , I was going to turn the kids in the middle of the kids .
I was going to get my self out of my own side of my self , and that was what happened to me that the new poetry was the most terrorist and the top of the new poetry .
And so I &apos;ve got a lot of time in the house , and I was sitting on the house , and I was going to play a game and play a game .
And so I had a lot of punishment in my grandparents , and I didn &apos;t have the fact that one of the reality of the life of life was not prepared by the real face of life .
I grew up in a business that people are going to be able to be able to do as well as religion and religion .
What happened to what happened ?
One of my first inventions that I think about is the time of the first invention of the first invention of the first invention of 2000 .

Our group of our group is the same people in the past people .
I learned that one of the kids I &apos;ve been collected in the last days of the Convention in the last day .
So , this is a couple of questions , and I had a couple of other things that I had ever been in , and I had the difference between the two of us .
I didn &apos;t have a primary friend , and I &apos;ve heard the sense that I had a sense that I had a sense of confidence that I had a lot of time in my lifetime .
And the other thing that was more important , it was the work that I &apos;ve found for the Yay Buckch , and I &apos;ve found that I &apos;ve been able to find a little bit for a little bit .
Now , I was in the way people who were in the world , and I was in the world of people who were in the past of this experiment .
I &apos;ve learned that my life has a big feeling of homosurgery , and I &apos;ve learned that all of the numbers in my grandmother had a lot of me .
And he came to work , and I &apos;ve been trying to work in one of the general archives , and I &apos;ve been trying to study a lot of people who have seen a lot of them in the way that they &apos;re very small .
It &apos;s a moment for me to give me an exhibition that I can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And I &apos;ve been looking at my mind with a real life experience that I &apos;ve learned from my child &apos;s life .
I don &apos;t know how to be able to be able to be a moment , and I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be done because of the reason that it &apos;s not a joke .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; The Dai Show . &quot; &quot; Con Studio , I decided to be honest , and I would help me to tell you that the human power of religion , religious and gender or gender or gender or gender
The Con Studio , when I heard the ancestor , the word for me , he took me to me .
The inspiration came from the world , and I had to show that the government of the state of law , which is the way that I had a lot of more confidence of the world &apos;s view of the world &apos;s view of the world .
In a day , I had a conversation that I &apos;ve been able to change my view of the world , and I was told that I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to get my mother in my lifetime .
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a lot of people who had a lot of money in the U.S. &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; I &apos;m scared to people . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m
And I realized that there was a sense that I would give you a sense of mindfulness in a moment , how much energy it is .
The time Ebla is not the fact that I &apos;m not the real step .
I also changed my name , and I &apos;ve been able to make my name in a new life .
Why didn &apos;t I take my own sense ?
And the answer is as well as the answer .
And that &apos;s why I hope that one of the reasons why it &apos;s going to happen is that one of the things that I have to do is make my story , and there &apos;s a difference that &apos;s better , and I didn &apos;t think that we
In the way , I chose to use the life of the life of the life of the life of the life that I was going to be able to use .

I &apos;m going to make the whole movement of the Terolism quarter , and I &apos;m going to give them the motion of the way that it doesn &apos;t matter .
So , as I meet , I &apos;m a living condition that I &apos;ve been listening to in the way that I was listening to the way it was , and it &apos;s not the way it was to go to the way it was .
I &apos;m not like her .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) I know each other . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Your morning !
Isn &apos;t it ?
They took the step down on their face , but I wanted to ask you , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s in the south of the star ? &quot;
Anyone ? Who ? Okay , not the problem .
One day , I was sitting in the restaurant , and I was sitting in the rest of the restaurant .
I didn &apos;t look at the office , and I said , &quot; &quot; You have it ? ( Laughter )
He looked at me to think that the word was equal .
He said , &quot; &quot; Do you see ? ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Men . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , what do they say ? &quot; &quot; And I know , &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; French innovation , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a French innovation ?
&quot; &quot; Give , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Wonderful . &quot; &quot; He said .
He was able to talk about me . He said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you were the most likely one in this world , I didn &apos;t look at it . &quot;
What do I say to the word &quot; &quot; Men &quot; &quot; ?
And I had a couple of words , and he had a lot of time , and he had a ceremony .
So , how do he want to talk to it ?
So I started thinking about me .
This was me .
This is a really good way of man !
And they don &apos;t have me to talk about my own language in my own country .
Can it be done in other ways ?
How did we fall here ?
But when we &apos;re here , I have a lot of people here in their own lives , and they &apos;re doing a little bit of things that you can see in their own lives , and they have a lot of things that you have in the past
I have to forget the whole civilization , my mind , the way I think about my community ?
The kids who were in the case of the concrete could be our best lungs !
I &apos;m going to be able to get all the things I learned in the school .
Do I forget to be one of them ?
So , what was my self ?
So , we didn &apos;t look at all of this , I tried to deal with it .
I didn &apos;t want to be able to do it with my own exhibition .
The first language doesn &apos;t give the students out of this day .
He &apos;s not the language of the experience , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re used in the university , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re used in university , and it &apos;s not the language that we use in the air list
If we were , they were going to do our pigs .
So , what do I do with my language ? We &apos;re going to give us this water !
You don &apos;t want to be able to use the school .
It &apos;s a relevant .
But there &apos;s another reaction that we &apos;re not thinking about .
It &apos;s the moment of language .
It says that you have to be able to deal with it , and you have to have a perfect language in the other languages .
It &apos;s a little bit to make sense of the idea of thinking about the idea of thinking about our collective language .
What ?
The Ciberan River was removed from the school of the school in the first time when I started writing the Ciberan first .
The whole idea of all of his ideas , the fact that the fact that it &apos;s a lot of the difference and the disease of the life , the fact that it was a little bit smooth from the young son .
So , when he started writing in that English language , he had a lot of the size of her .
And in the summer , when you read her papers in the summer , you feel like you &apos;re sitting in the summer , and you have the feelings of this feeling .
You can imagine that it &apos;s written in English in English , which is the son of the Lacan mountains .
This is a certain thing that no one is supposed to be garden .
Secondly , the theory says , if you want to kill a billion , the way you want to kill a billion years , it will kill his language .
This is a reconciliation that the people who have been infected .
Germans , the French , they do , they — these miles — these miles are different .
And so they are able to make their own language .
They &apos;re doing it .
And so they use a lot of language in the demand of language .
We know more than them ?
Well , we &apos;re talking about the world that we believe in the world , and that &apos;s what we &apos;d like to think about , and we wanted to go to the world with the world .
And when we were in a time , we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
They have the language of the language .
Because if you take a chance to take a poor , and if you take a chance to get a poor , it doesn &apos;t mean , it doesn &apos;t be fair , it doesn &apos;t , it &apos;s not fair .
You wouldn &apos;t believe that he was in the place .
They were like the first one , as we &apos;re in the other time , as we &apos;re in the other times .
So they had to release their own languages to innovate .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Az , we &apos;re going to remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What if we remind you about what it is ?
What if you don &apos;t know what it is , right ?
Who is not going to think about how and why .
It &apos;s not the time of our own mouth , and it &apos;s not the case for the copy of our mouth .
The language is an example of the activity of the activity of our lives and our motivations that are connected to our motivation .
So , as we say , &quot; &quot; Az , &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; Az , &quot; &quot; in the case of every single one of you , is that every single one of you is looking at the same images , the fact that it
It &apos;s not a second , two and three words , and it &apos;s not a zero .
He &apos;s what we think about how we think about what we &apos;re thinking about , what we &apos;re looking at , and what they &apos;re looking for us is that it &apos;s a lot of things that we &apos;ve seen to see how they see us .
What is the structure ?
You can say , &quot; &quot; You know , this person is falling , or don &apos;t you ?
So , I say , &quot; &quot; Az , the shark , the Muslim , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; Oh , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot; &quot; when you can &apos;t live in the age of
How do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , it &apos;s good , and I &apos;m going to go out , and I &apos;m not talking about empty space .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to do with us , and it &apos;s the way we think about it .
I have a French friend that &apos;s married for my grandfather .
I asked him one day , how does it work ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is true . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;ve been working for her for a day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a word &quot; &quot; dust . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then the
And he had done it , and he said , &quot; &quot; How do you have to be so familiar ?
It wants to be constructed ?
&quot; &quot; Bas ? &quot; &quot; In English , it &apos;s one of the mammals .
And so we started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , the woman doesn &apos;t know it . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s good for him to deal with it , and it &apos;s good to get it .
My friend said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to give me the Freek . &quot; &quot; And I was just trying to give me the rest of the time , which is when I &apos;m listening to her , and I &apos;m going
Take this for me .
( Applause ) What do we do to protect the school ?
We turn it into the state of the community , and we &apos;re starting to go to the camp to protect the school language .
And we said , a lot of people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why would you be comfortable ?
It &apos;s just to forget it , and it &apos;s not the problem . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not the problem !
It was the winter of the campaign , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about what I &apos;m talking about . &quot;
We said , &quot; &quot; You know , we don &apos;t . We don &apos;t get it or it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose that way , because they can &apos;t deal with us .
And if you talk about me in that way , I &apos;m going to give me a word of language .
We &apos;re not saying , ( Applause ) We want to change our own resolution , and we &apos;re able to change our desires , our desires , our desires .
We &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to think and think about what &apos;s like us .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about what I &apos;m talking about . &quot; &quot; It was a puzzle in the place when he said to me .
So , in the same time , it &apos;s creative and intellectual .
And then we started with another truck written in the bag .
You don &apos;t see this example , and it &apos;s written in the entire river , and he said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill the baby . &quot;
Why ? I mean , it &apos;s not going to kill the language .
We have to kill our language .
If we had to kill our language , we had to find our identity .
We had to find our construction .
We had to go back to the beginning .
It &apos;s really serious for us to make our ability to be able to make it .
And after that , we had the images of the poorest sons and girls , and we had the images of the girls .
&quot; &quot; Colol &quot; &quot; is the images of the girls and the sons .
We &apos;re a lot of &quot; &quot; cock . &quot;
And who said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;ve got a word of English ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; and I give me
I &apos;m going to say &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the world of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it &apos;s done ! We need to take our own sense .
But we have to believe that we have to believe in the future , and we have to be able to give us a lot of bigger people , and we have a lot of things that we have in our own face , and you &apos;re thinking about
It &apos;s the ideal to be an artist .
We can be able to be able to fly in the universe , and we don &apos;t know if we can be created in the universe , and we can be creative .
You &apos;re ready for all of you , every single one of you .
It &apos;s a way of creativity in your main language .
Let &apos;s start with this .
So let &apos;s write a little movie or a short film .
The romance can make us global .
It can be able to be able to be able to be able to make this school language .
It &apos;s not a way to say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no way to say , &quot; &quot; I have the way to say !
But we need to know and believe it , and we have to be a sense of the way that it &apos;s the way it is .
In addition , what can you do this day ?
Who is the shoes , who is it ?
And so I &apos;m going to give you a lot of things , and I &apos;m going to give you a lot of people who are in English .
But don &apos;t write in the summer in the middle of the school .
( Applause ) That &apos;s a flexible ! That &apos;s not language .
You &apos;re going to be a viral language in the viral world .
It &apos;s not an assumption that &apos;s going to go back to a place .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we have a lot of other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not collecting one of us here to believe in one of us here .
We are here , and we &apos;re going to do this language .
Now , let me open you a magic .
So , you know the first time in the door , and you know your own ancestor .
I &apos;m born with my daughter , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; This is the case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Applause ) So , let &apos;s get our sense to make it out . ( Applause )
So a couple of years ago , the American philosophy Morgan Serbomb , the U.S. philosophy Morgan Score , is going to go to the moons .
I &apos;ve learned a couple of things that I could do with these 30 days .
And the way that the months of the months came out to be more mindful .
And for a month , I took a picture every day in a month .
I &apos;m trying to start with 30 days .
I learned .
By the way , this is the magic day that it &apos;s not written by the fossil days .
And you &apos;ll end up with my name .
It &apos;s very cool .
I &apos;m not going to say to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a cosmic race .
No , I can say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer . &quot;
I &apos;ve learned that I could be able to be able to be a little bit of crystal and stop , and I could be able to be able to be alive .
In fact , they &apos;re very fun .

The first day I started college , the first day I started college and your option .
And when I read good , I had the president , and I started with the work of love , and I started with a lot of work with the courage of the love and the road .
It was a wonderful image that was made in the high school and the road , and it was an intellectual image .
And the first thing is , I &apos;m very glad to be , and I &apos;m going to make sure that I would feel like the guys who were not in the future and the future , and I &apos;m going to feel that I would feel like
But I learned that I &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re going to shut up .
It was so sensitive to the literacy , which was so interesting , I knew that the first election was finished , and the first one was not going to be able to do it .
So , as I &apos;ve been talking about , I &apos;ve been able to have a joke , and I &apos;ve been in my water , and I &apos;ve been a joke that was a shop , and when I was going on the room , I
I had no one in the side of the side , and I was in the side of life , and it was not sustainable .
In fact , the books of the books have gone through the battery .
&quot; &quot; Oh , he opens the door . &quot; &quot; — I was equal .
It was a beginning .
And when I had a week , I &apos;ve been talking about what I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;ve been talking about the third picture of my name .
&quot; Oh , it &apos;s a ship . &quot;
Now , the Stasi , the hair , and he was a lot of my friend , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I thought , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the feature that I &apos;m not going to
For the story , I had my own feeling and my own feeling of my own feeling and my own feeling of my own feeling .
I had never been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to work , and I felt like I felt that I was trying to work with my motivation , the future , the future .
I &apos;ve been talking about what I &apos;ve been talking about , and he came to the moment .
And it turns out that the normal people , the normal people , were not equal , and I was a serious pocket to my equality .
And the question was that it was a little bit of a fluid , and I had a result , and I went to the second big case , and I decided to be the second great case .
What I &apos;m looking at is what I &apos;m looking at .
And I &apos;ve seen that I &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
I needed this brand and village , and I started talking to him , and I started talking to him .
In the moment , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to tell me about me .
I was based on the Proxon , and it &apos;s like a lot of things that I said , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you know , you know , I think , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well
For the story , I used to work with the gift of the camp of the camp , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I want to say , &quot; &quot; I want to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go ,
I &apos;d like to read about six or a half seconds . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I have to read a little bit of the little book . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I have to read a little bit of a
After that , he started to get out of the past .
And I was in the audience , and when I went to the schedule , he went to a schedule , and then the best one : it &apos;s a very challenging sense of hope and the future .
I was in the case that I was in my life , and I think that I was able to make my challenge , and I &apos;ve been able to make my architect , and I had to make my architect .
It was a little bit of a little bit of a psychiin , which was a kind of crowd , and it began to get the number of people in the world , and it began to make a lot of sense .
I &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to see a world that was unique and hopeful , and I &apos;m really immune in this world .
For the story , I think that I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to change my life , and it &apos;s a little bit of the way that we can see my life in
In fact , we &apos;ve got a lot of scripts , like three consumptions of the mirror , and it &apos;s more added to the other , and it &apos;s a lot of dramatic discoveries , and you see , you see , you
Do you see the status of water ?
It &apos;s the top of the water , and he said , &quot; &quot; I did . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the same , and that &apos;s what I did .
In fact , it has been a lot of time , and it had been an unbelievable and unconscious , and I had no sense of my own power , and I was not going to be able to create humor and peace .
Two years later , I went to work .
And then I was a lot of my daughter , and it &apos;s very remarkable , and it &apos;s a little bit of the numbers that we &apos;re not going to deal with .
So , Ruhi &apos;s primary selection , the physical words , the physical and sexual and sexy cells , he said to me , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s more comfortable than that schedule . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot;
Now , in the past , I think that I think that there &apos;s a feature of the world , and it &apos;s the killer of a feature , and I think it &apos;s a little bit of it .
It &apos;s been used to be a little bit of it , and it was a little bit of the right , and it was the right to go back to a moment that I had to be in the end of it .
A lot of people who have been able to look at me , and I had a lot of people who have helped me to help me , and I had a lot of it in the audience who helped me to help me .
And what happened is that I &apos;ve been trained , and my partners and my middle hands , and my partners and my partners , and I &apos;m ready to look at it , and I &apos;m ready to look at it , and I &apos;m ready
And I believe that Elexor is looking at this .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you &apos;re in the monkey , it &apos;s going to be the impact . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 14 minutes . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m 14 minutes , and I don &apos;t want
But they &apos;ve been prepared to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
I &apos;d like to say that they were able to figure out me , and the best thing I &apos;ve always been thinking about , I &apos;ve always been thinking about what I was thinking about .
Of course , it was the challenge to believe that it was in the past and the country , and I said , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve been able to tell you that I would be able to make my first job as well .
And I learned that it &apos;s not like the same thing that I had to do with my home , and it &apos;s not like the rest of my home , and it &apos;s not like the reward and the object , and it &apos;s not like a
I believe them .
In a time , I &apos;ve been sitting in the front of my president , and I &apos;m going to take them to the invention of the invention that I had to give them a real account .
And because I had a problem , I had a lot of coast in home , because I was a problem in the house , and he was sitting in the room , and I was sitting in the room of the room .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t do my job .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Do you see it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the trauma . That was my trauma .
And then I &apos;ve been able to figure out what my mystery was in the audience , and I was able to figure out how much more vulnerable that I was going to feel in the way , because I would thank them , because when
And I started to give them the next thing , and I started to give them a lot of time , and I started to try to try to try to try and learn our studio .
And I learned that all of this is in the world that I couldn &apos;t solve , and I didn &apos;t know if I couldn &apos;t be able to solve it .
Suddenly , these creatures have been in the place , and I &apos;ve discovered the words that were the most recent and the conclusion , and I discovered that this is the same thing that I had to do with the most recent and a lot
And after you &apos;re going to make this , it &apos;s really , in fact , it &apos;s just a lot of time , and we &apos;ve been able to go back to the features of the features , and I went back to the
For the first time , 10 years later , the first time I was equal , I &apos;ve been the bottom of the university , I graduated at the top of the university , and a year later , I got the highest magnitude .
And one of the things happened to me .
I don &apos;t tell you , I &apos;m going to take it out of all of them .
As he said , he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Say , &quot; &quot; as he said .
We can &apos;t know about two conversations in the same term .
I &apos;ve been working in a very powerful way , and I &apos;ve been able to do the books and the data , and I &apos;m going to do it , and I &apos;m going to do it , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit
And I was listening to the next time I was listening to them , and I &apos;ve learned the life of the life and the ability to make it .
In my life , I could help you to help the last one of the most popular memories that was going to be done in the world .
Now , I &apos;m going to hear that the organization of the International Institute , the U.K.
And the way it comes to the future and the understanding of it is that you can get the differences in the world , and it &apos;s just a lot of time .
It &apos;s possible that the universe is possible , it &apos;s also going to be increased .
There &apos;s a demonstration that &apos;s not reading , and it doesn &apos;t go back to the back , and it doesn &apos;t go back to the back .
It doesn &apos;t have to be free .
And it doesn &apos;t want to be the other people who don &apos;t .
And so , I mean , it &apos;s not the case of the world , and it &apos;s not just the words that they have to change and change the world and change the world and change the world and change the world .
In the last 20 years , in the last 20 years , it &apos;s been spread in five and 26 countries , and it &apos;s expanding the possibilities of people who have a lot of motivation and spirituality and spiritual challenges .
As the Peter Lail said , it &apos;s an extinction that has an interactive spirit that has an interactive spirit for human health .
This is the biggest thing for our society — the biggest thing that needs to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
We have been replaced by flexibility and curiosity , and we have to live with it .
We &apos;re like , you &apos;re happy .
It doesn &apos;t have to take the thing that we &apos;ve ever seen , and it doesn &apos;t have to do it .
It &apos;s not going to be clear .
As a good parent said to me , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the first thing to tell you is what &apos;s going on .
I &apos;m talking about it . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .

I &apos;m here to talk about my automography .
But is this photograph ?
Because , of course , it &apos;s not a picture of your camera .
At the other time , my brand in photograph , when I took my first photo on the first 15 years old .
And I went to the architecture of the first one , and I was a little bit of a little bit , because I was a little bit of planned from the camera .
When you take a picture of a picture of a picture , it &apos;s ready when you get a picture of the story .
For me , photography was not the right place to be in the right place .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; I could do this every single thing .
So I wanted to create something different , and then it &apos;s something that it starts to benefit after .
These images like this : it &apos;s the feature that &apos;s going on in a way .
But it turned out to be an unbelievable game .
And we can &apos;t look at this , it looks like it is .
Or the pictures like this — it &apos;s a very dark humor , but it &apos;s a very important thing .
In fact , I think of the photo-reaction , the photo-restaurant .
Because , of course , that &apos;s not the pictures that we can really look at , but I wanted to be able to look at a camera with a camera .
I &apos;d like to do some of the images that you can &apos;t deal with to deal with the future .
So it &apos;s just about trying to keep the moment more right than the moment to keep the moment .
What about the fact that it &apos;s going to look for the truth ?
Have you ever been to the eyes if they don &apos;t have these stages ?
Is it going to be like this ?
What is the dolphin ?
It &apos;s the perspective of a lot of illnesses .
But in the end , the world is going to deal with how it works , two-dimensional .
It &apos;s not really what this resolution is , it &apos;s really what it is to do .
So it &apos;s also the right thing .
I see this in a place that I &apos;ve created in a place where I create an alternative regime , which I create an alternative regime .
Let me show you one example .
There are the physical conditions that you can imagine here in three years , which is a three-dimensional basis , the three-dimensional world .
But in a way , it looks like three-dimensional objects that are there , which is the three-dimensional object .
So we know that it doesn &apos;t exist .
So we &apos;re playing playing with my brain , because our brain doesn &apos;t know that the resolution is not the resolution .
And I see the same proportion of the same process .
And this is actually a lot of different benefits .
So the things that you have to show a picture is really the things that we can &apos;t think about , in our daily lives , in our daily lives , the things that are in our lives .
And it &apos;s really important to get the pictures , because it &apos;s really important , because there &apos;s a little bit of it .
What I want to say is that there are three ways that we have to talk about a real thing .
As you see , these images don &apos;t have a lot of things .
But in fact , this is a thing .
So the first thing is that the images of the pictures that have been a little bit of it have to be the same .
Secondly , the pictures of the pictures have to be the same .
And in these two images , these two kinds of images — the same rise , and the same light .
And the third thing was that the picture was broken , and it &apos;s a very important thing to get out of one of the things that came out of the crowd .
It &apos;s going to be a little bit easier to know how to do it .
It &apos;s going to look at the differences between the different images , and I can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
This is another example .
( Laughter ) People can think that this is the bottom of a species , and they think it &apos;s the bottom line .
But in fact , this picture has been created by the pictures of different places .
I think it &apos;s more likely to create a place , and you don &apos;t need to be able to change your ideals , and you don &apos;t need to change your ideals .
But it &apos;s a lot of planning .
And I knew that I would have a couple of different places to find the parts of this idea , and it &apos;s going to be a couple of different places to find the parts of it .
So , for example , it &apos;s the picture of the fish .
The judgments are different things .
The water sixth was playing in a middle house .
And why , in fact , I couldn &apos;t paint the entire house of Sweden in the middle of the land in the middle of the land .
So it &apos;s going to be possible , and I think it &apos;s possible to be able to be able to plan .
There &apos;s always a plan , it starts to think about it .
And then it &apos;s going to be a different picture .
In this picture , every single piece of work was a very good plan .
And if you &apos;re doing the pictures , we &apos;re going to be good , and it &apos;s also a very good thing , and it &apos;s also a lot of reality .
So there are all the cities that we need , and the same thing that we need to do is our power power .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Johnna , you &apos;re nice .
So it was a database that Wikipedia , the thing that the whole world was published in the last year , was publishing more data than the data of the world of the world .
Is that possible ?
Juan Asphan : Yes , it &apos;s possible that this is true ?
It &apos;s not a very uncomfortable thing that the world &apos;s medical medicine is not going to work so much , and it &apos;s a little bit more likely to build the group in the entire world of the entire world .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people publish these scenes ?
How does it be able to be able to make a dictionary ?
JA : These are the data that &apos;s unique to our skin , and it &apos;s a variety of kinds of data for us to play with us .
We have to take the article to the Internet , and it &apos;s a database to make it comfortable in the Internet , like Sweden and Badka , which is called Sweden and Badka .
It &apos;s the form of the format , and it has a lot of people who are in the right news , and it &apos;s a form of things , and it &apos;s forming , and it &apos;s kind of a little bit of time — it can
CA : So , I mean , you don &apos;t know who &apos;s the government of the world , and you don &apos;t know who it is , and you don &apos;t know who it is .
JA : It &apos;s true . We &apos;re familiar with them , which is the way you see the data of the data .
( Talk ) The phone is a joke .
( Laughter ) CA : I think the CIA was asking the code of the TED . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to think about the right magnets .
This is a few years ago , a few years ago .
So what &apos;s going on in this thing ?
It was a story from Kenya .
How can you talk about this story ?
JA : This is the Greek Report .
After 2004 , after 2004 , it was the study of the Kenya of Kenya .
In Kenya , 2004 , I had been taken from Daniel array in Kenya in Kenya 18 years .
It was a diagram in Kenya .
And when the power of the Coalia , the power of Canada , they published two million pounds , and they published two million tons of packaging .
In Kenya , that &apos;s the case that I was in Kenya in Kenya , and now they used to be able to use political power to the Moon .
Kenya is like the book of Kenya .
In 2007 , I had a little bit of Kenya in Kenya , a little bit of Kenya .
And this calculate , we published three days after the new privilege of a new privilege of the Ministry of December Daniel Daniel .
CA : It &apos;s a long word — it &apos;s not to be able to calculate Kenya , and so if we think about it , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
JA : Yeah . In the beginning of the Guardian , then in the world of Guardian , then in the countries around Kenya , Tanzania and Cebru Africa .
It came from the moon .
In a couple of days , Kenya began to write comfortable with the Kenya of Kenya .
In the 20 days , we &apos;ve been published in Kenya in Kenya , and the number of people in Kenya had changed 10 percent of the president of terrorism .
CA : So how did you make the data really changed the world ?
JA : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : And this is a little bit of a video of the air in Britain .
The video is a little long . It &apos;s a short clip .
I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of violence in this video .
Radio : Well , the mind is opening up .
Now , they look at Xmic .
Come on . Ah .
Look at all the time . It &apos;s the sun .
Try all of it .
Ah , jump !
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So let &apos;s go through the European gun ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
Otel — Bushama Taw-Sx , Bushama Tu-Sx .
I had to stop , now !
It was done , we killed eight things .
There are two and no , and I &apos;m trying to throw it up .
It &apos;s gone . He died .
Tw--xx , Tw Sx-Ex , and we move around .
Oop . So what did he do ?
Zius , Kuh . Ahaa , okay , hahahaha .
CA : How did this video happen ?
JA : That &apos;s what happened for people who were involved .
And to study this video with the video , it was two things in the Bright .
This is actually one of three cells in the video .
CA : So , I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m going to have 11 things in this cell , and it killed 11 things in my cell ?
JA : Yes . Two Rule workers died , two kids created .
In my country , 18-26 things died .
CA : And that &apos;s why it &apos;s a wide exponential .
What was the first reason for you to think about it ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think people saw the power of power .
It &apos;s going to be the Arabic and the Amazon of the people who are going to be comfortable with the three , and it &apos;s not just a reason — and it &apos;s not any reason .
There were two teenagers that they had to see , and they had two jihadists who saw their own work .
CA : It &apos;s the Ministry of security , Bradley Manhattan , and that &apos;s what it turns out , in the question of the morning , the 2800s of the United States of the 280,000 ABS company would be able to
That &apos;s true ?
JA : We &apos;ve got these writers .
So , five days ago , after 150,000 writers , it &apos;s a lot after the 150,000 writers .
In this case , we have to publish the picture of the Minister of the United States , but they don &apos;t have to do it with this work .
I had the answer to that slide .
CA : Would you do the diplomatic memories of the United States ?
JA : We can publish them . ( Applause ) JA : Yes . ) JA : Why ? ) ( CA : Why ? ) JA : Well , that &apos;s what the country is really doing in the country , the human rights of
They have these kinds of materials .
CA : That &apos;s a little bit of a little bit .
In fact , if you &apos;re in the ideology , if you &apos;re in the ideology ?
What do you think you have the right account of the hidden scenes ?
JA : So there &apos;s a question for the world , and it can be a matter of quality of activity , and it can be a reason to make it new .
In fact , it &apos;s a lot of the formats .
And it &apos;s obvious that the institutions of the government work for the mystery of the organization , which is a new and good thing that &apos;s going to be a good thing , is that the institutions that have the data that have the data that they
It &apos;s always happening in the spinal cord . It &apos;s connected to the history of Juranese .
CA : But it &apos;s not a little bit of security , and when you have a disability , people can be a market for the whole community .
JA : And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the data that we &apos;ve published .
So we have a problem of power .
We have a little bit of different formats , and then we &apos;re going to publish it , and then we publish it .
There &apos;s also a moment of cats — it &apos;s a good thing , which is a lot of people who don &apos;t really know what it &apos;s going to do , but we &apos;re going to work with the goods that you know what it really does
CA : Well , it &apos;s good for their work .
If you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
The United States shows that people die .
It shows that there &apos;s no human feeling of human beings in this world , which is not the human feeling .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s not my son . &quot; &quot; And what would you give you ? &quot; &quot; Why would you give it a question ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s a lot of them .
But you don &apos;t need to see that this video of the people in Britain , Ara , I don &apos;t need to see this video every day ; they see them every day .
It &apos;s not the idea of their idea . It &apos;s not a matter of feelings .
Every day , it &apos;s like this .
It &apos;s going to change the role of people who are paying for this glamour . That &apos;s what we have .
CA : So you don &apos;t find a way of lighting the hidden waves of the world and companies .
It &apos;s going to get rid of it .
But this is what happens to you , for lighting the waves , you need to be able to take their own sense of self-esteem .
JA : It &apos;s not very good . The future was not going to be the WikiLrix .
Or we don &apos;t have the data of the future .
And if they have these things , it can be hard for us , and we &apos;re going to work for us , and we &apos;re trying to help us to help us work with their work , and they &apos;re trying to help us to help ourselves .
CA : I think it &apos;s very interesting to me about what we &apos;re trying to do — what do they think about the TED audience ?
There are two kinds of ideas in WikiLrix and Julia .
One — it &apos;s the time that light is lighting .
The other is a lot of peaceful .
Who thinks that ?
What about the security ?
JA : Well , it must be a couple of men if not yet .
CA : That &apos;s my work , Juran .
We need to work less . Let me show you another mirror .
And I think it &apos;s not going to be published , but I think it &apos;s going to be published in TED .
This is an interesting thing that &apos;s going on in the lines ?
Why is this ?
JA : This is one example of what we see every day .
At the end of the last year — in Northern Albia , the Mexico , the Mexico of Mexico , is not as strong as the power of the universe .
So we took this engineer to calculate that , in fact , it &apos;s the way that the fossil companies have been replaced by the way of the guidelines of the fossil companies .
The Albia and the heads and the heads were there .
And the challenge of the engineer was not any time with them . It was a little bit of time .
We didn &apos;t know what he was writing and what &apos;s going on .
We had a little bit of puzzle , which is the game of the eight / 11 company .
And so , in this , we did what we did , and we wrote , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little puzzle .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do .
Well , it &apos;s true . We can &apos;t know the whole thing . &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t know about a few weeks ago , and we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to make a letter to the company , and we &apos;ve been
Are you talking about the next thing ?
What are you going to do as a dynamic ?
It &apos;s really important ? &quot; &quot; And they were in the screen in the screen , the Microsoft WD ID in the screen .
So it &apos;s taken .
( Applause ) There &apos;s a lot of them .
It &apos;s one of the ways that you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to the text .
CA : Now , what do you do with the BP- ?
JA : Well , it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very much , and they &apos;re going to do a lot of things .
The last couple of months , we have to reduce the fact that we &apos;re going to make a lot of things that are going to be done for the last few months .
This is a little problem .
And as the institutions that start in the other new process , we &apos;re going to grow up with a huge amount of construction , and it doesn &apos;t have a lot of data , but we don &apos;t have enough work to make all these data .
CA : Well , what is the case that you need to say , is that the most important volunteers that you need to do ?
JA : Yes . It &apos;s the people we &apos;re going to believe .
In fact , the data that &apos;s going to be done in a few different ways is that they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
CA : Now , can you say that it &apos;s going to work ?
In fact , I could read in the case of 37 schools in the child .
That &apos;s the data ?
JA : In fact , I had a film in the movie , and I was going through the religious school , the two of them .
( Laughter ) CA : And the psychologists would have been thinking about this great parano .
JA : What do you get to the movie ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : It would be a lot of time in the age of the age , and it would be the problem of a quarter .
JA : I &apos;m a Juranese .
I was one of the volunteers of an activist .
I was in the age of the young age , and I was going to be surprised by the jur .
It &apos;s a little bit of the way to a little bit of life .
It &apos;s possible to do different things with beauty .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of the weight for the Russian market for the Russian price of the Sun , and they &apos;re going to be able to laugh in the bank account .
It &apos;s not like the fact that it &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s not the first one .
CA : And I &apos;m not thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not thinking about what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; What are the values of the values , and what are the values ?
If you can give them a short data , or why can you talk about them ?
JA : Well , I &apos;m not going to do it .
But the question is , I think , you know , I think that people don &apos;t create a lot of dragonflies ; it &apos;s helpful .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve learned from the people who have never been in the life .
CA : Well , it doesn &apos;t create the human box ; it &apos;s not the human box .
JA : I &apos;m just a little bit of people , and I &apos;m not going to show them , I &apos;m not going to show you the paper , but so I &apos;m going to give people a lot of people who are going to make people
And this is my job for a long time .
CA : Can you talk about what &apos;s happening in the last few minutes ?
It was the problem that he was published there , and it was a problem of battery , and it was given to the future .
On the way , the page was conducted .
You created good inventions in Island . And then what happened ?
JA : That &apos;s a big thing .
It was the ideal in Sland in Sland .
It was one of the biggest insects in the world .
In the banking sector , it was 10 times more than a lot of things .
We published this article in the last year of the year .
It was five years ago that he had been published in the courage TV , and it was about five years ago , and it was about five years ago , and he didn &apos;t know what he was going to do , and he didn &apos;t know
And we published the news in the front of your television , and we were in the Sland in Sland , and we &apos;ve been talking about it , but we &apos;ve been talking about it .
In fact , every one of the things that I had to do is I would have been able to give you a little bit of the world , and after a couple of Sland politicians , and after the first one of the Slandland ,
And I had a lot of people who have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in Sland and the United States .
And a month ago , this moment was a moment that had been in the Island of Island .
CA : Vouu .
( Applause ) So let &apos;s give you a rare question , Juran .
What if you believe that the future is going to be ?
JA : I &apos;m not really sure that it &apos;s going to happen .
In all the world — in the entire world and the ABS-level , every place , in every place , in every place and the ABS-level , is increasing .
It &apos;s hard to see how the future will happen .
It &apos;s a lot of things that we live in , and we can change everything with a lot of things .
CA : I feel that the audience tells me what your audience means , Juran , the power of the power .
JA : Thank you very much , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m writing .
I want to tell you a little bit about the story , and I want to tell you a little bit about the story that I &apos;d like to tell you about , and I want to tell you a little bit about what &apos;s going on .
But let me just talk about the story of the story , and I &apos;m just talking about the story of the story .
Well , I &apos;m not going to use the words , and it &apos;s a little bit of it — you &apos;re going to go through a couple of pictures that you &apos;re listening to .
In Stasi , I was born in the species of France .
When I was in the end of this , I &apos;ve been stuck , and I &apos;ve been talking about my mother , and I &apos;ve been to the Turkey .
I &apos;ve been in the middle of the moment as a child in the history of the moment .
In the 1970s , the Antarctic was a little bit .
And in our medical diagram , the parents were wiped up in a lot of their ancestors , and I grew up with my mother who was sitting in Patrix .
In fact , I grew up in the case of two brown women .
It was the world , the world , the world , the world , the theater , the hungry Turk .
In the other time , there was a little bit of my grandfather , religious , less defense , less constructed .
My name is a lot of time in the case of the case , and it &apos;s a variety of things to make a look at what &apos;s going on .
And they can see what &apos;s going on in the room , and the people who were familiar with it are going to mind what &apos;s happening .
Every time I &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to get the whole thing , it &apos;s a little bit more determined to get the reduction in the way it &apos;s going to be reduced .
And then he was going to make a feature .
And then a week later , he went to the audience .
I know that this is how science it is , and I didn &apos;t see that the person in the person who was going to be able to talk to me is that none of the people who have been able to do a lot of the data in
I asked me how to do it . This is the power of the wall ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , there &apos;s the power of the walls , but the power of the data is the power of things . &quot; &quot; So , when you learn about it , there &apos;s a lot of time , and if you want
It &apos;s going to make it in the inside .
Each one of us is now , we &apos;re going to be able to see the data and the world .
It &apos;s all of us .
We &apos;re born in a very important family , different , signal .
But if you don &apos;t know about the world that we &apos;re good at , it &apos;s the risk of the risk that we have in the world , and it &apos;s a risk of the risk that we have .
We can reduce the power of power . We can tell you that we have a lot of human feelings that we find in a very long time .
Our friends , our businesses , our business ancestors , our business ancestors , and if we &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
And the women like my mother , they do something like this , and they &apos;re able to turn the top of the beauty , and they turn it into the diagnosis of the beauty .
This is what happens with the belief that a person is going on . It &apos;s not so powerful for a person &apos;s disease .
If it &apos;s a little bit , it &apos;s one of the biggest terrorists of our world who share it in sharing , and it &apos;s one of the greatest security of our world .
And this is everywhere , between liberty and the currencies , the agricultural and beliefs , and they are , in fact , they &apos;re the ones and the victims , and it &apos;s in China .
We &apos;re able to form the groups of groups , and the groups of the animals , and we create stereotypes , and we can create stereotypes .
I don &apos;t agree with me , it can be the way it &apos;s going to be the way it &apos;s going to get the data .
They can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be distributed in the way in our way .
And we can see the other worlds , and we can even see what we see .
I started writing stories from my eight years old .
One day , my mother gave me a clip , and he told me that it would be a good idea of writing that way to write the story .
Now , I think that I think it &apos;s a little bit of a bomb , and I think it &apos;s a little bit .
I &apos;m good to share my journey in home , but it was not good enough to talk about these stories , but it wasn &apos;t good .
I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to the color , and I was a little bit of an integrated kid , and I was an integrated kid , and he thought that I
But it didn &apos;t know that I thought that my life was a lot of more rare , and what I want to say is that it was a very uncomfortable experience .
And I began to write things like this , but I started writing things that didn &apos;t matter .
And I started with the writing of my own love .
And the fact that I was writing a lot more than a tropical manufacturer was the life of their heads , the stories of their heads .
So let &apos;s take a little bit of a little bit : I &apos;m a little bit of these things that are going on in my life .
And it happened to another thing in this circle .
It was the Amy diplomacy .
And I was also in the same time , and I was at the same time in the middle of the middle school , and I was in the middle school of the middle school , and I was in the middle of the school .
The first time I was saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the challenge to the typical X-ray . &quot; &quot; And there were children from all the millennia , but it created the revolution of the democratic democratic democracy , which
In fact , the kids in this industry have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get their eyes , not their eyes .
We looked at the United States , and it was really interesting , and it &apos;s just a little bit of a phrase for the good news , and it &apos;s going to be a dragonflies .
In this case , the kid would be able to turn out to say , &quot; &quot; He was always alive .
And the good thing was that I had been in the school in Turkey , and it was all turned into the Turkey , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve been able to kill the ceremony , &quot; &quot; and
( Laughter ) All of the time , I was able to figure out how to be a fabulous school .
The first time I saw it in this school , I saw a very stereotypical concept .
All kids , I didn &apos;t know , would give me a question of &quot; &quot; Midson Explorer . &quot; &quot; And they asked me to draw a couple of things in the day , and they &apos;ve been asked to begin to start the beginning of
And I learned about three statistics in the TV , and these are the politics , the head and the beginning of the head .
And after Spain , we went to Arabia , Alexoria and new Antarctica .
I think that I could take a little bit of my attention to the power of my privacy and the power of the power , all of our things .
The details of me have a sense of diagnosis and disagreement — and I was poor in the rest of this feeling .
I &apos;m very lovely in my 20s , I loved the Imetranm .
I lived in a lot of cosmos and a living business , and I wrote a couple of my hands here .
In 1999 , I was in the environment when I was in the field .
And when I saw the next three years of the building , I was able to be able to be able to get me out of the next three years .
He had a old hair , he was a old seller in the store , and he didn &apos;t talk to the young men and the original life .
He was sitting on a long hand , and he was sitting in the eye , and he was sitting in the eye , and he was sitting on the eye .
And I saw that he was able to make it out of the crowd , and I saw it , and I saw it in my idea that it &apos;s going to be in my idea , and it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going on in
And when we &apos;re scared with death and debate , our world is going to be a little bit of the world , and we have a lot of time .
And I believed that there was a challenge for the story of the story .
I don &apos;t want to tell you that the literature is so strong , but when you read a good roone , it goes away from our very little comfortable room , and we &apos;re going to start to describe the people that we don &apos;t have
After all , I went to the Boston , and then I went into the Moston .
It &apos;s not only geography , but the language of language .
I started writing English .
And I &apos;m a lot of the invention of my job , my mystery , which is the reason why my English writers are asking me to change my own language , and it helps me to change my own language .
I love it , and I &apos;m writing a little bit more popular and motivated . I love the text , and I &apos;m like , you know , I love the writer and me .
I think I &apos;m going to be able to connect other things .
I learned from a million people in the world , like a million people in the world .
So when you teach the language , you have to give them what they learn to learn .
And as they come from later , we want to talk more , we want to make better words , we want to make better words , because we &apos;re going to talk less about our brains and our language .
This is the difference .
But you can learn about it , and it can be an instrument .
This was what I &apos;ve learned in Boston — it was a gift that I lived .
And I would have been able to get my whole process to my own time , and I would be able to married my own time , and I could be able to live in a place when I was the idea of the idea of the idea of
And I had the life to love my grandmother .
( Laughter ) But in a place , I brought the Arizona to the Arizona .
And I started to go back to the Arizona of Arizona , and I was going to get the difference between the Arizona in the world , and I couldn &apos;t feel the difference in other kinds of things in the world .
I &apos;m a part of the physical and the spirit of the physical and spiritual .
It &apos;s always my story , and I &apos;m always the stories of the story , and I always have my story .
And I think that &apos;s how I think it &apos;s a lot more than the story , and it gives you a little bit of it .
I &apos;d like to want to have some idea for you .
One of the things I wrote in the United States is that when you saw light light in America , it was a joke .
&quot; The book came up . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re a little bit written . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked you to tell .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to see a lot of Spain , American , the American , the American , it &apos;s a person , but it &apos;s a person in the University of Boston . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a
But I know that I &apos;m not going to do it .
He wanted me to be a picture of my wife .
He wanted me to be a kind of kind of kind of name in the book because I was a species .
We can &apos;t talk about the world &apos;s world to change the world , and we can see that the politics of politics can spread and think that they can &apos;t be able to deal with it .
The writers are very , very , very , very much more than a lot of people who are not in the way .
If you &apos;re a woman who &apos;s in the Islamic world , they look at the name of the Islamic name , and it &apos;s better than the Muslim woman .
They can look at a lot more intellectual , sad , a little bit of typical stories , and you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
In the age of Madbridge , I &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be in the world of the world in the world of the world .
They look like the people who are a little bit of the ideas , not like the people who have a few writers , not like the most optimistic people , and a couple of writers , from China , one of the people in Turkey
It &apos;s not our life , but they &apos;re going to look at our identity .
In 1984 , when he took the Internet from James Breww , he gave him a couple of a couple of neighborhoods to her , and they gave him a little bit of neighborhoods .
The picture that took it to the Internet as a blue writer , and he said , &quot; &quot; So , you know , you &apos;ve got Benwin , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t have any other thing
There &apos;s a theory that &apos;s a very powerful theory of the whole writers that are not from the body , and it &apos;s a very powerful theory .
The 10 years ago , it &apos;s the first time when I was good at the Harvard Mountain in Harvard Mountain .
We were three writers , one of the things that we have from FIS , one of the things that happened to the Industrial .
( Laughter ) And it was not the only time we had to put us together .
We were alone .
They &apos;re looking at the great stories of the writers who have another millennia .
It &apos;s replaced in a literature .
And that way , they &apos;re not only writing , but they have an optimism of the bigger mass .
I have to do it , and it doesn &apos;t exist in the village , but it doesn &apos;t exist .
That &apos;s the whole world .
And I saw this in the first time in 2005 , and I saw that when I was able to do it in the first time in 2005 .
I had a lot of time , and I &apos;ve been writing a lot of people who have a lot of people with the eyes of the women and the other .
It was a great story of a great story of a great story .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what I &apos;m writing about the Turk River , &quot; &quot; they were asking me to make some reason .
But I &apos;d like to tell you every single time that I &apos;d like to tell you about every two minutes .
It &apos;s just a story .
I don &apos;t want to reduce the way I think you &apos;re going to say &quot; &quot; a story &quot; &quot; .
And I want to tell you how to deal with how the culture is not going to deal with it .
The writers are going to see the black eyes , but the political books are not the language of the language today , but the language of language is not the language of politics .
So this is what you say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the right thing of the problem of the year and the world . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s all different insights .
And it &apos;s the job to do the second . &quot; &quot; The politics gets us from one one of us . It &apos;s a literature .
One is a dream of hope .
The other things are different things .
One looks like this .
The grandfather doesn &apos;t know the other .
The politics was made out of construction .
The literature is from water .
There were things that were called &quot; &quot; manipulated . &quot; &quot; They were saying that they would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
They were going to be able to figure out the things that are different in the same way , and they were able to mimic them .
He would always listen to it , and people who are in the poor , the glamorous , the sensors , the sensors .
It &apos;s gone in the same ways . The Middle Ark , the polio Africa , the Balmans , and the Arabia spread , &quot; &quot; Minister &quot; &quot; and Arcsia .
Today , the stories are going to go to the destruction .
They don &apos;t want to be able to be able to meet one of the Pestestinians and Israeli politicians , but they &apos;re looking at the president of the terrorist script , and it &apos;s going to look at the story of
The literature has to take us further .
If you don &apos;t think about it , it &apos;s not good .
The books have been able to take me to a gift and a little bit of the baby .
But there &apos;s also the security of the books .
And after the Jewish River , the Roman River , after the Arctic Times , the first job , the first job , is that the first job of Rumi &apos;s book is to watch the word of Rumi .
And you can see , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you can &apos;t get rid of it , you know , it &apos;s more than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem today is not the problem of defense , and it &apos;s not the
I &apos;m a little bit of a view : we don &apos;t live like a design movement .
One of the masses of the neighborhood is fixed .
And the other thing is , the next thing is that it &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
One of the things I &apos;m going to do is a part of the Ichanical Turkey , which is the other part of the other part , and the other part is in the world , and it makes a sense of different communities .
This is my evolution , and I believe that I think that I think it &apos;s all over the place , and I believe it &apos;s everywhere .
You know , you know , you know , you can see the Type Center , and it would be the difference of 1400 years of October .
There &apos;s a place called the Council of the village in the room in the room .
It &apos;s the place between the buildings .
It &apos;s so much like this .
We don &apos;t believe that it &apos;s happening between the human beings .
It &apos;s a wonderful example of the world who has been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
And my idea is that there should be a lot of things that are going to be in the audience .
I give you a lot of leadership , and I &apos;ll give you a lot of leadership .
I love to think about 10 months later .
I love my colleagues .
I can write in one of my musicians in one of my musicians . And it will be a big good woman , and the other thing is that the teacher can be a great blue professor from Norway .
We can write everything that &apos;s going on from us .
It &apos;s called Audo Lorda , &quot; &quot; Our smart ancestors say , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I think it was
And I don &apos;t think , why do we learn about the things that you know ?
Maybe it &apos;s not very good for this beginning .
It &apos;s not dependent on what we know , who we know and how we know what we know .
We &apos;ve got to teach you that we feel like we &apos;re looking at the kids and each one of us .
We need to get rid of the people , we need to recognize other worlds .
It &apos;s kind of like some of the things that we have .
And we &apos;re not going to be in the political situation , they &apos;re a whole bunch of reasons , and it &apos;s good news .
I &apos;d like to end up with my voice , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re a friend , you &apos;re a friend , we &apos;re going to go to the way ; we love the world . &quot; &quot; So , thank you very much .

I &apos;m a great ideal , and it &apos;s a magical ideal that &apos;s going to be a little bit of a big deal in us .
And I &apos;m a little bit of an ideal ideology .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And there are women who are in the family .
women .
And I &apos;ve been able to deal with the story of the sun .
Two years ago , I went to the age of the dragonflies .
My job was a stand , I was my face , and my right eye was taken up to my right eye .
I began to understand the quality of the water .
I &apos;ve been looking at all the time , who I &apos;ve been talking about , and I can say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say that the way that
( Applause ) We &apos;re going to make women succeeded .
We &apos;re going to be the most likely to be in my mind .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because most of them are the courage of the goal .
And when it was taken out of a person in this case , the first time he was going to talk about four hours of hours , he started to talk about it .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I didn &apos;t know .
If it was five hours , it would be more interesting than five hours ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They &apos;re more likely to get a lot less .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of things that you want to do , and you ask , &quot; &quot; How are you going to go to the Vatinia ? &quot; &quot; If you ask , &quot; &quot; How are you going to do eight ?
You have to have luxury EQia .
It &apos;s not a good leader , not to be good leaders , but to be good leader , we can see that it &apos;s not a good leader .
We have the stories of our objects , and it &apos;s the same thing .
And I think Lehman Brothers , the great capitalist bank , and they didn &apos;t even have the Lohman Queen and the Bpain .
( Applause ) Ladies 7 hours , seven hours , seven hours or eight hours of night , he could see what would be reasonable , and maybe it could tell me why it would be .
In a way that we &apos;re facing with a lot of people who are useful , it &apos;s very useful for our life that we live in , and it &apos;s very good for our life , and it &apos;s the best of the whole world .
And I &apos;m going to give you a lot more to see that you can see the big ideals in the way to see the great ideals , the power of the surface , the power of the surface .
Thank you very much .

The brain of my brother — the brain of my brother is the brain .
What is the problem ?
Dr. Francisco Beneration .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , the people who have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
I &apos;ve learned that I was in my brain in my brain .
I was like a kid who was a child .
If you can see the brain , the brain is called a two-digit half .
This is the way it looks like the brain in the brain .
The right half of a parallel prosperity , the right half .
It &apos;s completely relevant to two pairs .
And if you think about different things , it takes a lot of different things .
I think about a moment . Thank you very much . ( Cheers : ( Cheers ) ( Girl : ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
The right brain is thinking about the images of our brain , which is the way we think about it .
In the same way that the energy of the energy has seen , it &apos;s the same way that it looks like how you look at all sorts of emotions , how it looks , how it feels , how it feels , how it feels , how it
We are a energy that has been distributed by the energy of our right brain .
In this point , we &apos;re perfect , right and eye .
The left brain of the brain is a completely different place .
It &apos;s a little bit of methods in the left half .
It &apos;s prepared in the center of the left half , and it &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s in the middle of it .
And the left brain is thinking about language .
We &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to make our moral world with our industrial world .
And that &apos;s what we have to do , and you have to take a bank in the moon .
What if we &apos;re saying we have to go to the battery battery .
And so I was in my own job , and I started to do it .
And it &apos;s a self-esteem that it &apos;s uncomfortable — it &apos;s an instrument .
I feel that I feel like I &apos;m slowly moving .
And that &apos;s what I want to do in the wall room .
&quot; &quot; I was my wife . &quot; &quot; I was my wife .
I can &apos;t feel in the wall and the molecules , and I can &apos;t feel .
And the thing I &apos;d like to feel is that it was the power of energy — power .
&quot; &quot; Why do you see it ? &quot; &quot; What do you see ?
I &apos;m all working in the place .
And I &apos;m going to make it documentary . You know .
You have your eyes for your eyes .
It was remarkable .
And my left brain is the back of my head .
And I &apos;m right now right now .
I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; Oh ! !
( Laughter ) And then he says , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m very glad ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be a chance . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to be
I want to pay to help , I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to do it .
I &apos;m trying to do it .
And when I went back , when I went back , I was crying .
So that &apos;s why it &apos;s a remarkable thing that I &apos;m going to give you to the story of my own phone .
I think I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about the Garden River . &quot;
Or how do they make my life in the life of the life .
And my brain is in the mind of two revenues .
How about my life , and how it is .
And I &apos;m going to be able to be alone , the power of power .
You can choose to look at our right brain .
