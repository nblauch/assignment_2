Now , the end of this year , we will have to be about the average person who is used to use <unk> .
And let &apos;s tell them what they &apos;re doing .
And while it was a thought , but I think it &apos;s a really good thing that I have , really , really , really , really , really , really .
And I thought about it after I was going to work in a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> that died from cancer .
My family was interviewing her family , and I started to write a foundation to be asked after his death .
This is what he did in the early days .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s my death , and this is my last day for the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to tell you how to my own body get rid of the breast cancer , my family and friends , I had a <unk> message that I wrote as the first part of my blog was to get out of my blog , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what my own body is to get to be better , and the more <unk> of the person , the right is that today , there are all kinds of things that were going to be used for every single year .
It &apos;s a little bit scary .
Now 48 hours of video of YouTube are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 200 million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> builds 90 <unk> per month .
If you &apos;re talking about your parents or <unk> and <unk> , they &apos;ve created a couple of <unk> , or a house video , or a <unk> that is in the <unk> .
But today , we &apos;re going to be an incredibly <unk> <unk> , which is going to live in a way that we have a long time to have a lot of time after our death .
And I think it creates an incredibly <unk> opportunity for <unk> .
For <unk> , I &apos;m a <unk> , not a <unk> , because I &apos;d like to be able to make sure that it &apos;s going to get the way that the future and the future will be <unk> .
We &apos;ve already seen some of the things that allow us to figure out what &apos;s going to happen to each other , and we &apos;re going to go to the rest of our death .
And one day , one of them , quite a lot , had found me in the front of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( <unk> ) Adam : <unk> .
<unk> : Adam ?
( Laughter ) Yeah .
<unk> : <unk> can take you anywhere at any time , even in your own .
And what is that ?
<unk> : <unk> on <unk> , &#91; I <unk> &quot; &quot; until too much .
( Laughter ) And this is a <unk> , or isn &apos;t it true ?
This object is doing so simple things : allows you to create a message or a video that can be focused on Facebook after your death .
Well , the second one &apos;s got 1,000 steps .
And it allows online to be online and <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , the videos and the things that they can bring back to your death .
But then it &apos;s just going to be done .
Many of you may have heard about a sudden , a lot of people who have been able to know how he had been able to do more than a few hours of <unk> video .
Now , I think with the ability to understand the power of a human language , a human being , and it &apos;s going to talk about information data , is going to be possible for life for life — <unk> , <unk> , video , <unk> , <unk> , that we &apos;re going to get out of the <unk> .
And I think as soon as it is , we &apos;re going to have a very good job to do this for the rest of the world , and then I think it &apos;s a way that we &apos;re going to be able to do that , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve created , and the technology that we have created is the meaning of the technology .
Now we &apos;re going to take a couple of <unk> .
There &apos;s some kind of <unk> — my <unk> <unk> , and he had all of your records in the room , everything you &apos;re going to do , and it turns out that you could write the next .
So , as you can see , the outcome can be <unk> .
Imagine what if you look at five , 10 or 10 or 20 years of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> step forward , <unk> <unk> , working on the <unk> that people can do .
And if it could be able to go to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , a hundred , hundreds of thousands of <unk> <unk> , which man has created life .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> from the United States in 2008 , in 2008 , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But what if we could use this technology to make our <unk> <unk> in the world , and they have a very , very <unk> , <unk> , and that they had created as they lived ?
Now , I think it &apos;s very , very , very likely to think about the data that we &apos;re going to have a data , and the ability to bring them to the <unk> in the <unk> .
As a result , I think we &apos;re all going to be thinking , or do we think we &apos;re going to be ? &quot; &quot; And when that &apos;s what it would mean for the rest of life and what &apos;s next .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You &apos;ve heard a heard of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first person was <unk> .
Another <unk> is from <unk> <unk> .
We really understand more about the reality of the reality .
I &apos;m sorry to answer those questions .
<unk> <unk> .
And that piece of a piece of reality that you want to understand .
And then we can do it again and they &apos;re <unk> .
We have to have a <unk> in the universe .
And these systems are <unk> , and these systems are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> fish , <unk> fish .
And interestingly , these systems are <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What do we know about the system of the system ?
It &apos;s like <unk> , even though it &apos;s a <unk> behavior .
And that &apos;s what we need to understand , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to understand , and that &apos;s what we have to do with the system , and that &apos;s what it is to do .
This is the system .
<unk> , literally the system is not separate from their parts .
And in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
But why not ?
Where is the electricity ?
We &apos;re going to go to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , I had more than an percent of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You may have noticed that nobody had ever seen before .
&quot; How did they get ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Are they <unk> ? &quot;
No , <unk> , <unk> .
These are companies working in more than one <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> .
On the top of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> net , where 600,000 people have <unk> <unk> .
And at the top 75 percent of all the <unk> .
And in the middle , the center of the structure .
But they were 95 percent of the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
But where is the answer to the question of what &apos;s going on ?
I make other things like what you need .
<unk> through the <unk> .
So the same thing , the same thing as it is that it &apos;s going through a <unk> grid .
And these main ones , these primary <unk> , are <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s some kind of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for everything , <unk> <unk> .
So I want to talk to you about what &apos;s going on in the way that we talk about how we talk about .
In fact , we &apos;re talking about this experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I think of this <unk> , you see a picture of a <unk> — like a man , he &apos;s going to the <unk> , he &apos;s not <unk> , he &apos;s going to go back to the <unk> , and he was going to go back to the <unk> .
And I think this is true , because it &apos;s not a <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our own self .
I &apos;m a <unk> and <unk> language , which means I &apos;m talking about words , I &apos;m going to spend my life .
You can say , and I would like to think that many things that we &apos;re trying to do to think about how many of them are , perhaps most of them , have a problem .
So love , we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
We were <unk> .
We were <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We get rid of the <unk> .
It keeps us crazy , and it makes us <unk> .
Put your hearts on and then the <unk> .
So , our <unk> , our <unk> , is to be treated with someone who is safe or <unk> .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s right .
And they bring us as a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And when you look at this word , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And when you get the value of this word in the <unk> — ( Laughter ) — you find that it means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , and it &apos;s a big deal . &quot; &quot; And as a rule , I put the words &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; with a very <unk> <unk> .
Only in one day , there &apos;s 16 <unk> on the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; which is in the <unk> <unk> of God .
( Laughter ) So we &apos;re going to get the words to talk about love , which is a <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
<unk> ?
So how did this happen ?
How do we get to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> ?
And why do we talk about this as a kind of kind of experience , how do we do that ?
It &apos;s hard questions , but I have a few <unk> .
And to do this , I want to go to one of the <unk> <unk> , which I want to do with love is a ridiculous thing .
When I first started to study my love , I put these crazy things about crazy everywhere .
The story of a culture of <unk> <unk> in the history of <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s a couple of examples .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just a ridiculous thing called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve always got a <unk> crazy thing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Look at me , <unk> , who are so <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to spend 20 years a year , and it was enough to work with the beginning of the beginning .
It was relationships at the top of the first few years , because it &apos;s a very high level of <unk> and <unk> .
I remember one moment .
I &apos;m going to put on a bed in a <unk> in the United States , and I &apos;m going to ask myself how I &apos;m going to take my door door to the door .
It was <unk> , it was almost a <unk> , and we were going to get out of our room , and when we went into our room , he threw it all in the way , and it &apos;s going to make it happen .
And I don &apos;t remember paying attention to this one last year , and I just remember how I had to remember it .
I was 22 , and that was my first point in my mind , and I was alone , and I was alone .
The <unk> week for my door to home , I knew the name of the city , which is the name of the city , and the name of the city that I needed to be able to get to be able to get out , but I didn &apos;t have to have a clue how to go around .
I didn &apos;t have a <unk> and very little money , and I didn &apos;t know what was going on .
And I could do this as a good thing for me , but it was a moment of opportunity , but I &apos;m a <unk> .
I &apos;m just walking there .
And then we got it back .
But even though , I had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a voice in my head in my head , and I thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> . It was <unk> .
I really am , I &apos;m really interested in doing it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because I &apos;m going to make a sense of my experience with my experience .
Now , this sounds really strange to me , but in 22 years , I &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> , and I was at that moment , and that moment , I was <unk> , and it was very strange , and it was pretty amazing , but I thought it was a kind of <unk> , and I thought it was a man that I had just left .
I think , in a way , I &apos;m going to be able to be <unk> <unk> , because I thought it was like love and work .
It doesn &apos;t really have to be a <unk> , and it &apos;s got eight <unk> , 14 songs , two <unk> and one thing called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; of love . &quot; &quot; A few hours later , he went into our room .
We &apos;re <unk> .
That &apos;s the real deal . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying that my first love would be like a little bit like a crazy thing .
But someone who is in this way — as as a way , it was like my <unk> , and it wasn &apos;t really good for me or for him .
But I think this is not a really good thing .
Most of us have got a little bit of <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s a kind of <unk> , which is what it is , because it &apos;s a <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s not so easy to do it .
It really is .
It &apos;s about 1999 , 1999 , to realize that the average level of <unk> is very similar to the people with the <unk> of the <unk> .
( Laughter ) So , it &apos;s also a difference in the middle of the <unk> , and it &apos;s also going to be done with the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
So there &apos;s a few things that love <unk> have to do with the rest of our <unk> and <unk> .
And the other thing to say is that the majority of people who are in this way .
Now , the reason that it is that the average person has been able to see a lot of people in the middle of the world , and they think about what you think about , as a sense , as a sense of how somebody gets in the head of your head .
And most of us feel like this , when the first time is .
It used to be a few months later .
When I went back to my journey in my 20s , I spent a lot of time on one in my room , I &apos;m going to share my <unk> .
And I decided that when my friends can &apos;t understand my very small mountain , I would give them a <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to get a little bit of contact with them .
And that was probably the same year in my life .
But I think I &apos;m going to make sure that it &apos;s my job , because if I was a kid , then I would be able to figure out what I was doing with him .
And when I do that , then we would end up in the end of the world .
That &apos;s a crazy thing , because there &apos;s no idea that it &apos;s going to be a rule , which is that the big thing is going to be a big deal , but we talk about love , as if it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s our experience , our experiences , our experiences , our own experiences .
Our <unk> says that love is a good thing to do with our <unk> , and she says that your love would be when you go to the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Well , the fact is , you &apos;ve heard about this — talking about the <unk> , which is just like a little bit like a little bit like a <unk> , which I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
( Laughter ) And our culture is given a language to make sure that it &apos;s about love .
So , in this case , we talk about a <unk> , and it &apos;s a ridiculous thing .
It &apos;s a pretty interesting <unk> <unk> .
And then we put it up and sometimes , and we &apos;re going to get it through our words and the stories , but then our stories , and the story of the story we &apos;re going to bring back to the <unk> and the <unk> .
And interestingly , this is all happening in a culture that is called <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to put it back and crazy , and we want it to make it live .
That &apos;s the sound of <unk> .
( Laughter ) To do that , we need to change our culture , or change our lives .
Imagine that we &apos;re all going to be less <unk> .
If we were more <unk> , more <unk> to the world , more <unk> .
I know it requires a lot , but I &apos;m not the first person to do that .
The book &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; who we live in , &quot; &quot; The Mark Mark <unk> , &quot; &quot; by George <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s a solution to this thing : We need to make our <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> , and they can even be able to learn how to make our own <unk> , like <unk> , who are <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> art .
And I love this way to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> said that there &apos;s a great way of thinking about what &apos;s going on , and there &apos;s a way to get all of the <unk> , or the ideas that go in in the middle .
<unk> and <unk> are told all the things that were going on on the <unk> of art : the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And these ideas are good at the beginning of the <unk> , and they &apos;re good at the same time , but they also work well , and in other words , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> — because these <unk> are much more popular ideas in the face of someone who had someone to do with someone .
So if your love is , it &apos;s a <unk> arts art , and so love is the experience of the experience .
<unk> <unk> , love <unk> , love <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And love is made of <unk> and <unk> .
You know , everybody &apos;s kind of <unk> .
When I was a <unk> , I never noticed that I could not get anything that I love love .
If the first time of the first time , the first time , if you had a <unk> , it couldn &apos;t be a <unk> , which she would have had four days ago , because she didn &apos;t have a <unk> or <unk> .
Where is she ?
It &apos;s going to be <unk> .
Right ?
And as a <unk> , at the time , the moment of <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is not <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> , he &apos;s just <unk> .
I understand that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when I read the read of this <unk> , I was 14 years old , and it was a good thing for me .
<unk> love as something that I &apos;m trying to do with , not what I &apos;m going to do with me without my own self , and it &apos;s a <unk> force .
But it &apos;s still hard .
Now , you know , you have to talk about a little bit of a while , and when I feel like myself , I have to ask myself my job : my job in these relationships is to talk to my partners about what I want to do together .
It &apos;s also <unk> .
But that &apos;s a lot better than the second <unk> , which love is crazy .
This is not about <unk> or <unk> .
Instead , it requires a little bit of a little bit of a partner , and when it becomes hard , it becomes difficult , but it &apos;s really hard , but it &apos;s actually a <unk> <unk> .
Because you need to stop thinking about ourselves and how to think about ourselves , or if you want to think about ourselves , and start to think that you are <unk> .
So this kind of <unk> allows us to say things like , &quot; &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not really good . It &apos;s not for us . &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; These relationships were <unk> than I am , but it was wonderful , but it was great . &quot; &quot; It was great , and it was a good thing . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a good thing that he &apos;s not going to get away from myself .
So this is the equivalent of what we really want to do , how it &apos;s going to look like it .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And I &apos;m still going to go to the <unk> of my car , and I &apos;m going to go to my car from the city of <unk> , which is in the front of the <unk> , the city of <unk> , that there are 5,000 miles away .
Well , you know how it goes , when you &apos;re <unk> and <unk> — we &apos;re not at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is the most <unk> path .
It was in the <unk> of <unk> , and I &apos;m going to go back to the <unk> , and I wondered what I &apos;m going to do about it .
&quot; What is it about the <unk> that &apos;s everywhere ? &quot;
She &apos;s got his eyes on his forehead .
And what the first thing to do is , the first thing to do with the first time is that the first person to get it right now .
( Laughter ) And then I was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , the <unk> , the ones that come out of the <unk> , that there was a little bit of <unk> . &quot; &quot; She had a few more <unk> , and then I got a little bit of a <unk> , because she realizes that , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; because it realizes that , &quot; &quot; <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a little bit of <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m about it .
( Laughter ) This one is a little bit of a <unk> space . ( Laughter )
In the last five years , I &apos;ve been talking a lot about this , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re watching the understanding of the world &apos;s understanding of the world , and how do we feel that when we do it , and that we &apos;re going to understand the story of human beings .
Now , I &apos;ve been running the last five years about the state of <unk> .
I have a career career , and I can do a piece of a career , but there &apos;s a big deal with it : a <unk> competition .
( Laughter ) In fact , in fact , most of us would have come from the rest of the world from talking about their own identity , or if you don &apos;t want to think about the opportunity to be able to think about it .
We understand that .
We know that sometimes everybody in this room is <unk> .
We are people , we are <unk> . Okay , let &apos;s get your way .
But when the right side of me , this moment , and I &apos;ve got an hour , and then all of the people who have been talking about a human being on the heart of a <unk> , and I can &apos;t imagine that it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in this case of an hour .
They have a <unk> , and they still have a <unk> , but they still have the same voice for their own voice and their voice .
At the expense of the study , we all live through the lives of the faith of faith that we are always right .
So that &apos;s the challenge for me .
In my view , it &apos;s a problem like each and every one of us , on a personal level , and we &apos;re all together as a society .
What I want to do today is a <unk> because we &apos;re going to get to the <unk> .
Secondly , this is why we have to do this .
And what I want you to do is , I want to tell you , you know , if you &apos;re going to be able to be able to get out of the <unk> , and when you do that , it &apos;s the best part of all of the things that you can do with the <unk> and the creativity and creativity that you can do .
So , why are we going to get into this <unk> ?
And one of the things that I had to do with this is one of the <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s get you , you know , because you &apos;re here , you &apos;re going to get your breath out , if you don &apos;t ?
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> . Okay , <unk> , wonderful .
<unk> , with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> — <unk> , all of them are giving the answers , but they &apos;re going to make a different question .
So , you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; &quot; Well , what you feel like you &apos;re not going to be <unk> . &quot;
( Laughter ) <unk> <unk> is a kind of kind of experience , as a <unk> , and a whole bunch of <unk> , not ?
For example , can be a sense of the feeling , or the feeling of <unk> <unk> , or even the sense of the experience as my own <unk> <unk> .
But the state itself is not <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
You know , it &apos;s all about every single person in this room , which is that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the world , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do in the middle of the rock , because it &apos;s a <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> .
But every time you get out of the cliff now , it &apos;s still the same .
And what happens is that it &apos;s just six years old , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s about to do .
It &apos;s just going to go wrong until he went down to the <unk> , and he didn &apos;t realize that she was going to go away .
This is what he was doing .
When we do something , not if you realize that the <unk> , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to go to the <unk> , and then it &apos;s a cliff .
Now , we &apos;re going to do that , and we &apos;re going to get out of it , but we still feel confident on the ground .
I &apos;ve got to tell you what I was saying .
There was some sense in the <unk> , which is the sense of their <unk> .
( Laughter ) So , what we &apos;ve done is that we &apos;re going to be able to learn from our <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to get this kind of <unk> <unk> .
With more , we don &apos;t have a little bit of a <unk> , which is if we &apos;re wrong when we don &apos;t .
There &apos;s another reason for us to do that , and it &apos;s more <unk> to culture .
Imagine having a <unk> school .
You &apos;ve got it , and you get a <unk> . It &apos;s one of them looks like this .
In fact , that &apos;s not my case .
( Laughter ) Here you are in your school , and you do know what to think about thinking about what it has got to get a little bit like this .
He &apos;s <unk> and he never does it .
So , for a long time , you &apos;ve learned that the <unk> , the people who are <unk> , who are the ones who are <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be successful , and they &apos;re going to be successful in life .
And we &apos;re going to get these <unk> <unk> .
Most of us , and as I think , are particularly important in this audience , treat it as well as <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Do not , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he still did , and he &apos;s also great ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like the beginning , you &apos;re all kind of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
The fly is going .
It &apos;s only when we think we &apos;re going to be able to do something that we may have in a different way .
So what &apos;s going on here is what we &apos;re doing when we make a <unk> , which is something that &apos;s wrong with us .
So we &apos;re going to focus on your own , because we feel like we &apos;re going to think of yourself as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Let me tell you about an example .
A few years ago , the name of the name is <unk> <unk> , a woman &apos;s name for <unk> .
This hospital is in the <unk> .
So this is a <unk> student at home from <unk> , and he &apos;s one of the <unk> in <unk> .
There was a woman who was born , and it was in the middle of the room .
It was a <unk> underneath her <unk> , and he was walking around her , and then she got her to her , and she got her off in the room .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> himself and says , &quot; &quot; Why do I don &apos;t care about this ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I do to do that , because they had a kind of <unk> <unk> on her , but not at the same time .
If you think about this <unk> , he said , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
&quot; &quot; In fact , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , he &apos;s been working on a <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why am I thinking about it , because I believe that you &apos;re going to look at what you &apos;re going to look at , which can be really good .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we all know all the time , is not <unk> , as you think of what &apos;s actually happening in the world .
And if we only think about it , we don &apos;t even think about it , we &apos;re doing a <unk> , and we &apos;re doing a little bit like a <unk> million <unk> <unk> in a <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> problem .
But it &apos;s also an issue for society .
You know , you know , it &apos;s a sense of the feeling .
That means your <unk> is a real reality .
With this idea , the problem is that the people who are aware of what you &apos;re going to do with .
Now , what most of us are willing to do with people with some other people with the other people with the other people in the world .
The first thing that we tend to think when someone is to us , is that they &apos;re not going to be able to make it happen .
They just don &apos;t have any information about the information that you have , and when you put this information with them , they &apos;re going to get them off , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> in your <unk> .
If it doesn &apos;t happen when we realize that they &apos;re going to be <unk> with us , but we &apos;re going to go to the other side of the <unk> , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re like to do .
( Laughter ) Before they all know , they need to be <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , they can &apos;t get it .
And if we don &apos;t work , if we realize that people that we don &apos;t have to do with us , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the same thing , but they &apos;re pretty good at all , we &apos;re going to get the truth , but they know the truth , but it &apos;s the truth for them to do that .
It &apos;s a disaster .
Now , the way that we can &apos;t do that , we don &apos;t give them a mistake , particularly when it &apos;s not a good thing , especially when it &apos;s not really good , and we give us each other to each other .
What I &apos;m more interested in doing , I think , really , is that this is something that is absolutely relevant to our human humanity .
<unk> , we want to believe that our bodies are a very powerful <unk> , that we can pull them out , and the exact same way we can see the light .
And we want all of you to get away from the same time , and we saw the exact same thing .
That &apos;s the same thing , and if it was , the light would be incredibly <unk> .
Our minds are not in the fact that we can see the light that we have .
It &apos;s something that we can see light not in this way .
We can have a conversation about the future , the future of the future , and we can imagine , like we &apos;re other people in other places .
It &apos;s because everybody sees the <unk> , we can actually see the most <unk> of the sky and see that , and that &apos;s what it is , and that &apos;s what it is .
And that &apos;s why we are .
It &apos;s about 1,200 years old as the <unk> of the word &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
And the idea that the fact that is that the fact that we have to do is , the fact that we &apos;re going to have a <unk> system , it &apos;s not a <unk> system , it &apos;s not something that &apos;s going to be a <unk> or a <unk> .
This is the <unk> of our <unk> .
Because we don &apos;t , we don &apos;t really know what happens in this world .
And from other animals , we &apos;re trying to try that light out .
I think it &apos;s a <unk> , and I think it &apos;s a <unk> , and I think that &apos;s the way that we live , and we have a <unk> .
<unk> , in many different ways , I started to listen to a lot of <unk> programs in the world .
And I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , and I started to experience that all of the <unk> are about the <unk> .
At first , I thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Now , I always think I &apos;m a crazy guy , see a <unk> .
She seems everywhere . &quot; &quot; There was a <unk> .
But after so many months , I &apos;ve been able to have a chance to talk to a good job at the age of <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get it out of it , and he was , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s really like this . &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , the teacher has even noticed that at every time , it &apos;s the most <unk> .
She said , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I thought something about this , but really happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting about it , &quot; &quot; the <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; is what we need to do .
We need to have a little bit of <unk> , and we need to be able to bring these things together . &quot; &quot; And the other thing we need to do is , we need all of us , we need to be able to do that .
We <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And the other thing that we have to do is , we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
But you know what our lives are like , because of our lives .
We think we &apos;re going to be like that , but actually .
George Bush thought that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the ability of people and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And actually what happened .
But also , the Greeks thought that it was going to be the end of the rest of my life , until the rest of the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> of the son of the son .
And actually what happened .
<unk> and you &apos;ve thought that it was going to work out and get out of school , and then you get into the <unk> , and how many of you have been able to do it all together .
And actually what happened .
I have to admit that I was saying that I was going to write a book about something that I &apos;m going to do , which I &apos;m not going to do , and I have to admit that I would never be .
And actually what happened .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s life .
We &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to get the light out of the world , which is — yes , it &apos;s — to the best , it &apos;s not . And the lights are not . And the lights are going to get us .
It &apos;s not <unk> , but the whole thing there is as a <unk> of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> the whole week of innovation , <unk> and <unk> , but you know why we need these innovation , <unk> and <unk> ?
Because half of the ideas that were mad &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; has the ability to change the world — at TED to see what is there .
( Laughter ) Don &apos;t go , don &apos;t it ? ( Laughter )
Where are my <unk> <unk> , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we &apos;re over here .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
We &apos;ll make another idea .
We &apos;ll make another story .
We &apos;re going to go back to another TED conference .
It &apos;s like you &apos;ve heard about seven million times as you &apos;ve heard about seven million times .
In fact , if you really want to be able to get rid of the <unk> , you &apos;re going to go beyond the limits of the world , and you &apos;re going to move space on each other , and then we &apos;re going to go to the <unk> and the mystery of the universe and the mystery of the universe , and you know , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I will . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Five hundred <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At first , there was a lot of <unk> in the <unk> , but he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he started to go to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , including <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But fortunately , these plans were the <unk> FBI agents .
But I &apos;m sorry , a <unk> at the center of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , a result of a <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is my father .
I was born in the <unk> , <unk> , who had <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
But when I was seven years old in our family , we began to see .
My father showed me that one of the little people who had seen a little <unk> of see , including even the majority of Muslims .
And my experience shows that when people give one one , they spend a lot of time trying to figure out what we want to do , and we want to know what we want to do .
But in every single year , every single one has a little bit of <unk> of people who are so passionate about what they &apos;re trying to use to use to use their <unk> to try to make them live on their own .
For a few months before my father , my father told me that a few of the last days he had to do with a friend of <unk> in the New York City Times <unk> .
He told me that I was going to go off with them .
We &apos;re going to go to the <unk> <unk> , which is what the FBI has done .
And that day , my last night , I had a little <unk> in a little <unk> , and I had a lot of <unk> , and I &apos;m in my last day .
My father was a friend of mine , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the father of the father and my son .
And it &apos;s very hard to do it , but only a few years later , I realized that it was completely different .
And they saw the <unk> of me as a father who was my father .
As a result of these people , the people who have been trained for the <unk> <unk> , which was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and this is the <unk> of a person who had been paid over a thousand .
These were the men who I had .
<unk> people , I <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot;
And that &apos;s my place to get 20 times , and that &apos;s my passion for my own ability to make friends .
Every time I started to experience myself in a single place , an hour of no matter , it &apos;s an hour , a little bit of stuff .
I &apos;ve always been doing a new piece in the classroom , and I was often <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to put my little messages in my life from my door to not write attention , but as a kid , for a new kid in the classroom in the classroom in the classroom .
I &apos;m playing games with play games .
Now , what my social skills were , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s not going to be the best way to go to your life &apos;s life .
I was trying to bring people to the <unk> of <unk> , like <unk> or race .
What does my eyes look like ?
The first of the <unk> who had been inspired by the challenge of this notion of thinking , was in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
A few years ago , I was able to get a <unk> from a <unk> in <unk> .
My group was violent violence .
Our groups are very different in the most different layers of society .
And then one day , looking at the end of the force , I realized that one of my new friends was a <unk> .
Because it &apos;s a few days ago , <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of <unk> .
I had never had friends before , and I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get a bar at the front of my life that I had just lost my life almost all my life .
The <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> park .
There are people in the world , and I &apos;ve got the people of the most vulnerable and cultures , and this experience is fundamentally fundamental in my own personality .
I don &apos;t have a good job anymore .
As a result , I &apos;ve been able to have an opportunity to be able to do this , and I was going to realize that many of them have been broken down and so I quickly realized that many of them were <unk> , and I quickly realized that many of them were <unk> , and I quickly realized that many of them were <unk> , and I quickly realized that many of them were <unk> , and I quickly realized that many of them were <unk> , and I quickly realized that many of them were <unk>
<unk> <unk> , <unk> in a childhood , and I had a sense of getting a sense of <unk> for others , and for me to be able to make good people right in the way that I would make sure that I would make sure that I was going to get me .
It &apos;s a sense of bringing me a little bit of a kid that I had in my childhood , with a <unk> .
I mean , I think it is to be a <unk> .
And then I was then , &quot; &quot; The <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to make my own identity of my own self , and I told me that race is a race that race , and I learned to understand that race is not a common job .
In many ways , he gave me a <unk> , which I had so <unk> .
<unk> are often coming out of it , and now I know that I &apos;m doing a good job that I &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> than my <unk> .
And then one day , I was talking to my mother about how I started my <unk> , and she told me something I &apos;m going to do with my own life .
And she looked at me in my eyes , and she looked at my eyes , and I had my eyes more than enough enough , and she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make a lot of people . &quot;
So at this moment , I realized how much power energy is going to be able to make sure that I can see this inner self .
<unk> <unk> is not my name of the name .
I &apos;m going to give him my family , my family , my family , I decided to try and start doing new life .
So let me give you a little bit of a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to ask you a little bit of a <unk> ?
Well , this is just a simple thing .
I &apos;ve been doing this in a sense that someone who has been given to me as a story , and that , in fact , instead of being the best person to do that , I didn &apos;t get a lot of money . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t become a <unk> .
Instead , I put my experience on my own experience against my own experience , which is a <unk> against <unk> .
I &apos;ve been doing this for <unk> , and for their family , for the extreme pain and the <unk> that they &apos;re going to take on their own share of the <unk> .
Now , memory has a talk about what I &apos;m talking about , which is what my parents can do with my parents .
I &apos;m a flock here , because the violence is not a part of a kind of <unk> or race , and that the son of my son is not going to follow my parents to follow my parents .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you so much . ( Applause )
Or maybe it can be a choice .
And they &apos;re not going to go to the other side .
Maybe it &apos;s less likely to do a big choice .
If I was a <unk> .
And I was in my own <unk> , and I was in my <unk> , and I &apos;m going to have a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to have a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to have a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to have a <unk> , and I was in my life in my life .
There was a study of <unk> and <unk> from all of the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s been <unk> because it &apos;s not there , because it &apos;s not there .
And so , as you can see , it &apos;s going to be a good choice .
But it can &apos;t .
When you make a good good , but it seems to be a thought .
There &apos;s an hour to family , and so forth .
<unk> , careers .
We have <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> .
And you &apos;ve created a <unk> for yourself .
I mean , if we do it , we can &apos;t do it .
I am one of those who love <unk> <unk> .
When we have a <unk> experience for ourselves .
You &apos;re going to be the same in the world .
A few years ago , and I decided to go to the journey , <unk> <unk> , Morgan <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get rid of these <unk> <unk> .
Instead of <unk> , it became a lot more <unk> .
This picture I did with my grandfather , when I was doing it every day .
I never got to get rid of it .
I &apos;m also <unk> .
In fact , <unk> <unk> is not going to go to sleep .
It &apos;s also a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Not when I &apos;m a <unk> , I can say , &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot;
And I realized that when I was doing a little bit of a transformation , the change that they were doing , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> <unk> .
In fact , they &apos;re <unk> .
( Applause )
I was incredibly impressed in the <unk> , which is that the <unk> of the place in the world to be <unk> .
In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women in the world were <unk> .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , no matter whether or they had a small place , or they had a small place .
They were going to go to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and they had 90 percent of women , and they said , well , they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
It didn &apos;t work at the end of the day , because it doesn &apos;t work if women don &apos;t work .
( Applause ) Five hundred years later , the <unk> had to be the first <unk> in the world , which is a <unk> strategy .
I &apos;ll never forget that day when I went to <unk> , and I went on to my house , and I went out to my house , and I went out to my house , and then I went out and I went out and I went on .
( Applause ) She became a <unk> <unk> for me and every person who was growing at that time , including <unk> .
She &apos;s often a story about the <unk> , which he had to get to her , and then she said , &quot; &quot; Do I have to be able to make it happen when you get a <unk> ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , these things are really important , but even with these kinds of powerful things that I was really surprised at , when I was offered a <unk> at <unk> <unk> , my first <unk> was , &quot; Who am I like to get on this <unk> ?
Who do I have to be <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> that women are less likely to be treated as a man .
<unk> , in 2011 , in 2011 , <unk> , that 62 percent of the men who have been able to <unk> their <unk> in the <unk> , but only 45 percent of women .
We see it 16 percent , and that &apos;s the same thing that it &apos;s going to happen because it &apos;s not a good thing .
It &apos;s a real <unk> , because I realized that this world needs a lot more and more motivated leadership .
And so my solution to <unk> was what I &apos;ve been trying to do with my own <unk> , even without a <unk> , <unk> , and let &apos;s go ahead and try to take a <unk> from the world of the world that we really need to do , and that we really have to get to our children , and we have to do what they want .
It was my life of my life .
It was wonderful .
It &apos;s been taken out of 20 <unk> <unk> .
And then , after the age of nine , the number was nine , and I finally got to race to us , three men and me .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not the drama .
<unk> , you know that the United States has a great drama , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can say , and we &apos;re in the <unk> .
First of all , the last 20 years of the last 20 years , which is that it wasn &apos;t going to be a <unk> , which is perhaps , and the lead is the same thing .
And then he <unk> when our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which had his family and his family .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> of the <unk> was that they needed a <unk> .
And after a couple of days , the connection to his family and her family was also found in his <unk> , and he was following it again .
And before I think , what he thought is that it &apos;s going to do it , because there are two people who have the other men who can make it .
So , 9 / 11 , for 45 days , right , on the right , is not good for me .
I don &apos;t even get a place in the <unk> .
And I had one percent , but I was one percent , but it was a <unk> <unk> .
And the reason why I had to tell you is that I had to get all the time to get my place to get my home , and I &apos;d go to the <unk> , because the <unk> decided to get out of a half percent of their voices at the first time .
And so the day of these <unk> , I &apos;m going to be able to get out there with three men and three men , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it was a half percent of the first day of the first time .
( Applause ) And the question is , you know .
The problems that have had to do with that , and we had to do that in the way that we had to do with the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
<unk> .
Some admit that the floor is given to me for <unk> and <unk> .
I can &apos;t <unk> .
And I turned out to be able to get access to the media as well as an hour .
Now , I think I was talking about this , and I &apos;m going to go through the age of 87 times in a couple of months before I get there , and I had 31 times over there .
And I don &apos;t tell you what the hell does it happen .
I mean , I think the reason is that the reason is , because , in the media , as well as the media , as well , there is a <unk> and a <unk> , and we need to be able to think about what we want to do when we want to change .
When I had access to tuberculosis , the first question was like , &quot; &quot; Are you going to make your <unk> ? &quot; &quot; It was a quick question .
<unk> , from one to two to two percent of the voices that we can understand .
But the media really has a value , and every time I was in combat , we saw it and felt like I was going to see , so I don &apos;t know how important it is , and why we need to think about it .
I had a <unk> , and I had never been to interview first .
Now , I &apos;ve been fascinated by the questions that all the rest of the rest of the rest of the world are , and outside of the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get out of it , but I &apos;ll tell you the <unk> of the media .
There was not a lot of people who are in the middle of my <unk> or <unk> .
( Applause ) The Chinese will be <unk> .
But there &apos;s another very important experience .
I &apos;m going to make sense of as a <unk> <unk> , without the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> experience and the access to the resources , perhaps , the <unk> of our company , but also , you can do something different .
Our company was <unk> , and we may have changed the tone for others .
Mo &apos;s at the reason for aging , because I wanted to show you a little bit of a <unk> .
When you have access to <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> the information information .
I &apos;m going to go back to Facebook , and I &apos;m going to go back to Facebook .
All of these questions together , we go to Facebook , we go to Facebook , because we went to the <unk> , when we went to the <unk> .
And when I turned out to be the <unk> of the young men , I started to use a <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to give you a sense of how to do that , and I &apos;m going to make sure that I was going to be able to get into a small part of the company .
I &apos;ve actually been able to do a lot of <unk> and <unk> , because I &apos;m going to get there .
But because of this , we grew up in the number of <unk> <unk> .
It turns out that the public and the other way .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m not talking about a lot of money , and I don &apos;t care about money .
It &apos;s true that it &apos;s true , but it &apos;s true , and we had less resources than other resources .
And the reason for the reason is that , in my view , it was an hour that I had an hour to do that .
And maybe , I &apos;m going to try to make more of the <unk> <unk> .
Some say it &apos;s a really good thing .
But even with the media and the <unk> , and it &apos;s only about the same time , but it &apos;s just a <unk> , and we &apos;ve been able to do it every day , when we saw the first number of numbers .
I &apos;m going to make sense of myself as you can see in the <unk> .
( Laughter ) The first data , I was going to get out of the <unk> .
( <unk> <unk> ) Oh too much , because I didn &apos;t make a difference , but I took a different place , and we were going to get a different way from one <unk> to a very small piece of voice , and we <unk> the <unk> <unk> , which was about 10 percent of the return of the last <unk> .
And I had a little bit of a <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a lot of people to do that over again .
But the fact that I &apos;m really impressed by is that I &apos;m going to make a lot more <unk> , and that was the way that I &apos;m going to do a little bit more <unk> , and a huge number of people who have been inspired by my <unk> in 2040 .
( Applause ) Now , it &apos;s 13 , and she never had ever yet .
But a day , I gave her a shock to her combat , she was a <unk> , she was <unk> , she was his mother , and she had his mother .
It was the <unk> of my company .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I saw my <unk> on the <unk> , and he had a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
This picture for me is already <unk> .
We can achieve what you see .
Yes , fear and problems .
( Applause ) And we need to go to the <unk> , and it &apos;s about the age of women , and it &apos;s going to be an hour of women , if you want to be able to do that .
I &apos;m also going to <unk> your New Yorker . &quot; &quot; I had a new <unk> , &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) <unk> , that &apos;s my most <unk> <unk> , because women are too often committed to <unk> <unk> , like I &apos;m a <unk> , but I know what it is , but I know what I &apos;m going to do when we do that .
( Applause ) And we have to use more of it .
So the day , we have a little bit like a <unk> , because that &apos;s what we felt like that .
And this is the <unk> of this <unk> .
We need to go to that , and you , you know , your family and my friends , everyone who &apos;s going to work with you when you &apos;re good , you &apos;re going to go back to it .
We &apos;ve been doing a good time , and I learned why I &apos;m going to do this trip , much more than I can tell you to the <unk> .
But if you think about it , it was a good job .
And I was sleeping with tears .
And so I realized that it was a good thing to do , and I realized that I knew what I knew about one day one day : you &apos;re going to go back to the same way when you get married , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with it .
So , as a good age of May , you &apos;re going to be able to <unk> your <unk> , and it &apos;s never going to kill you , but it &apos;s never going to kill you .
I want to be <unk> , and you all know all of this , in any mind , is your team .
The people around the world , who are looking for your values and their own , but they &apos;re going to go to the other .
And for me , this is a challenge of success , and I &apos;m a kind of an amazing question that today , the family of the family — ( Applause ) and I think we &apos;re going to look at this kind of success , and we &apos;re going to get something like that , in words , for the words of the people , the <unk> .
And as I said , I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make a decision that I would be good when I was seven percent .
And I put it on a point , because maybe he &apos;s right , and I think I &apos;m going to make a sense of <unk> .
But one day , one day , I decided to show you what it was .
It &apos;s a really important thing to do , because I really was very small , and I was really small , and I was working alongside people with me .
We &apos;re never going to be able to achieve a lot when we &apos;re going to go back to the story of yourself .
I think it &apos;s really important for two things : I think it &apos;s really important for people to do that , but not less important when it &apos;s not much more important when it &apos;s not much more important than the people and the people who are going to give you a <unk> , including the <unk> and the <unk> .
It &apos;s got me very much , and I &apos;m not going to focus on it , partly in part of my power , in part of my power , at all the time .
When I &apos;m going to focus on a while , it &apos;s an hour worth of time , because it was a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to go to my own causes , and not just like that , but in my <unk> .
I call our company <unk> , where G G means <unk> words .
The first of them is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to try to make a mistake , to be honest , and I wanted to make the leadership as a <unk> of our work during the company of the company .
Another word is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or <unk> .
So I decided to do this <unk> .
I could take it a lot , even though it was a <unk> .
And I &apos;ve gone all the way to take care of the other .
<unk> words : &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was a <unk> for everyone .
I didn &apos;t have any idea , you know , I had to look at Facebook or on our websites .
I think you &apos;re going to give the answers to your questions .
<unk> is less important than the words that we don &apos;t have to do in this room , and we &apos;re going to be a company called <unk> <unk> , which is the power of power .
( <unk> <unk> ) I &apos;m incredibly happy that I found a lot of people to find out to be able to make a difference , but to make a great difference in many ways .
I can &apos;t tell you that it was simple , but I &apos;m a <unk> , and I think that &apos;s the end of my team of <unk> , it was a <unk> .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : Well , I &apos;m not going to get you . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( PM : I can &apos;t tell you , I &apos;m not going to get you , I &apos;m not going to get you .
I mean , maybe all in this room are ready to go through the <unk> , and you &apos;re going to get to you .
We &apos;re not going to have the rights of the voice there , but there &apos;s something that we can get to be trained as well as it is , and that &apos;s what we can do .
I mean , you know , enough old enough to remember the 1975 of the year , when women are running out on the street , and it &apos;s really been a good thing to do with the launch of the campaign .
You &apos;re going to go on this before , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to get to yourself as a <unk> , which is in the <unk> .
And you can learn to know , because the media doesn &apos;t talk about it , but in fact , the women who are back on the street . Right ?
<unk> : Yeah . PM : Tell us to tell us about this ?
<unk> : 41 years from now , we can <unk> the place in the world to be honest , but our job is <unk> .
So <unk> , the women in the workplace , they have jobs , because that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing for this time , they &apos;re going to make their own <unk> .
( Applause ) So , what happened was that there was something that was broken down and the old ones who have been able to take away from a long time before , because it &apos;s an hour of the <unk> <unk> .
PM : Well , I &apos;m not going to talk to you now a little bit about it , but I &apos;ll tell you that there &apos;s a big thing to do when you &apos;re going to do it again .
Thank you .
<unk> : Thank you all .
( Applause )
In fact , I was trying to think about my career , and I &apos;m going to leave the house , and the best example I am — New Yorker , a couple of years ago .
<unk> <unk> , looking at the <unk> , says , &quot; &quot; Dad , if I grow up , I want to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> , because I &apos;ve got access to the world that people in the world have ever , to meet people in the world .
I &apos;m not alone at only 50 percent of America , but we have a little bit of my wife for a long time ago .
We &apos;re not just going to get out of the <unk> or the <unk> , but also the <unk> of the <unk> that are living in the most <unk> of Africa .
I mean , it &apos;s a kind of <unk> person , and you know the light that I know that I can say , I can say , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s so often your eyes on the eyes , it &apos;s the violence against women and <unk> .
There are a couple of reasons I &apos;m going to do .
And for that , this is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , New Orleans , <unk> and so forth , and so forth .
They &apos;ve been able to bring these things together to say that women are usually <unk> <unk> since men in the face of God .
A few years ago , the year 2000 , I was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the last 70 years — <unk> , and I &apos;ve gone to school every day , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> in 2000 .
So , they &apos;re going to be a <unk> , which is , in fact , the women of the women , to be <unk> , to be <unk> , and in fact , in a way , when the woman is in the classroom in a classroom in a classroom , she can &apos;t be able to do that when you go to the room , because you can find a <unk> in the room , and you can find a little bit more <unk> in the room , and you can see that a woman doesn &apos;t
But it &apos;s something that &apos;s going on , it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to work out in order to get men to be more <unk> .
It &apos;s a problem because men can be able to force the power , for example , when your husband or <unk> is going to want to be a woman who has to be treated with women .
Why do I have to pay for them for the same time ?
And the problem with the problem is that it &apos;s a <unk> for violence .
In the United States , for example , we had a <unk> increase in <unk> <unk> , and we have the <unk> of people who were in the United States .
One of the 1,000 Americans are in <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a lot of people with 1,000 <unk> in the world .
It &apos;s a massive increase .
Since I left the New York house , there was an increase in 800 percent of women in the <unk> .
We have one of the <unk> <unk> on Earth , which has ever occurred to me , with <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to get a place in one thing that &apos;s the most important place .
We &apos;re in California now , and I &apos;m going to give you the other day , which is that we &apos;re going to get four dollars per year to 13 , and they &apos;re in the age of 13 .
It &apos;s a human being on the <unk> .
Now , this is a <unk> law that has been given to a <unk> law , which is the <unk> of violence and <unk> <unk> , and people who are in one another <unk> of domestic violence against women .
I &apos;m going to be quite <unk> .
It &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> .
But in a few countries , in many countries , when the girl comes out , it &apos;s going to work in her life , and it &apos;s going to be the same as the <unk> of the <unk> that I have , and they &apos;re going to make a little bit of a <unk> part of the <unk> .
<unk> , the more <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , what a young girl can do so that a young girl can do something that a young girl can do so that a young girl can do something that a young girl can do so that a young girl can do something that a young girl can do so that a young girl can do something that a young girl can do so that a young girl can do something that a young girl can do so that a young girl can do so that a young girl
And then , when she got married , then she had to be able to get sex with sex .
It &apos;s not a <unk> , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s against the law against the law .
And for example , for example , the 91 of all women who lived today , who were living in this way today , were <unk> in this way .
Some countries have more than 98 percent of women who are doing so well .
It &apos;s a <unk> for all women who live in countries .
And the other thing that &apos;s really important is where the family was , I &apos;m with a <unk> , there &apos;s nothing in the idea that this is a <unk> , and when she was <unk> or when she was married , or she was married , or when she was married , or even when she gets married , even when she was a <unk> , she would even pick it up .
It &apos;s going to happen to her family , and as a parent , I becomes a parent , when a young woman has been so committed to the family in the family .
Not so long ago , it was a <unk> , and he showed that 75 percent of these young women are <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , 25 percent of <unk> women .
The challenge that there is in the world in terms of women &apos;s slavery , and it &apos;s slavery , or people like it &apos;s called today .
About a million million people were <unk> in the world in the 19th century and in 18 <unk> .
30 million people live today today .
The <unk> of the United States of the United States has come in order to make sure that every year , and the <unk> <unk> , every year , every year , 80 percent of those <unk> women who have been involved in mental slavery .
The United States is that in this moment , 60,000 people living under <unk> or in slavery .
Atlanta , the <unk> , where is the <unk> <unk> and where I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> of <unk> , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , people , people , people , people , who are the people who are in the middle of the country , and the two and 300 women people , people , people , are people .
This is a place of number one in the middle of this one .
There &apos;s also a lot of <unk> in the audience .
If you want to be able to ask , if you want to do that , you want to do that for 1,000 dollars to do that .
A young woman , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , can take over $ $ <unk> .
<unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So it &apos;s another very , very important problem , because there &apos;s no <unk> in America , and it &apos;s a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> .
This is the middle of one of the <unk> <unk> , the women and all of the world &apos;s entire world .
Now , this is a good approach to that .
This is about 15 years ago , a <unk> decided to change the law , and women don &apos;t even have the law on the law when they were in the world of slavery , but they &apos;re going to be <unk> , and they &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; — ( Applause ) — I went to a decline in a decline .
The United States .
One <unk> , 25 women in the United States .
Canada , <unk> , I &apos;ve already told you , <unk> , <unk> , and the other way in the middle of the country right now .
It &apos;s a different person on the right , which can be done .
We &apos;ve got two big ones in the universe , our <unk> and our <unk> system .
<unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> that I got to get told you that there was a <unk> .
But 3,000 , <unk> over one <unk> , and the reason is that any organization is going to be <unk> , like this one of my <unk> boat , or <unk> in the <unk> , is that it &apos;s going to be a solution to a solution to the <unk> , of course , of course , what they want them to do with them , they don &apos;t do that .
This is a law to be <unk> .
I mean , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and it &apos;s now a lot of <unk> in part of my book , and because of the other things , it &apos;s about 89 <unk> in America who has a <unk> degree of education in the United States , because it &apos;s going to give them a way to protect them from the domestic violence .
<unk> <unk> says , on the <unk> of the campus , because outside of the <unk> , when they give someone someone , but when they &apos;re going to focus on the floor .
They &apos;re not <unk> .
These are things that we have in our own lives .
And it &apos;s a very good thing to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; on the right , you know , you know , you know , you know . ( Applause ) And that &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
When I became a <unk> , it was 39 <unk> .
So , we &apos;re going to get the <unk> <unk> , and so forth — ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) — but in the last 15 years , it was just about 23 or 24 <unk> <unk> over the last 15 years .
This is what &apos;s happening now .
If you take 500 companies , it &apos;s 23 of them , with the 500 , and these <unk> , I &apos;ll tell you , the average one is less than the rest of the rest .
This is what &apos;s going on in our <unk> .
The second problem with <unk> <unk> : we &apos;re the most <unk> on Earth .
We &apos;re going to get in the war since World War II .
We were all in a place of <unk> .
<unk> together , we <unk> over the <unk> , the <unk> bombs .
<unk> , of course , we have <unk> .
We were in war with 25 different <unk> , even after World War II .
For years of age , I &apos;m not going to say that we &apos;re not a <unk> — ( Applause ) — we &apos;re not the <unk> of the bomb .
But in any case , those things that are given to the violence and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the primary violence against women .
The second reason is , the <unk> , the men of the <unk> .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
The guy who &apos;s going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , is the same thing that &apos;s going to be like , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s really like when I was small , when I was a little bit small , when I was a little bit small .
The <unk> <unk> , the end of the war between the <unk> , the World War II , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But for that time , there were many , many white people who didn &apos;t believe that they were wrong , but they didn &apos;t know what they were doing , because they were going to get their schools to break down , and it &apos;s the same . It &apos;s what we have today , because it was today , because this is what we have today , because it &apos;s actually what we have today , because it &apos;s not there today , because this is what we have today , because it &apos;s actually what we
Even when they say , &quot; &quot; I hate them to use <unk> .
And most of the men who are in the world , the vast majority of men , the <unk> system , the most of the men who are born in the world , and the most of the men who are going to be big <unk> .
Do we have to do that today ?
I would say , the best thing that we could do for women in the world as well as it is , and how do you think about it , and how do you go and forth and so forth , who has had to take advantage of ourselves to be more comfortable to end the <unk> of the world in the world .
A woman in <unk> doesn &apos;t tell me what to say .
But I hope that , after this conference , women are going to be able to get out of college grads and college grads , and in the future , in the market , and in the future of the market , we need to protect their <unk> and their <unk> .
I have 12 years old , raising the children and 10 years old , and I often think about them , and it &apos;s not only when they would have lived in their way to get out of the right , and I hope all of you are going to get to be a <unk> for women in the world , and protect them right .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
When I was in a <unk> here in the world , the future of the world seemed to be <unk> .
The growth of the population was not going to stop .
The <unk> was a <unk> .
<unk> cancer , the <unk> in the world , was going to be the rest of our lives .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s going to make a difference for us .
I didn &apos;t have it . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
In my life , I had a living life of 30 percent .
The <unk> <unk> on two three .
The food of our soul grew up on the ground .
The only thing that became more <unk> , in terms of how we &apos;re going to do this ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> the population of the population , and this <unk> shows the <unk> of the population .
To answer this question , you have to figure out how to make sure that you &apos;re going to know how to change your own , and the ability to express the ability to express , and the ability to tell you about how to do that , and the ability to answer , and the ability to answer to the question , and the ability to tell you about how to communicate , and the ability to tell you .
In other words , you have to figure out how ideas Have sex .
I want you to imagine what we &apos;re going to get from doing this kind of thing , which is what we &apos;re going to do with this kind of thing .
Over 30,000 generations .
<unk> , there were some changes , but the prize is <unk> in the skeleton at the time .
It &apos;s a <unk> phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s an hour on the right for five years .
And then I &apos;m going to make a difference in the way .
It &apos;s got to go from a lot of different <unk> , from the <unk> and the <unk> to the <unk> .
And more with ideas of ideas — ideas of <unk> , ideas of laser , ideas &apos; ideas .
They were <unk> in this technology .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s what technology will do for me , because I think it &apos;s the key to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
<unk> the body — also <unk> ideas : the idea of <unk> , the idea of the brain , the idea of the brain , is the idea of <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> together .
How is it going to make a sense of something like a <unk> or a <unk> ?
She was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> species , if you have two different kinds of different things in the world .
It &apos;s one of the things that I want to do .
The species in the world , maybe , could be able to get a person to get in a way to get in a lot of different ways .
So here &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> of all the species .
It &apos;s not a personal experience .
And what does this have come to do with the Industrial Revolution , which is in the <unk> of the world ?
And I think the answer is , the answer is , you know , the answer is , you know , the answer is a different kind of thing .
This is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is not going to do that .
The culture can survive .
Maybe a culture of culture .
<unk> , there &apos;s a culture .
They are taught by one of the ones that were taught from parents &apos; parents .
<unk> <unk> .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in many different ways .
They don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
So why is the <unk> of the standards of the standards of the standards ?
The answer came from the <unk> to the last year .
And he thought it was a concept of the 21st century that he has also been able to do in the <unk> of the world of <unk> .
Adam <unk> <unk> for four hours and three hours &apos; work .
Oz , Oz , &quot; &quot; Oz , &quot; &quot; by one hour and two hours &apos; work .
Oz , &quot; &quot; Oz &quot; &quot; in Adam and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
He can do the same thing .
When Oz , &quot; &quot; Hey , &quot; &quot; and Adam <unk> two <unk> .
It &apos;s a kind of thing that gives you a <unk> , which gives you the momentum to the <unk> , and so forth .
Adam and Oz , let &apos;s take time for your time .
Do you feel like , how long did you have to work , and you have to work , and you have to work with a little bit of a little bit like a little bit of a book , and you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a book in a book .
If you &apos;re first , you have to get rid of the <unk> .
How many are you ? There &apos;s a lot of time .
How many are you going to take to work for an hour of an hour , to read , when you have a <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re <unk> for a half seconds in terms of 1950 .
You &apos;re going to go back 15 minutes to go to that number of <unk> at the same rate .
You &apos;d have to work six hours to work six hours to go to the <unk> .
So let &apos;s go back to the <unk> , and he said , &quot; Who did they do for whom ? &quot;
The <unk> on the right was made for me other people .
How much does it do that ?
<unk> ? <unk> ? <unk> ?
You know , I think , the millions .
( Laughter ) to make a difference for me .
And that &apos;s how a society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve been in as a species .
At the age of hours , when you were <unk> , people literally worked for you .
And they were doing it , they were doing it , and they were doing it , and they were going to do it , and they were going to make it happen , and they were doing it in the same way .
<unk> the people in the <unk> pit <unk> .
But the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is also a <unk> man .
They &apos;re in the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to give you a little bit of food through an hour after the hour , the quality of which you &apos;re going to have to do with the <unk> .
So we can use the standards of everyone .
In fact , there are other things that are working on one .
<unk> is an example of an example .
<unk> is a <unk> for <unk> .
Even though we don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) When does this happen ?
It &apos;s a good job for the work of the work .
But I don &apos;t have to do that .
There is a good job for the food food food food .
<unk> of men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
You know .
And the guy knows that he doesn &apos;t have to be able to get rid of it .
And what we need is the <unk> , the <unk> .
I didn &apos;t do that .
They were highly <unk> .
They were very smart .
But there &apos;s no idea of what they had to do with their jobs .
There is no <unk> of women .
They said that women were born with men .
But there &apos;s no idea of <unk> <unk> , because there &apos;s a lot of people who were going to know what they were doing , because the tools they were doing , they were always made by the <unk> .
For example , there &apos;s a place where you have a <unk> device .
They &apos;re always made of a <unk> .
The same thing is , the same way that people have been able to do this very well in the same way that the world is , and it &apos;s a very good thing to do with that , and it &apos;s a very good thing to do with that , and that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s going to be very far away .
As a man began to <unk> <unk> in this case , this is the idea of what they &apos;re trying to do with the community .
It &apos;s got a little bit more likely to go for the <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> , in Africa , where we see that there is a little bit more <unk> , and it &apos;s going to take a long distance from the <unk> .
And the <unk> — as a result of this , was going to get 200 kilometers of <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
And that &apos;s what groups started to start .
And this led to a <unk> .
And they put them together in the middle of the room , in fact , in the way that they &apos;re going to do things like this , and in a way , some of the things that they &apos;re going to do in a building .
What &apos;s going on when people get out of their lives , from the ability of the <unk> and the <unk> ?
The answer is that it &apos;s not just the only thing that &apos;s going to be done , but it can even turn it into the <unk> .
It &apos;s a really good thing to do .
Now , the <unk> compared to people in the world , and they were really worried .
Because the population in 4,000 people were not allowed to be able to support their legal skills , they need to bring their technology to their own technology .
The worst didn &apos;t happen to the <unk> <unk> .
And the point is that there &apos;s a lot more <unk> from the United States from the United States to a lot more <unk> .
There were <unk> .
So let &apos;s go back to the rest of my life , and I don &apos;t know who I did for who I know , but who knew , how do we do that ?
Nobody , literally .
There &apos;s a person on the <unk> , you don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> , &quot; &quot; and nobody knows how to do it , because people who don &apos;t know how to do it , because they don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to eat . And they don &apos;t know how much the trees are , and they &apos;re all going to be the same thing .
What we &apos;ve done in the <unk> of <unk> , the path of <unk> and <unk> — we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we even don &apos;t understand .
It &apos;s not the same thing in the language .
But with the technology of the technology , the technology of the technology technology is technology for the technology of the technology .
In fact , in fact , I &apos;m not going to talk about a level of <unk> , or I don &apos;t have to give you a little bit more I.Q. than other groups .
It &apos;s absolutely not a <unk> .
In fact , my default value is how good people do their ideas , and how good they are , not what one person is .
We created a <unk> brain .
We &apos;re just going to go into a <unk> .
We are neurons of this brain .
<unk> ideas , <unk> and <unk> ideas of one of the same <unk> <unk> , <unk> , step for <unk> .
It &apos;s not less likely to make sense of it .
So the future , as we go forward , is not good enough to do things .
<unk> of war , depression , <unk> <unk> .
Now , this century , I &apos;m absolutely confident .
But I &apos;m sure , because of the things that people have , the ability of ideas , the ability of ideas , the ability to think about how much long as I never ever ever had , and I &apos;m confident that technology will be <unk> , and that &apos;s what technology will be .
Because through the <unk> , it &apos;s a little bit like a <unk> , and that &apos;s what you can see in the world , and that &apos;s what you can see in the world .
Thank you .
