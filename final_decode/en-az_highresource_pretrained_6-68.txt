Today I &apos;m going to tell you about the unexpected .
So I &apos;m going to see the sun in the sun .
And I &apos;m going to put it in a little bit , and I &apos;m going to take it into a little bit , and it &apos;s the way I &apos;m going to do it .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to look at different points of view .
It &apos;s just a little bit about what we do .
ha ... <unk> .
It may be a little bit <unk> .
( Laughter ) Now , we just — this is a <unk> — ( Laughter ) — not only ...
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) That &apos;s not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The sun is ...
Ah , you know ?
Okay . Thank you .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
So I want to tell you what I &apos;m going to talk about .
After a couple of days , I &apos;m going to get it to this . I hope you can see that if you &apos;re a little bit of your body , you can see that it can be significant .
So we &apos;re very interested in language language , especially the language of others .
The different aspects : ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause
<unk> : So they &apos;re going to take 10 of them home .
This is the lucky police officer in the US government .
There &apos;s a picture of your head — no . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
<unk> . We can &apos;t heal ourselves .
It was .
And the man was going to become the invisible .
As you see , it &apos;s the same , and people do the same .
It turns out that it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
And when I was a kid , we didn &apos;t know that we were not supposed to be able to do that .
Now , if somebody would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to give us the power of the force .
You know , we &apos;re going to make it <unk> .
What would you say ?
And I found that there was a lot of enormous pressures on my MBA .
Some of them are a leader of a leader , who is a leader in the middle of the class , where you can walk in the middle of the class , where you &apos;re still in the middle of the middle .
They &apos;re not going to replace two <unk> .
And I &apos;m not going to be able to do this .
They become little <unk> .
They were like they &apos;re sitting in the room , and they &apos;re not going to come up with this .
And so I &apos;m going to get a couple of questions for myself .
The first one is , you know .
And it depends on this .
So the women are much more likely to be done than they are .
They don &apos;t feel much more likely to do their own , and they don &apos;t feel that .
And it &apos;s a <unk> .
And it &apos;s very important because it &apos;s very important because they &apos;re very important , because they &apos;re very interested in their minds .
It &apos;s always the way we &apos;ve learned to be able to get to the <unk> .
And the guy in the same way , and the women are at the end of the course of the course , and it turns out that it depends on the part of it .
And I started thinking about it , and I was more likely to be able to do it in the way that you could be more likely to do it .
And if these videos are going to take these videos , they don &apos;t think that they are going to be able to get them to be more likely to be able to do that ?
He wasn &apos;t going to have a real estate thing .
So what if you could feel a little bit more powerful than you could see if you could see the change in your life ?
Now , we know , we know about the complexity of complexity , the way I think about it , and we have a lot of people .
But the question is , the question is , is that the question , and the question that you can &apos;t understand , and you can &apos;t understand it .
But we &apos;re not going to be able to do that , but we &apos;re going to do it in the way that we &apos;re going to do it .
So that &apos;s all two sides .
They &apos;re not the same .
We tend to feel that we &apos;re strong , and we tend to feel a lot more difficult to make sure that you feel powerful , but you feel strong .
It &apos;s not that you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And I &apos;m going to talk about the complexity of the feeling , the sense of evolution .
And the idea is that you can &apos;t see them , and you can &apos;t see them , and you can &apos;t see them , and you can &apos;t see them , and you can &apos;t see it .
What &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ?
They don &apos;t know , they &apos;re strong people .
You can &apos;t tell them two stories , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; you know .
And we want to tell them that we &apos;re going to give them up .
It was a <unk> <unk> game .
And it &apos;s about 60 percent , and it &apos;s a very significant amount .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to spend 20 percent of our time on the beach , and we don &apos;t know about 20 percent of them , and they &apos;re not going to increase the size of 10 percent .
They have these changes when they have these changes .
And they are the same .
They &apos;re <unk> by 25 percent , and they &apos;re going to increase the rate of 15 percent .
And in the two minutes in the sky , you know , the way our brains are more ambitious , it makes sure that our brains are more ambitious , and they have to come to feel that they feel comfortable .
You know , you know , you know ?
So , you know , you know how to think about the language of language , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s not just because you &apos;re not alone .
They &apos;re changing the way they do it .
The next question that I &apos;m going to tell you about is that a few of them may be able to figure out how to make a significant change .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
What do you do in real life ?
Now , this is what we &apos;re going to do .
It may be possible to be able to make the idea that this <unk> can be done by the social capital of this .
Where do you know ?
So this is a <unk> desk .
For some of them , it was a school .
For some of them , they &apos;re not going to look at it , or it &apos;s a job .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , because you &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
So we went on to the <unk> , and it took them large , and it happened to me , and this happened : &quot; &quot; What do we have to do ? &quot;
( Laughter ) So , you know , we &apos;ve done this idea . No !
You know , you know , you know .
And this isn &apos;t about you .
It &apos;s <unk> .
What do you do before you have before ?
You sit down . You sit down , you know ?
And this is what you &apos;re going to do , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , this is the thing you &apos;ve got to do , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
That &apos;s what we want .
And then we &apos;re going to be able to make a lot of work , and then we &apos;re going to get a job with a lot of work , and then we have a lot of work on a job .
And I &apos;m going to talk about five minutes .
To give you the <unk> of the <unk> , you can &apos;t use them to be able to use them to make sure that they &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
In five minutes , I was more likely to be able to look at what happened to be done in the future .
No one can do that .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And this is what happens when it comes to the brain .
To see them , they didn &apos;t see them .
And then we got four to four .
They belonged to <unk> .
We had to say , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; And then we want to say , &quot; &quot; We want to do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to know , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; We want to do that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to work in the details .
And I &apos;m more likely to say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the impact ?
They don &apos;t see them .
They depend on their <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to look at their other aspects of their experience .
Are there <unk> ?
It didn &apos;t have any difference .
And that &apos;s not what the most important thing is .
People are not alone .
So they don &apos;t believe themselves .
It &apos;s never been done , and it &apos;s not any of them .
And it turns out that this is the impact .
And I would say to people , you know , when you &apos;re in the middle of your class , you can change your experience , you can change your experience , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; This is not a little <unk> ? &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is not a little <unk> ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not that way .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
They &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
They don &apos;t have me to be involved .
I can see these words very well , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little story about what I &apos;m going to tell you about , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not my place . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you a little story about the feeling .
At the age of 19 , I was a very heavy <unk> .
He went out of his bed .
( Laughter ) So a couple of times .
And I had to go back to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I had to go back to the hospital , and the news is , I &apos;m going to go down to two <unk> , which is very painful .
I was a <unk> , because I was a very clever , <unk> kid .
So I &apos;m going to try to get back to my grandmother .
They &apos;re going to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to take a <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of stuff , but you don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , you know , I &apos;m not going to tell you what you &apos;re going to do , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do .
He felt totally vulnerable .
And I didn &apos;t know , I didn &apos;t know , I didn &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And so I &apos;m finished with a brand .
I had to spend four years in my class , and I had to spend four years in my office , and I had to try to make sure that I was a <unk> .
I didn &apos;t know .
And I was 20 years old , I had a <unk> of my career .
He was a night .
And I was going to say , &quot; &quot; No , no , you know , you know , you know , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; No , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And even though it is .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I didn &apos;t know .
( Laughter ) I really didn &apos;t know .
So I was going to spend five years trying to get a high school rate , and a couple of years ago , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to be there , but it &apos;s a long time , &quot; &quot; This is not my place .
At the end of the year after I was in my class , I was in the middle of the year , when I was in my class , I would say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to take care of you , you know , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to take her . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; This is not my place .
And this happened to me .
Because two things happened .
The first one I realized was that I was a very profound feeling .
But he felt that , and she was in the audience .
Second , it happened to be that she was alive .
So , that would have happened to go back to that .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you &apos;re right there !
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to show you the most important part of the truth , &quot; &quot; and you know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to look at the best of the world , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to have the best of my life . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A couple of months later that came to me , and I found that she was
He was at that .
And I want to tell you that .
( Laughter ) You know , you know , you know .
And I didn &apos;t feel like I was going to be able to do so much .
And I didn &apos;t know .
They can make a lot of progress .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you now about two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
So next time you &apos;ve got an interview , you &apos;re going to do it , you know , it &apos;s two <unk> , it &apos;s going to try to do it . You know , it &apos;s a table of the table , you know , it &apos;s a table of the table , you know .
Imagine if you can .
It was the best way I was in my life .
It &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; &quot; You know , I didn &apos;t see what I &apos;m going to say to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know what I thought I was going to say . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know what you would say .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell them who I am , and I &apos;ll show you ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell them .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to play with this , but I &apos;m not going to tell you about it , because it &apos;s a lot of fun .
It &apos;s not <unk> . ( Laughter ) And this is the people that you can &apos;t talk about , because people don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in the world , and the people who don &apos;t know what it is , and the people who don &apos;t have any of them .
You can &apos;t do that with them , but you can &apos;t use it .
That &apos;s because they can make sure that they &apos;re very significant enough to get them in their hands .
Thank you .
( Applause )
There are very many of you in the world .
It &apos;s the most important part of them .
It &apos;s like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , came in .
It was a very heavy , honest , very difficult to be able to do all of the transactions in the world .
Here , you know , <unk> , the 90 percent — they &apos;re the 90 percent .
Most of them work in action .
It was a little bit of <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
And this is the reason why this <unk> had been done by the <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to be able to see that it &apos;s a social , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
In the year after year , I was able to take the direction of my job to the <unk> of my job .
But this time , I &apos;m not going to do it .
And I was a lot more interested in art and art , and this was a lot of attention , and it helped us to get them to their own .
And this day , they were <unk> , and they were <unk> by the social capital .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that this is all the time I &apos;ve been in this world with this world .
In a lot of cities , I had a lot of <unk> in the world , and I got a lot of <unk> and <unk> .
And I came to my class , not only in the middle of the audience , not just the children .
They &apos;re not going to tell them , you know , in South Africa , in South Africa , even in the country .
And I knew that more people would have thought of that , because it &apos;s a big job .
After that , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause

So , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was a very large number of people who were born with the name of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it was done by the health .
Also , I was surrounded by <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There are other kinds of other <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And finally , I &apos;m not going to be part of this great , grand narrative that was made by <unk> <unk> .
&quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; Sao Paulo , <unk> , <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
So , everybody was <unk> .
In two years , 170 years old , 800 years old and 200 <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , who had a <unk> <unk> , and I would say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to be able to live in the world .
There &apos;s a lot of people who are not supposed to be able to go to the audience , and the people who have an audience .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Now , you can &apos;t tell you , and you can see the other invisible visible , and you can see them .
Try to see it as a whole as a whole , and it &apos;s all possible .
To believe you believe , you know , there are more than 20 million in the world .
If you had one of them , you could see them as a part of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , thank you .
( Applause )
Five years old , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but they didn &apos;t have a different set of points at the end of the day , and they were <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They were played by <unk> <unk> .
But you know , in the year 2000 , the Earth &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to die .
In the year 1919 , the Pennsylvania , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
And after my age , after my age , she began with <unk> .
My father &apos;s Islam made me realize that a lot of people have seen a lot of people .
And I learned about this , and I learned about these : the people who were able to see the same as it was the same as they were , and they were not quite a long time .
Every time I &apos;m a kid , I &apos;m going to have to have a little bit more likely to be able to get to the people that you can &apos;t see if you can &apos;t get any of them , and you can see that you can &apos;t have a little bit of your own .
A couple of months ago , my father had taken me a couple of years ago with a Ph.D. in London <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m not going to take the morning with him .
So we didn &apos;t know that we had the shot of the camera .
And my father helped me tell me that my father was going to come up with me , and he helped me see how it was 30 <unk> .
Now , this day , the last <unk> of the last <unk> , he got a button , he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re not going to fly out . &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to do it .
On the other side of the line , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And that &apos;s all that I didn &apos;t know , but a few years later , I knew what they were .
They &apos;re not going to come up with a <unk> , which is <unk> .
And these people are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is a lot of people who don &apos;t know what a lot of people are .
And these people are <unk> , and these people are <unk> .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is the people I &apos;m calling .
As I was 19 years old , I had spent 20 times of our place , and I had spent a little bit of my life in my lifetime .
And I would feel like you &apos;d feel a little bit more likely to be able to feel the way that you would feel something else .
It &apos;s always a new one of the time , as soon as I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to talk to you .
He had been hidden in the middle of the class , but it was obvious , but it happened to be the most <unk> and <unk> , the most <unk> and <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to read a book like a book , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and you can &apos;t play the game , or you can &apos;t play the game .
So , we have the ability to see that we have the ability to communicate with our social language , and one of the things that we have to be able to do is to make the truth of life .
And I grew up in a <unk> <unk> , where people were not supposed to die and religion .
What happened ?
And one of the first <unk> of this kind of concept that I thought was the first time in the year 2000 was the year 2000 .
And the software that you put in , you know , the way you go to the National Science Foundation , you &apos;re going to have to go to the National Science Foundation .
As I was a kid , I was in the middle of my class , and I had a lot of people in my class , and I had a lot of people in my life , and I didn &apos;t have to be able to do it .
There were people in the world of various lives .
And I learned that one of the people in my final book was a mother .
This was a couple of <unk> , but I realized that it wasn &apos;t the fact that it wasn &apos;t going to be anything like any of us .
When I met her , my friend , my friend , <unk> , I had a sense of a feeling that I had to be able to make me feel that I didn &apos;t know what I was going to do .
On a more important point of return , I found a job to be able to get the extra dimensions in the mainstream state .
And I was here , and I was the most important part of the people who had a different kind of experience , and this experience of experience .
It was a huge amount of faith in the world , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you have to
So I &apos;ve got to have a job that I &apos;ve spent the most likely to be at the forefront of the gay elite , the most likely that I &apos;ve spent a lot of life on the edge of my life , the most likely to be the most likely that I &apos;ve ever seen .
I was a kid . I felt like I was going to have a lot of time in my life , like I was going to have a lot of time in my life , I would feel like I &apos;m going to make a sense of what I &apos;m going to talk about , and I &apos;m a stranger .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to be able to give me the truth of the real lifestyle with the real lifestyle .
I didn &apos;t know how to be a <unk> , but it was very good at what it was like , but it was very good at what it was like to be <unk> .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; The <unk> Show . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; The <unk> Show . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; The <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it helped me tell you that it wasn &apos;t the case of the religious , religious and sexual beliefs .
You know , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to take care of you in the moments that you need to be a horse .
inspiration came from a very long time , and I had the idea of the world that I was going to be able to do with the world that I had never seen in the world , and I had the idea of the world that I had never imagined .
On a day , I was worried about the world &apos;s worth of the world , and my mother had a promise to me in my lifetime .
As my mother lived in my life , I was like , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to take care of them , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You hate to hate . &quot;
And I knew how much energy I would hate in the world of violence .
It &apos;s not my real step at all .
And when we decided to go back to our lab , we had to come back to our new lives .
Why don &apos;t you know why I &apos;m not going to die ?
They were very popular .
So , I &apos;m going to tell you that , maybe , I &apos;m going to make sure what I &apos;m going to say , maybe I &apos;m not going to see what I &apos;m going to do , but I &apos;m not going to realize what the wrong way is , I &apos;m not going to make sure that I &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that , you know , I &apos;m going to make it , and I &apos;m going to tell them that they &apos;re not going to die , and they &apos;re not going to tell them that they &apos;re not going to die .
And I &apos;m going to go through this kind of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to work with the very simple ones , but I &apos;m not going to go back to the way that I &apos;m not going to work with a <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t have to be alive .
I &apos;m not like my dad .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Every time I &apos;m a <unk> . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
<unk> , no !
You know ?
And I &apos;m going to take a step on them .
Don &apos;t anyone read ?
One day before I went to the restaurant , I was able to get the <unk> and <unk> .
I was a <unk> , and I said , &quot; Do you have ?
He didn &apos;t tell me that he was weird to me , but he was weird .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you ? ( Beatboxing ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I know what ?
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! Don &apos;t give him &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> ?
&quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; he said .
He says , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to talk to you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; If she had the highest girl in the world , she would say , &quot;
What do you mean , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; what ?
The young boy , the young boy , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
How would that look like this ?
So I started thinking about this .
That made me laugh .
This is a guy , really <unk> !
They don &apos;t want to come up with their own experience .
Could it be anything else ?
How are you here ?
But there &apos;s a lot of people here , like I &apos;m going to know that I &apos;m not just going to know that it &apos;s not just that you know that it &apos;s not just that you know that it &apos;s not the only thing that you have to know about the modern and cultural causes .
I &apos;m a whole , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ?
It would have been the best way to think about our brains !
And I don &apos;t only understand anything I learned in Arabic .
Don &apos;t you care about them ?
What are you here ?
Despite all of these , I didn &apos;t understand it .
I &apos;m not going to do it in the way that it &apos;s done me .
Arabic language is the answer to this day .
It &apos;s the language that I &apos;m going to talk about , and it &apos;s not a language that we have to share with a broad study , or the language of our civilization , or the language of our civilization , but it &apos;s not the language that we use , but it &apos;s not the language that we use .
If you look like this , they &apos;re our <unk> .
So what if I could use a date ?
You know , we have to use the language language .
This is a <unk> .
But there &apos;s another one that we have ever seen .
It &apos;s the mainstream language of Arabic .
And it &apos;s called a <unk> , which is a very good thing to know about other ecosystems .
And I &apos;m not going to figure out how to do the other <unk> in Arabic .
How ?
The first time I &apos;m going to get to the first time , I used to use the first time to go to college .
It was his whole organization , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So when she was in English , she had a lot of fun .
Even in English , you know , when you hear about it in English , you would feel that you would feel that .
You can imagine , you know , when you &apos;re in English , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
That &apos;s not anyone who cares about anyone .
The second one is , if you &apos;re a <unk> , the only way you &apos;re going to get a <unk> , the only way you &apos;re going to get the language of your body , the only way you get it .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
The Germans , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> — the <unk> of this <unk> .
So they &apos;re not going to be able to make their own <unk> .
They &apos;re not going to do that .
So they use a lot of money to build the language of the language , which is a lot of money .
We know more than them ?
Okay , we &apos;re not growing up in the world , but we &apos;re not going to talk about this idea , and we &apos;re not going to talk about our cultural world .
There was a time in which we had been developed , but for development , we were not going to be able to do it , but they were not going to be able to do it , and they didn &apos;t know , but they were not going to be able to do it .
They were close to their language .
Because if you &apos;re not going to die , if you &apos;re a product of a product or another village , you know , it &apos;s not a domestic product .
You know that it &apos;s a domestic product .
They are the <unk> , as they &apos;ve been before , and they are the <unk> .
So they became their own <unk> to innovation and to make it .
If I say , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what ?
Have you ever done , right ?
Don &apos;t understand how and why .
Language isn &apos;t just the same way that you can see it , but it &apos;s not a conversation .
Language is what we are capable of , and it &apos;s the way that we are connected to our civilization .
So , we are , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; and all of each of you have a special set of images , you know , there &apos;s a special generation in the particular day .
Language isn &apos;t about two or three or three or three words .
He &apos;s going to look at how we live , how to fix it , how to see it , and what we see is that it &apos;s not going to take us away .
What &apos;s wrong ?
And you can say , &quot; &quot; You know , this is a human problem , or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; and if you say , &quot; &quot; Dad , you know ?
What do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t solve the problem , you know , I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> and go to the empty .
And this is the thing that you can &apos;t tell us about this .
I have a friend of mine who &apos;s married with her sister .
And I asked him one day , how do I go ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is good . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m not going to make sure that every single day I &apos;m going to make a book out of the book , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) When I was a woman , I would say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then I &apos;m going to give him an example of the word .
And he said , &quot; &quot; How can the human possibly be so generous ? &quot;
Would he want suicide ?
&quot; You know ? &quot; &quot; This is one of a few <unk> .
And so we started thinking about it , because I thought that she was going to be able to get that word , and she was able to read that word .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to give you a picture of me , and I &apos;m going to make it a night for him , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I feel that when I &apos;m a kid , you know , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to make it out of the time . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And this is the problem
Imagine that to me .
( Applause ) What do we do to protect the language ?
We &apos;re not going to be able to do that , and we &apos;re not going to take this to protect the language of the language , and we don &apos;t have to protect the language .
Now , many people say , &quot; &quot; Why should you be anxious ?
This is a <unk> , and it &apos;s not a problem .
It was like , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to be able to read the language of the Arabic language , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to tell me if you don &apos;t . &quot;
We &apos;re not saying , &quot; &quot; No ! We can &apos;t get it . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t understand it , because we don &apos;t understand us in this way .
And one of the people I &apos;m going to talk to you about , I &apos;m going to hate it in a Arabic .
We &apos;re not saying , ( Applause ) We want to be able to have our own experience , and we &apos;re not going to be able to make our decisions , and we don &apos;t think that we can &apos;t do it .
We are the ones that we &apos;re not going to talk about , and we &apos;re not going to make us feel like we are .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to make a mistake , but you can &apos;t tell me the answer to me . &quot;
It &apos;s very simple , but also , it &apos;s creative and compelling .
And after that , we started with a different kind of <unk> .
You know , you know , you &apos;ve got to see this <unk> , a black hole with the black bar , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Why ? In fact , the language of languages .
We can &apos;t touch our language .
If we don &apos;t have a language of language , we don &apos;t know if we don &apos;t .
We are <unk> <unk> .
We are the rest of our community .
This is a critical challenge to the modern and cultural .
And after that , we were <unk> , and we were taught the girls &apos; girls .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is a <unk> .
We are very , very <unk> !
And who says , &quot; &quot; Ah , you know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how much denial is . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to make a better word . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to continue with &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to continue with &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go to the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because that &apos;s the case ! We don &apos;t know ourselves .
But if you &apos;re not going to say that , you know , if you &apos;re not going to get the point , you know , if you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on , what you &apos;re going to do is , you know , what you &apos;re going to do is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
They &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
And if we &apos;re going to fly the universe , we can &apos;t go back to the universe , and we can be very creative .
Each one of you in the brain is a very creative act .
It &apos;s a way of creativity .
So let &apos;s start with this moment .
Let &apos;s tell a novel , or a short movie .
The novel can make us global .
This is the product that we have to evolve with the language of the language .
&quot; &quot; There &apos;s no <unk> way out there . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a way to do it !
But we are in the world , and we have a way to be a part of the way that the way that the world is .
What can you do that day ?
Don &apos;t you know ?
And I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you a lot of you , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you a lot of you , you know , English , you know ?
But in Arabic in Arabic , I &apos;m not going to talk about the way we communicate .
( Applause ) This is a <unk> ! This is not language !
You will be connected to the world &apos;s language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back to a village like this .
This is the first thing we can do .
Second , there &apos;s a lot of other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not going to take this day to be here .
And we &apos;re not going to say that this language of language is not supposed to solve this language .
And I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about a <unk> .
The first time I was in my lab , I was fascinated by language .
When I was a kid , I would say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in English . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I
( Applause ) Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t understand this cultural adaptation . ( Applause )
And so a couple of years ago , the U.S. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I learned a couple of things that I had spent 30 days old .
And it happened to be a lot more likely to go through the entire world .
For a month , I was a painting every single day .
I had before I started 30 days old .
And I learned , I learned , but I learned that , I found , I learned , I learned , but I learned that , I found , I learned , I learned , but I learned that , I found , I learned , I learned , but I learned that , I found , I learned , I learned , but I learned that , I found , I learned , I learned , but I learned that , I found , I learned , I learned , but I learned that , I learned ,
And by the way , it &apos;s the same way that we can &apos;t make the words of the day .
But I didn &apos;t write novel .
He was very <unk> .
I don &apos;t have to say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to die &quot; &quot; .
No , I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot;
And I learned that it was a very small number of people that I couldn &apos;t make sure , and I couldn &apos;t make sure that they were the number of people that I could not make .
In fact , they &apos;re very excited .
( Applause )
The first day I started with was to hope and hope of hope and hope .
And I was a very good student , and I was very high , and I started with my opinion of my opinion , my opinion , and the way I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to work with the idea of my life , and the way I &apos;m going to work with my opinion .
It was a very , very profound , very compelling image of the student teaching .
Now , I &apos;ve got a lot of fun , I feel like I &apos;m tired of , I feel like I &apos;m tired of , I feel like I &apos;m tired of , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
But this is a <unk> <unk> .
It was so compelling that I couldn &apos;t predict , but I didn &apos;t know what I was going to do when I was a kid , and I couldn &apos;t predict what I was going to do , and I couldn &apos;t predict it .
Now , as I thought I had before , I didn &apos;t know what I thought I had before , and when I was in the middle of the class , I would say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to come in the room . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
And in the way it &apos;s going on , you don &apos;t look at the <unk> .
&quot; &quot; He &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> .
This was a beginning .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to tell you all the time you &apos;re on the third , you know , the third thing I &apos;m going to do , you know .
&quot; Well , she goes down . &quot;
And I &apos;m not going to be able to see the <unk> , and even a while after a while , I &apos;m going to be able to read and <unk> , and I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
So for instance , I &apos;m going to say that I &apos;m not going to say that I &apos;m a <unk> , and I don &apos;t really feel my voice .
I didn &apos;t have any kind of mess in my life , but I felt like I was going to talk about my life , but I felt a lot of people who were far too far away .
And I talked about the <unk> , and he came in .
And it turns out if you &apos;re not going to be able to do this , you know , the normal people are the sounds of the sound , and I &apos;m a serious <unk> .
He started with a little bit of <unk> , a little bit of <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to make a second largest problem .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I found out that I was in the middle of my class , and I saw my mother in the middle of my apartment , and I found out that she was in the middle of my class , and I found out that she was in the middle of his class , and she was a <unk> <unk> , and she was a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And I had this story , and I have to tell you about it , and I &apos;m going to talk about it .
And I &apos;m going to tell you at that moment .
When I was a kid , he didn &apos;t know , but she didn &apos;t even look at what I said , everything I said .
So for instance , I &apos;m going to try and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to take a student in school , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to watch the news . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to talk to the news . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know .
And after that , it began to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and then the most <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It was a <unk> <unk> , not <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
This was a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which was a kind of <unk> <unk> , and he started with a lot of <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s a similar amount of identity , like a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So for instance , if you could see them , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
As I was in the first three years , I was going to be more likely to be able to get the first to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to be more likely to be able to get a lot more . &quot; &quot; And particularly , you know , you know , &quot; &quot; You know ?
Where are you a <unk> ?
Stop , you know , I &apos;m going to put the water on the head of the teacher , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve done this . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And this is pretty obvious .
As soon as it was , I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I didn &apos;t know that it was a <unk> , and I didn &apos;t know that it was a <unk> , and I didn &apos;t know .
Two years later , it began to be <unk> .
I &apos;ve got to have all of my Ph.D. in all of my life : Scottish sounds , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and he told me , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to make it more comfortable . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to make it more comfortable . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to make it more comfortable . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit more comfortable . &quot; &quot; I wanted
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m not going to be able to get the right to the right , and I &apos;m not going to be able to see a <unk> <unk> .
A lot of people were wasted on me , and they were all of them , but they were very vulnerable to the people who helped me .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to spend a day , but I &apos;m not going to spend a little bit of a time
You know , Eleanor did this .
You know , sometimes you &apos;re not going to be able to see the word &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to come up with a great bow . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that there are a lot of people who are coming back to me , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
But they were the ones that they didn &apos;t want to be able to know , but they found that they were the ones that they had , and they were the ones that they had .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Of course , I didn &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s hard to say , you know , the first important step is that the first step of the first step is to make sure that the first step I &apos;m going to do is to make sure that the first step I &apos;m going to take on the first step of the first step is that I &apos;m going to make sure that the first step I &apos;m going to have to do with the first step of the first step of
So for instance , I had learned to tell you that I was not going to be able to play with a <unk> <unk> , not like my real and <unk> , but I learned to tell you what I thought I &apos;d like to do , I feel like I &apos;m not going to do it .
They were taught them .
In a night , I couldn &apos;t see if I had a night , I &apos;d never had to be able to get them to protect them , and I couldn &apos;t get them to protect them .
Now , because we have a problem with the problem of <unk> , we have to have a lot of training , and I &apos;m not going to have a lot of training , and I &apos;m going to be able to make sure that it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a bad thing .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You know , you don &apos;t .
Do you have a plastic bag ? &quot; &quot; And this was what happened .
Now , I was able to tell you a lot more important than I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what I &apos;m going to do , because you know what I &apos;m going to do when
You know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to ask them more , but I &apos;m not going to ask them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you the idea that you can see it , and I &apos;m going to be able to do it . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to start with the idea that I &apos;m going to have to be able to come up with the idea that I &apos;m going to have to be able to work out of the world .
And all of this has learned that every single one of them has been in the middle of every single tree , and I &apos;ve never learned to have a problem , and I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s not going to happen , but I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s not going to happen , but I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s not the same way that you can see it , and I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s not that you can see it , but I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s not that you can see
And I found that it was the way I found that it was the most important part of my life , and I found that the most important part of my life that I had was the most <unk> and <unk> , and I found that the most believed that I had the most <unk> and <unk> , and I found that the most believed that I had the most believed that I was the most believed that I was the most believed that I was the most believed that I was the most believed that I was the
And after that , after that , I had to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve got to make sure that I &apos;ve got a lot of people , but I &apos;m not going to be able to go back to the <unk> . &quot;
So the first time I was in my voice , I was going to say , &quot; &quot; 10 years ago in the history of history , I &apos;m going to be the most mysterious in the history of history . &quot; &quot; And after a year after , I got the most high .
One of the people in the room had to tell me the time .
In fact , I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s their own , they &apos;re their loved ones .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know what ?
At the same time , you know about two <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to spend a lot of time on my journey , and I &apos;m going to spend a book on a book , and I &apos;m going to continue with a book , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to continue to say , &quot; &quot; You know , the most important question I &apos;m going to talk about is not the wrong question .
And I &apos;ve learned to tell you that I &apos;m going to get them in a lot of time , and I &apos;ve learned to tell them , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve learned a lot about compassion . &quot; &quot; It gives you a sense of compassion , the sense of compassion , the respect of compassion .
And the most important thing I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to make a lot of people who can &apos;t talk about a woman who &apos;s going to take care of a woman in the world , and I &apos;m not going to help you find out how to do it .
So I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk>
It was the value of the respect and the nature of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of them .
It &apos;s possible to be shared with this kind of diversity , and it &apos;s already done .
There &apos;s a <unk> saying that it doesn &apos;t have a return back in the world of social change .
It &apos;s not going to be the person you want .
It &apos;s not going to be done to the people you want .
For me , I &apos;m not going to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to be able to see the justice of your career , you don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
In the last 20 years , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , as <unk> <unk> said , it &apos;s a <unk> , which is the way that we have to be able to use it .
In this case , it &apos;s the most powerful thing to get in , and it &apos;s going to be the most important part of one of the people who needs to be married , and you can &apos;t hope that you can do it , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to be able to share with you , you know , I &apos;m going to be able to share with you , you know , I &apos;m going to play with you , you know , I hope you &apos;re going
We are the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
We are . We are .
It &apos;s not going to take the stuff out of us , and it &apos;s not going to happen to us .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> once told me , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you what you &apos;re going to do .
You know , you know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to worry about the future . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m not going to talk about the future .
But what is this ?
Because , of course , this is not a picture of a <unk> image .
Again , when I was 15 years old , when I was 15 years old .
It &apos;s a little bit different , because it &apos;s a little different , because it &apos;s a little bit different , because it &apos;s a kind of <unk> process .
A picture of a picture of a picture of a computer , which is ready to be done .
And for me , it wasn &apos;t just true of the right place in the right time .
And I thought anyone could .
So what I wanted to do is something different , a picture of a picture of a picture .
( Laughter ) And I think that this is what &apos;s going on on a road .
But it &apos;s an unexpected game .
And nevertheless , it seems close .
Or , like this — but the dark side , but all of all of you can &apos;t be able to make sure that you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to make sure that you can &apos;t be able to be able to make sure .
<unk> <unk> , you know , you know .
Because , of course , these are not the images that we really have to be able to do , but with the camera with the camera , the images that you can see with the camera .
And I have to be able to get some of them with a little <unk> .
So this is actually a lot more likely to be able to make a lot more smooth .
So what would you say , what is it ?
You know , if you don &apos;t have that ?
Do you know ?
What is the molecule ?
Sometimes you can &apos;t make a mistake .
But in the end , the way we deal with the world is to figure out how to deal with it .
It &apos;s not really what it really is , it &apos;s really what it really does .
So the original concept is very straightforward .
And I &apos;m going to see that in a real way that I &apos;m going to make it a real difficult journey , I see if I &apos;m going to take a picture of my life .
Let me show you a very simple example .
Now , there are three numbers that we have to be able to see in some very different terms , and it &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> .
But in a certain way , it seems like the object that &apos;s alive .
And then we know that there may be no more .
So you don &apos;t play the game , because your brain doesn &apos;t know that our brains don &apos;t .
And I see the same process in which I see the same process .
This is actually a different kind of <unk> .
So what I think is a picture of a picture , I think none of the things that you think about , you know , I think about everyday things .
And if you don &apos;t understand it , you don &apos;t really have to do that , because you don &apos;t really understand it , because it seems to be a kind of wrong thing .
What I want to say is that we have three very simple rules that we &apos;ve got to make a clear answer .
You see , these images don &apos;t have a special face .
But you know , it &apos;s going to be done .
So the first rule is to be the same as <unk> <unk> .
Second , the same needs to be the same .
And in these two ways , these two sides of these two particles — the same is the same as the same .
Third , the pattern of the pattern , where one of the images was going to come from where one of the images was coming from .
So , how can we be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go through ?
We have the colors that we &apos;ve got from the image of the image of the images , the colors , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and yet , there &apos;s hundreds of thousands of years ago .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) People would think that this is the size of a <unk> , and you might think it &apos;s the bottom line .
But actually , this picture is totally different .
And I think it &apos;s a place where you can make a place where you need to change a little bit , and you need to change it .
But it takes a lot of damage .
And I knew that this idea was a couple of months to find a different map of the complexity of this idea , and to find out how to make parts of the brain .
For instance , the size of the fish is painting .
And they are different sizes .
The water was taken from six feet .
And yes , I can actually wear the <unk> of the island to make the house in the island of Sweden .
So , I think it &apos;s possible to be able to make a difference , which I think is possible .
Each time , a <unk> begins .
And then they come from different sizes .
It &apos;s like this , every single piece is very good .
And the good thing is , you know , it &apos;s pretty beautiful , and it may be very profound .
So , all of us have all the details that we have , and the only thing I &apos;m going to talk to you about is that you are .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Chris Anderson : Julian &apos;s fine .
There &apos;s a kind of information that has been done , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the world has more information than you could have in the last few years .
And this is this ?
Julian Milo : Yes , what is possible ?
The rest of the world is not like this , but it &apos;s a little bit more likely to go back to the world , right ?
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people die ?
How are you going to die ?
JA : These are the kinds of information that we &apos;re going to do with the information , and we have different ways to make this happen .
Try to make sure that we can make the information available to the rest of the Internet , to give the information to the rest of the Internet , to make sure that it &apos;s the way we do it .
It may be a little bit difficult to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a little bit more difficult to say , you know , it may be a little bit more difficult to be able to get in , you know , it may be a little bit difficult to be able to get in the world , and it can be a little bit more difficult to do , and it &apos;s a little bit more difficult to be able to do it .
CA : So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what ?
receptor : You know , you &apos;re not going to get them in a little bit , and if you don &apos;t get them in the middle , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
( <unk> ) <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : I think I &apos;m going to tell you , you know , I &apos;m going to code the code . ( Laughter )
And I think I think I &apos;m going to take a look at the <unk> .
This is a couple of years ago .
Let &apos;s look at this graph .
It was a story .
How would you talk about this story ?
JA : This is <unk> <unk> .
In 2004 , after 2004 , he was surrounded by Kenya .
A hundred years ago in 2004 , Kenya had been controlled by the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He was <unk> <unk> .
With the power of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And the government had been used by this time , and the most likely man , and the most richest man , they used the political force .
It &apos;s like the book of Kenya .
In the year 1919 , the 28 <unk> <unk> went back to a little less than a little bit .
This is a <unk> , a new mayor named Daniel <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , after three days , and after that , she was going to die after three days .
CA : You &apos;re not going to take a long term , not directly in Kenya , but you can &apos;t see the roads , and you know , it changed the way that it changed .
JA : Yeah . ( Laughter )
He came to a <unk> .
In a couple of days in Kenya , it began to be comfortable writing about it .
20 days , I was in Kenya with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
CA : So what really changed the world ?
JA : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : And this time , you have a video about the weather industry .
It &apos;s a little bit of a video . It &apos;s a little clip .
And in this video , we have a little <unk> in this video .
<unk> : ... <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , you know , it seems ludicrous .
<unk> . <unk> .
Now , the news is true .
It was a <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> !
( <unk> ) <unk> , go ahead , go on .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
They have to go back , now !
Right , we killed eight of them .
We have two trends , and we continue to work .
Right . He died .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> . What happened ?
<unk> , <unk> .
CA : What happened this video ?
JA : For the people who are in this audience .
For this video , we &apos;re going to say two of them .
This is actually one of the three <unk> .
CA : You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
JA : Yeah . Yeah .
And the man died , and she died .
CA : So , this is what happened to the vast majority of them .
What was the reason why this <unk> and <unk> ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think people don &apos;t know if they &apos;re going to die .
And I didn &apos;t have to be able to see that it &apos;s not that they &apos;re going to be able to fly around the world , but they don &apos;t even know if they &apos;re not going to get rid of them .
There were two sides of the <unk> and the <unk> of my own work .
CA : In the US government &apos;s security campaign , it &apos;s a <unk> , which is , you know , I &apos;m not going to tell you that it &apos;s a <unk> of the U.S.
Is this true ?
JA : So we &apos;ve got these inventions .
Five days ago , it was about 150 years old .
So this year , the U.S. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they don &apos;t have these workers .
And I was a <unk> of mine .
CA : If the US government would have a diplomatic service ?
JA : You can &apos;t fix them . ( CA : Do you know ? ) receptor : Yeah . ( Laughter )
And this is the kind of <unk> of the hidden <unk> .
CA : This is a little bit about detail .
You know , you know what ?
What do you do , the right thing ?
JA : There &apos;s a question that there &apos;s a question for the world , which can lead to what we do .
It &apos;s a lot of money .
For the example , the economic power of the economic force is going to be a new and good education , and it &apos;s going to happen to be a new and good education .
It happens to be all the time . It depends on this .
CA : But you know , you know , you know , when you &apos;re a little bit , you know , the people you &apos;re in , you know , it may be bad consequences for all of us .
JA : You know , it &apos;s not going to happen to me .
So , we have a <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s a lot of people that we have to do with the essence of the world .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> — it &apos;s like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what , you know , you know what it &apos;s like to see .
CA : I mean , all of you know .
And if you want to tell you that if the son of the United States is in the United States , you know , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , you know what ?
The people in the room show the <unk> .
It &apos;s not really not really that .
That &apos;s not my son , but what ? What is this ? &quot; &quot; What would you answer ?
JA : That &apos;s a lot of fun .
But you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t know , you know , the people in the world don &apos;t have to say that if you don &apos;t have that .
They don &apos;t get their idea . They don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t .
Every day I was going to be able to do that .
For this war , the people in the world are not going to die , but that &apos;s what you know .
CA : So you &apos;re going to make a way to build the government and the hidden <unk> .
It &apos;s good .
But the weird thing is , it &apos;s because it &apos;s the hidden secret to the <unk> , the secret .
JA : Right . It &apos;s not just too much .
Or it doesn &apos;t exist in the same way that it doesn &apos;t work .
If you think about it , it may be hard for us , and it may be hard for us .
CA : You know , you know , I &apos;m interested in thinking about it — what &apos;s wrong with this ?
There are two kinds of ideas about <unk> and Julian .
One — <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Who would say ?
What are you going to do ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s a couple of men .
CA : These were people , Julian .
It &apos;s a little bit more difficult .
And I think I &apos;m still going to talk about this , but I &apos;m not going to talk to you .
Isn &apos;t that an interesting mistake ?
And that &apos;s what happened ?
JA : This is a <unk> <unk> .
The last year I &apos;ve been in the last year , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So we &apos;ve got an example of an engineer , which is actually a way to live with the <unk> of the companies that the companies are going to be able to get to the market .
And I &apos;ve got a lot of fun , and I &apos;ve got the audience here .
There was no Photoshop involved with them .
We didn &apos;t know about who was writing and what it was about .
A little <unk> can be a <unk> game .
So , you know , if you look at the story , you can &apos;t answer the answer , &quot; &quot; we are a little <unk> .
We don &apos;t know how to fix it .
Okay , so you can &apos;t see it . You can &apos;t see it , but you can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , we want to find out that we can see that , &quot; &quot; We want to find out what we are . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We want to find a little bit , &quot; &quot; We want to find out a little bit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to find a
What are you going to talk about ?
Don &apos;t you want to tell you what ?
Is it really ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to get the owner of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t look like this .
( Applause ) You know , there &apos;s a lot going on .
One of the ways that we can make a mistake is that it &apos;s one of the ways to make letters .
CA : Do you have a <unk> ?
JA : Yeah , but it &apos;s a very , very difficult time , but it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
For the past a couple of months in the public community , I &apos;m not going to tell you the truth of the truth that you have to be able to come up to the future .
This is a little problem .
On the other end , we &apos;re not going to be able to see the same kind of data that we &apos;re going on , and it doesn &apos;t have a good enough to be able to do the data , even if it &apos;s a lot of data .
CA : I mean , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you the story that I &apos;m going to have to tell you about , you know ?
JA : Yeah .
The data is very difficult to make up the data on a very little different way , and it &apos;s hard to do it , and you need people to do with the security of the security of the security .
CA : So why would you say that ?
When we were on the beach , we were <unk> high school schools .
Is this information ?
JA : It &apos;s a <unk> movie , and a lot of religious <unk> was the result of two .
( Laughter ) CA : So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
receptor : Did you mean the movie ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : You know , when you &apos;re at the young age of the young age , you would have the problem .
JA : I didn &apos;t just know .
I was one of the young <unk> .
So I &apos;m not going to be able to see what I do when I was a young age .
They have a little bit of <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to make different things .
Unfortunately , most of the people in the world were going to go to the bank account for the Russians .
It &apos;s not like the before .
CA : You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
You can hear a little bit about them , or what if you want to make them a little bit ?
JA : I think I &apos;m not going to think about it .
But I think the story is : I think the people and the people in the world are helping us .
And I &apos;m my father , I &apos;m my father , and I &apos;ve learned that this happened to me .
CA : You know , you don &apos;t know , you know , you don &apos;t know , you know ?
JA : I &apos;m a little bit of <unk> , literally , you know , you &apos;re not going to get them , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And this is what I &apos;ve been finding for a long time .
CA : You know , you know what ?
There was a problem in which we had the problem , and the story of the news that they had had happened to me , and the news that they had had happened .
And I &apos;m not going to talk to you .
And what happened ?
JA : This is a big issue .
It was a economic recession .
One of the greatest parts of the world .
He was 10 years old in the banking industry .
It was the first year of the last year .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and he didn &apos;t know what he was going to say , &quot; &quot; I never thought about it . &quot;
And instead of <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m not going to be able to do it , but I &apos;m not going to talk about it , and I &apos;m going to talk about it .
Each single one of them had thought , &quot; &quot; anyone thought that this is going to be more likely to be done . &quot; &quot; So , as a result of a couple of years old , we had a new law of law , and after that , we had a new law of law of law , which is one of the most courageous aspects of the world in the world , and it &apos;s one of the most <unk> <unk> in the world , and it &apos;s one of the most <unk> <unk> in the
And I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to have a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to see the other .
And one month ago , this law is a secret to the law .
CA : <unk> .
( Applause )
How is it going to happen ? How is it going to be done ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s going to be done by all everything in the hidden sense of the world , or the people who are going to come up with the original , or what else ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure how to say it .
And all of the sudden I &apos;m going to talk about all of you in the world , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
It &apos;s hard to see what it is .
We can see very interesting things that we live in .
CA : I mean , I mean , you know what I &apos;m going to say to you , I mean , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m not going to be able to get the power .
JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m a kid .
And I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the story of a story , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about this story , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the same kind of thing that I &apos;m going to talk about .
But allow me to take them back to my own experience .
So I &apos;m going to use it as a result , and I &apos;m going to be able to get a <unk> — <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It was a little bit of a <unk> , and I was a <unk> , and I was a <unk> .
And that &apos;s the only kid in the world as a single kid .
He was a little bit weird to say in the 1990s .
And many of the people in the class had a huge amount of faith in the family of family , and the one who was the only survivor who was a single <unk> woman .
In fact , the woman who has two <unk> <unk> .
On one side , the <unk> , the modern , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
On the other hand , you &apos;re always going to spend less time , religious , less likely to get less and less <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the people who are very profound , the people who are <unk> , the people who are <unk> .
Every time I was in the middle of every time , I was able to get the red to get the red to get the red .
And then you &apos;re not going to hear a lot of you in your lab .
A week later , I was going to get sick for a week .
And I know that this kind of science may be like that , and I &apos;m going to tell you about that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m not going
And I said , &quot; &quot; I know how . &quot; &quot; What was this ?
He says , &quot; &quot; Of course , there &apos;s a <unk> , but it &apos;s the power of the story . &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot of important lessons , you know , there &apos;s a lot of important lessons , you know , there &apos;s a lot of important lessons , you know , I &apos;ve got a lot of important lessons , you know , you know , you know , you know , I have a lot of important lessons , you know , I &apos;ve got a lot of important
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Each one of us has now developed social and cultural adaptation .
We all were on her .
We all have a certain kind of <unk> , the ring , the son of the son .
But I &apos;m not going to be able to connect with the risk of being connected by a <unk> of the world that we are in the world .
We can make our power supply .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
There &apos;s a kind of thing that the women are like , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; the same thing , the same thing , you know , the same thing , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And this is what I &apos;m going to talk about .
And even though it &apos;s not , it &apos;s one of the greatest parts of our world in our world .
And this is where every place works everywhere , between the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
It was a lot of fun , and I couldn &apos;t tell you about it .
It may be a very difficult way to make this cultural adaptation .
Stories can be <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we can see that we can look at other worlds , and we can see if we can see them .
When I was eight years old , I started teaching stories .
And one day , my mother gave me a <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a good idea .
Now , you know , I &apos;m going to have a little bit of the idea of the idea of this .
He was very good at the school , and he was very good at the same time that these stories were not good at all .
I was a kid who was going to have a conversation , and I didn &apos;t know , I was a kid , and I didn &apos;t know that I was a kid , but I didn &apos;t know that my mother had a good idea for that .
But he didn &apos;t know that I was a little bit wrong with the idea of my life , and it was a book about this <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to write about myself , not about myself , but I &apos;ve been writing about it .
And so I went through my lab , and I started this .
I didn &apos;t know that I had a lot of other people in my class , and I thought that others were others .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Another thing that happened was another thing happened .
My mother became a diplomat .
And I &apos;m also going to take this little , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I was the only kid in my class .
The first time I went to &quot; &quot; typical <unk> , &quot; &quot; I had a very difficult force , and I had the kids in my class , and I had the kids in my class , but I didn &apos;t know what I was going to do , but I didn &apos;t know what I was going to do .
As soon as the kids , the kids are not their own , they don &apos;t believe their own , but they don &apos;t believe their own .
In the United States , it was a lot of fun , and it was a bad thing , and it was a bad thing for all of us , and it was a bad thing , or a conversation with a conversation .
They &apos;re always going to come up with a little bit of a child .
And I was good at this in school , when I was in this school , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) Now , I &apos;m going to talk about the way that I &apos;m going to have a lot of fun thinking about it .
And the first time I saw this in this school , I found that we could understand cultural adaptation .
All kids were asked by &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; questions about &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And I learned about three <unk> , and these are : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And after that , I was going to be able to make a <unk> , <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to be a library , and that &apos;s all of you .
Stories can tell me that I &apos;m not going to be able to make a sense of what I &apos;m going to tell you about , and I &apos;m in real life .
And I &apos;m 20 years old , I &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> in the Istanbul .
And I &apos;m very excited , and I &apos;m not going to get a live <unk> , and I &apos;m going on here .
And I was there when I was a kid in my class .
And I didn &apos;t know what I saw in the building of the building in the building of the building .
There was an old person , an old person who had a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It was a long black hole in the middle of a long black hole in the middle of the <unk> .
And I found that when I was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , I found out that I was going to be able to tell him , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to take care of your <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to die with a <unk> .
When the death of death and death are at the time , we &apos;re all very much of all of us .
Now , I &apos;m always going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a lot of love . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s strong . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;m not going to tell you a good novel , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t know that you don &apos;t have a good feeling , and sometimes you don &apos;t know about the people we &apos;re not good at .
And then we went to a little bit after that , and then we went to the girls &apos; girls .
It &apos;s not just geographic , but it &apos;s a complete shift in language .
And I started to make sure .
And I &apos;m not going to tell you what you &apos;re going to do , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to make sure that you &apos;re not going to be able to do the way I &apos;m going to do it .
I love the <unk> , the more I &apos;m going to get in , I think I &apos;m going to have a lot of fun , I think I &apos;m going to be more confident , I think I &apos;m going to have a lot more math , more mathematics .
And I think about every single subject .
I &apos;ve learned as a human in the world of English .
The language of the language is <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And as soon as I &apos;m born , we want to make better words , we want to make better words , and we have a little bit less , because our brains and languages have a big difference between our brains and language .
And this is the difference .
But it may have been a lot of fun .
And this was what I learned to — I lived , and it was a collapsed .
Now , I &apos;m going to take all of the rest of my career at the time of my career in my life , and I &apos;m not going to make my own work , and I &apos;m not going to be able to get a <unk> , but after that , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to take a look at the time .
God is a family of family .
( Laughter ) But instead , I went back to <unk> .
And I started to feel that my lifestyle was a <unk> , and I could make the difference between the other two sides of the world .
A part of me has always been a lot of fun , physically , physical , physical .
It &apos;s like I &apos;m going to spend all the time in the world , and I &apos;m always the time for me to come up .
And I had to say that I was going to have a lot of difficulty with that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re not going to have a lot of your own .
I &apos;d like to tell you about this idea of the issue .
One of the founders that I wrote in the book was that it was a kind of <unk> .
&quot; The book came to me . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m just a little different . &quot;
( Laughter ) So I asked what to say .
And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot of Americans , the U.S. , the <unk> , and there &apos;s one cup , it &apos;s the guy . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the guy , you know , it &apos;s normal .
But I also know that I &apos;m going to continue with it all the time .
He wanted me to have my own experience .
He wanted to be a woman who wanted to be a woman who was a woman in the audience .
And we can see the world &apos;s worth of the world , and we can see that we can &apos;t see the world , and we can see that there &apos;s a lot of progress , and we can see that we can &apos;t see it .
Most of them , especially when they &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
But if you don &apos;t know about the Islamic world , I &apos;m going to talk about the Islam of Islam , which is more likely to be a woman .
It was more likely , sad , the typical stories of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the world is a world of mine , which is the world .
It &apos;s not like the creative people , not like the creative people , but you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a few writer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
In the year after year , I was asked by the writer , James <unk> , a couple of times a couple of times .
And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to have anything to be a blue writer , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to have anything wrong with you . &quot; &quot; And the same is what I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to have anything wrong with you . &quot; &quot; And the same is the same . &quot; &quot; The same is the same . &quot; &quot; The same is the same
There &apos;s a <unk> of a <unk> called <unk> <unk> .
About 10 years ago , the first time I was at Harvard University was a good student .
We were three .
( Laughter ) And the thing that we put us together is that they &apos;re not going to come together .
It was alone .
They &apos;re not really interested in teaching stories of stories .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
In this way , they &apos;re not alone in the way , but they become more powerful than their own .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s not a story , but it doesn &apos;t exist .
It &apos;s all over the world .
The first time I saw this in the year year , I saw a <unk> <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to talk about the eye of the woman with the eye of the eyes and the <unk> .
It was a huge macro problem of a <unk> <unk> .
And some of the people I talked about , I had some of them , some of them made me angry , some of them .
But I &apos;d like to say two of all the time in this moment , I &apos;m just going to say that .
Just a story .
&quot; &quot; Just story , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make a story . &quot;
It doesn &apos;t see how to deal with it .
They &apos;re not going to see if they &apos;re not going to be able to see the <unk> , but they &apos;re not the language of the political community today , but today , the language of our everyday lives .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And the task is to do it . &quot; &quot; <unk> , you know , you know , you know .
One has a lot of fun .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
One is a front .
The front is the front .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re the water from the <unk> .
There was a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; They were the stories that they didn &apos;t know , they didn &apos;t know stories .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to express the different aspects of your life .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Stories are <unk> . The Middle East , North Africa , is spread like &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And today , stories are going on .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
They don &apos;t get us far away .
If you don &apos;t know that , it &apos;s not good .
It &apos;s a time that you &apos;ve got to have a long time ago , and you get rid of them .
But there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
After the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the first job he had to read the first job in the world was to watch what happened in the water .
So , you know , you know , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell you that you don &apos;t know you &apos;re going to die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry that you don &apos;t know you &apos;re going to die . &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> : I &apos;m not going to live with the type of action .
One of the things that you get is a mess .
On the other hand , the endangered species , the endangered species .
And I &apos;m not going to be surprised at me .
It &apos;s a part of a <unk> <unk> , which is a part of the world , and the other part of the world is connecting the world together .
And this is the same way that I &apos;m going to be able to do the same , but I believe that there is an area of where it is .
Now , I think I &apos;m going to be able to see the <unk> <unk> , which is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
There &apos;s a place called an image of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s where it is .
That &apos;s a lot of this .
We &apos;re not going to say that we &apos;re not going to be a <unk> .
And so we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to come up to the map , and we &apos;re not going to make sure that it &apos;s a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to make sure that it &apos;s a <unk> .
And I think it needs to be a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I love to talk about 10 after 10 .
And I love my experience .
Now , I &apos;m going to play a book about the woman in the world , and I &apos;m going to be a happy chance to be a happy person .
And we can see all of the things that we can see .
He says , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; says , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; Ah , you know , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m a great example .
And the reason why we don &apos;t understand why we &apos;re not yet , but we &apos;re not going to talk about the things that we don &apos;t know .
Perhaps not good for this .
What we are , we know about who we are , and what we have to do is not depend on what we are .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that you can &apos;t hear about it , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You know , you know , you know , you can &apos;t see other worlds .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
You know the political state , you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s great .
You know , you know , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s talk about the ancient arts of the ancient arts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s talk to you , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to get the way you know , the world is the world . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
It was a little bit of a little <unk> that I had had a little bit of <unk> .
I &apos;m going to make this little <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here &apos;s a <unk> of A <unk> .
It was .
( Laughter ) And I decided that I had to deal with my grandmother .
Two years ago , I was going to be able to make a <unk> <unk> .
My head <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And so I started to figure out what I was going on .
And I &apos;m going to get to that , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to know , I &apos;m going to tell you that the only way to be happy is to be a normal way of being happy .
( Applause ) This is the women of the women in the country .
The most important one is the most important one .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because there &apos;s a lot of truth , you know , because you can see a little bit of <unk> .
When I was a scientist , I was going to talk about the clock of the night when I was a kid in the middle of the night .
And it turns out , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know .
Could it be more interesting if you could have five hours ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So many of you are less likely to get less .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to invite you to go back to the morning and say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s eight years old ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s eight years old . &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
You have to have a <unk> .
It didn &apos;t become a good leader , but it was a great leader to be a great leader .
They &apos;re not going to make sure that they &apos;re not going to die .
And I think that the <unk> Brothers has been the right to be able to have the right to be able to have the right to be able to have the right to be the right to the right .
( Applause ) It &apos;s about 24 hours a half hours in <unk> 7 or eight hours , or eight hours , or eight hours , or eight hours , or eight hours , or eight hours , or eight hours a day .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is the most important one in the neighborhood that we live in , and it &apos;s the most effective for the entire world in which we live in .
And I &apos;m going to tell you a lot more , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve discovered the power of your life .

So the brain is the brain of the brain .
What &apos;s the problem ?
Dr. <unk> <unk> .
&quot; &quot; <unk> people , &quot; &quot; the people who came to know , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; the people who came to know , &quot; &quot; I want people to come up with the people that we want to know . &quot;
And I learned that I was a disease , too .
I was a kid who had a <unk> kid .
And if you can imagine the brain , the brain is two different sizes .
And this is the part of the <unk> .
It was in the middle of the right age .
They &apos;re made by two <unk> <unk> .
When I think about different things , I &apos;m not interested in different things .
And I &apos;m going to play a minute . Thank you .
The right brain is the way we think about the way that our brains work .
It &apos;s the same as possible that we can see how to live in the same way that we &apos;re going to live in all the time , and how to do it , and how do you feel , how you can see it , how you see it ?
So we &apos;re a <unk> of our right brain with the power of our brains .
So we &apos;re at this point , right , right .
The left brain is a totally different place .
This is what I thought was going on .
And we took the information from the left , and we took the information out of it .
And the right brain is thinking about language .
They &apos;re not going to make the world out of the outer world .
And this is the voice : &quot; &quot; When I go back home , I &apos;m going to walk home .
When you know what you have to have , you know what ?
So I was in my own school , and I was going to try to try and try and try and try and try and try and make sure that I &apos;m going to make sure that you can see it .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I feel like I &apos;m going to move the wheel .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
&quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel anything , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know .
The only thing I &apos;m passionate about is the power of the outside .
What happened to me ?
Now , I &apos;m all going to come up with all of you .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
You know , you know , you &apos;re not going to see you .
He felt sick .
And again , the left brain is back to the right brain .
And that &apos;s right now right now .
<unk> is now , &quot; &quot; Oh ! ! ! !
( Laughter ) It turns out , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a lot of <unk> ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t . &quot;
You know , you have to have a job , you know , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to make a call .
And the rest of the rest of the rest of you have to go back and forth .
So that &apos;s one of the things that you have to have , the numbers that have happened to be a <unk> .
Again , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t feel like the Golden <unk> . &quot;
What if I could teach my life to my life .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And it turns out to be a different kind of between two sides .
And how is it that you have a huge amount ?
Or , you know , I &apos;m not going to be strong .
You know , you &apos;re not going to get your right arm .
